Satoshi hoped that fees would be sufficient to incentivize miners, but many experts think that the system-wide incentives aren\'t right for this to actually happen as Satoshi expected. Some possibilities are: miners motivated by altruism will provide sufficient security; users will add enough fees to incentivize sufficient security even though smaller fees would be enough to get transactions confirmed (maybe due to wallet defaults that people are too lazy to change); the safe max block size (determined by network-wide bandwidth, CPU, and disk speed/space capacity) will just happen to be low enough to create enough scarcity to promote enough fees to incentivize sufficient security; the max block size will be artificially limited (via something like flexcap, for example) to create enough scarcity to promote enough fees to incentivize sufficient security; miners will find other ways to sustain themselves, such as by engaging in contracts with businesses; businesses and individuals will choose to donate to miners using [assurance contracts](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contract#Example_3:_Assurance_contracts).\n3.

This time difference is called the _delay_ or _latency_. A short delay means you can perform the operations many times per time unit (higher frequency), and longer delay means you can perform the operation fewer times (lower frequency). Simple circuits tend to have lower delays, where more complex ones tend to have longer ones. Hardware designers compute the delay of a circuit and set the operating frequency at a 'safe' rate, where they can guarantee correct results every single time.\n\nSo what happens if you choose not to wait for the signal to completely stabilize?

Right now there\xe2\x80\x99s a proposal for a hard fork of Bitcoin called \xe2\x80\x98Bitcoin Classic\xe2\x80\x99. It\xe2\x80\x99s called that for purely marketing reasons, it would be a new fork, the adjective \xe2\x80\x98classic\xe2\x80\x99 is a lie, but for clarity I will continue to refer to it by that name. The technical details of this are a little silly: Classic has a doubling of the block size, but rejects an upcoming proposal which would have the same effect, resulting in it being incompatible with no tangible benefit whatsoever.\n\n> Where Classic would be almost not incompatible is that everyone who owns Bitcoins would immediately own both Bitcoins and Classiccoins. This creates massive confusion in transfers: If you want to do a transfer to somebody else, are you supposed to transfer Bitcoins, or Classiccoins, or both? Some counterparties will only accept Bitcoins, either on principle or because they haven\xe2\x80\x99t done the requisite development, some are going to only accept Classiccoins, because they\xe2\x80\x99re partisans, and some will try to be conservative and require transfers of both. Inevitably Bitcoin and Classic will have two completely separate valuations. When stocks split their combined value doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go up. You can\xe2\x80\x99t create value with accounting tricks. The sum dollar value of a Bitcoin and a Classiccoin will be no greater than a Bitcoin was to begin with. That\xe2\x80\x99s assuming that the chaos won\xe2\x80\x99t result in an overall price drop. A plummet seems more likely.\n\n> People expecting both Bitcoin and Classiccoin will be viewed by some as attempting to steal, even though they\xe2\x80\x99re merely asking for the full quantity they were expecting before.

Payments sent from Bitcoin-only wallets will have overt stealing as the receivers take the transaction which paid them and add it to Classic, thus claiming funds which aren\xe2\x80\x99t rightfully theirs. The security level of both will be less than Bitcoin was before, because mining resources are split between them.
