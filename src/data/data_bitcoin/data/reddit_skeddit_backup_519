Ok, I might as well share my reply:\n\n"Sadly I don\'t have much time to provide input. However a wallet should be simple and straightforward to use, hide any and all of the technicalities of Bitcoin. At the same time it should be as safe as it possibly can on the platform you are using.\n\nI personally like breadwallet a lot. It comes close to perfect - there are some additional features I\'d like to see implemented, but in terms of usability it is outstanding.\n\nThe next steps in wallet development IMO are multisig and replacing QR-codes with bluetooth-comms. Security and convenience, indeed.\n\nIdeally, my (2/3) multisig wallet should be compatible with other multisig wallets. So, I sign a transaction on my phone, and my paired multisig wallet sees this and asks confirmation for providing the second signature. Apparently this is currently not possible because there is no easy way of letting the other wallet know that there is a multisig transaction pending. Such change likely requires a BIP - but don\'t hold back be to write one, this is how innovation continues. The change would involve allowing partly signed multisig transactions to be distributed across nodes, so that your paired wallet can query a node to discover whether a multisig transaction is pending.\n\nAlso, again further ahead, the entire concept of an "address" should be abolished for the user. The user should be able to create a number which acts as a bank account, and also works just like regular bank account. I want to be able to give out my Bitcoin account number and receive payments on them, anonymously ofcourse, using stealth techniques. The account number can just be a serial number that is created deterministically from data in the blockchain. This would be a huge improvement as most non-tech people understand bank accounts, but have a hard time getting the counterintuitive concepts of Bitcoin.\n\nDrawing the parallel further, I\'d like to see a two-account setup. One account would be for small, daily payments up to a user-specified amount. The cash in my wallet. No multisig. The other account would be my bank account. It would be multisig and be used to top-up my daily use wallet. This should be a standard setup across all wallets, IMO. Standardization, effortless security and predictable behavior is really the key.\n\nOne other nicety would be the ability to lock in USD or EUR values of a wallet using derivatives. So, the wallet offers the user to lock in a USD value for his/her bitcoin for a certain time period, and autonomously makes the necessary trades in the background to achieve the lock.\n\nOk, more input than I intended to write, but hey.

I am only working on the Android version, iOS is a completely different team. PIN is on their list for next release afaik, though. Having the password entry popping up with a question is an interesting idea, I'll put that on our list. The reason you cannot import another master seed is that we want the app to always just have one seed. It's already tough to get users to make backups, if their backups only work for half of their accounts money will be lost. Your use case is perfectly valid, though. With our next release, there will be the option to do cold spending from a seed. So you can scan a QR code with the word list, wait for sync, select an account, spend from it and the wallet immediately forgets the seed again. That way you could at least empty your seed to another account or address. Maybe we should allow users to type the seed in addition to scanning? And I will put a point on our list to better explain creation and deleting of HD accounts - they are all based on the same seed. Unless you import some xpub or xpriv. ": 1, 'Unfortunately Electrum does not support the same recovery mechanism as TREZOR and Mycelium does :-(.': 2, 'Thanks very much for inquiring for feedback and for your commitment to improving your product. There were several confusing things about the process that could be streamlined to make it easier for the user.\n\nPerhaps it would be best to have a pop up screen ask the user if they have a password after one puts in the seed. That would prevent someone from putting their seed in (having not checked the box) and then arriving at the outcome that I did. Better still, have the password screen pop up no matter what and write leave blank if there is no password. That is what Electrum did. Also, definitely give an instruction to distinguish between PIN and password. That is not 100% clear.\n\nAs I already had an HD account on Mycelium but with a zero balance, it seemed that I was unable to create a second HD account to import the seed, which was a bit frustrating. The software said "you can only have one unused HD account" or something similar. When I tried to delete an account it had a problem too. I think I received something like "You must have at least one account." at least once, but I do remember being able to delete once too. I couldn\'t find a way to import a new HD account from the user interface. There should be a way to do this that does not involve reinstalling the software, or it should be more clear how to do this. Of course, when one first starts Mycelium on a fresh install, it prompts you do import a seed which is what I wanted to do.\n\nIf I could have easily restarted the process again, spotting the box to check would have been a bit easier. Having to reinstall was stressful because of the amount of money involved. Not seeing the balance pop up is heart rending, especially when an error screen doesn\'t come up, as one can imagine. :-)\n\nTrying Electrum failed-- it brought the balance but wouldn\'t let me spend. As Slush pointed out, they are not yet supportive of Trezor seeds. Ultimately Mycelium worked. \n\nYou guys are awesome. I really appreciate the work you do. I would also happily suggest some improvements to iOS wallet if you are interested-- firstly PIN protection.\n\nKeep up the great work. :-)': 1, "Electrum doesn't use BIP39, like Mycelium and Trezor do.

But I don't know the cause of its low value now, why is it getting so low?": 1, 'Yeah why not. I mean lets look at your options.\n\n1. The most obvious; keep it in Euros. Put your 1000 euros in a savings account and sit on it. This is the worst choice because its going to lose money. Euro inflation against the US dollar over the past 12 months is something like 40% its insane. The Euro is teetering on the brink of being worthless. So keeping it as Euros is the worst idea.\n\n2. The stock market. This is not going to be an option for you because you usually need a brokerage firm which puts up all sorts of hurdles first of all you would have to be over 18 and you\'d need a lot more than a thousand. They would have a minimum portfolio and it would be a LOT more than that.\n\n3. Index funds. Track the economy, however I think the economy is about to go down the toilet. You would be investing at the worst possible time in my opinion.\n\n4. Invest in gold. OK that\'s a possibility you can actually buy 99.99% pure gold bullion coins from reputable online dealers and have it sent straight to your house. Unfortunately 1 gold coin is more than 1000 euros, so you cannot afford one.\n\n5. Silver. A decent investment if you ask me. You could buy 50 silver coins for 1000 euros (buy actual coins not ETF\'s or other "paper") and I expect silver to do well over the next 5 years.\n\n6. Bitcoin. To be honest, this is where I would put my money. Bitcoin\'s value is down just not but I consider that growing pains, and the potential upsides are enormous. At the end of the day, its a thousand euros. Its not pocket change, but its not going to change your life either, so if bitcoin went to zero its not like you\'d be homeless. If bitcoin works, then you\'ll have a lot more than a thousand euros worth. But please look into properly securing your bitcoins for long term holding before you charge in and buy them and then lose them because you don\'t know what you\'re doing.': 1, "Risky investments usually have the best returns, but a good chance to lose it all. If you pick right, you win big. If you lose, it could be all gone. That should be the expectation with risk anyway.\n\nSince you are young and have plenty of time to make up that $1000 if it disappears. And there is a reasonable chance bitcoin can rise in magnitudes of value in the next decade - way way way better than any traditional investment. \n\nStudy why the blockchain works. Investigate alternatives. Listen to everyone's opinion and build your own confidence and sense of direction where this technology is headed. Stuff like this only comes around every few decades so make the most of it.": 1, 'True true :)': 1, 'As a youth, you should consider riskier investments like bitcoin while you are young, and transition to more conservative investments as you get older. The upside of bitcoin is ridiculous at this moment in history. The downsides are relatively minimal to you.': 4, "It has happened before, and I doubt Bitcoin will die like this lol; now its value is low I can buy more for less, and it's more probable it will go up than down right?

Good luck!": 3, "I like the first.. The second not sure how it works..

I think it's far less likely that his parents are willing to give their 16 year old son their last 1000\xe2\x82\xac and tell him to roll the dice.": 1, "Well, I'd say invest in Euros but you've already got them...": 2, 'Just putting the money I have in a bank account and wait is a really bad idea here, some are corrupt and others are going to bankrupt. \n\nSad country I live in..

I'm the one telling my parents and not to waste money, usually it's the opposite...\n\nEdit: but I agree with 1000\xe2\x82\xac is nothing, if I lose it I'll still be able to sleep at night\n\nSo should I go for risk investments?": 1, 'https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzctEq7iZD-7-DgJM604zsndMapn9ff6q': 1, 'Everyone here has an opinion, but nobody knows.\n\n': 1, "> As a youth, you should consider riskier investments\n\nThis notion seems to be ignored, but it's spot on.": 2, 'I don\'t know exactly how individual companies will fare. My guess is Coca-Cold and McDonalds will still be around.\n\nMy guess is that the next crash will actually begin with a sovereign debt crisis. National governments are at the point now where they have so much debt they simply cannot pay it back its impossible it doesn\'t matter how high they make taxes. The US government takes in about 3.5 trillion and its debt is now over 18 trillion and growing. That\'s like earning $50,000 euros a year and having a credit card debt of $250,000 + interest.\n\nSo I think they\'re going to do QE. America did QE so I think they are going to be doing QE4 (or QE4ever as I like to call it) the Eurozone are starting their QE program as well. QE is just their fancy term for print a whole lot of money and use that to pay back your debt. For everyone else that\'s called "counterfeiting" and you go to jail for them that\'s "sound fiscal policy".\n\nI don\'t know if you know what inflation actually is its when the government prints more money the money becomes worth less because its being diluted. 3000 euros might buy you a 2nd hand car then you find 2 years later 3000 euros buys you a rubbish TV. Its not that everything else got more expensive its that the money became worth less.\n\nI\'ve actually got a Zimbabwe dollar note its a 100 TRILLION dollar note. Its absolutely worthless. I bought it as a collectable for 3 pounds. That\'s what happened to Zimbabwe they\'re currency went into insane inflation so 1 Zimbabwe dollar would buy you a loaf of bread, and then a year later a billion Zimbabwe dollars would buy you 1 loaf of bread, then a year after that 100 trillion would not buy you a loaf of bread then they just gave up and scrapped the currency.\n\nNow the European Central Bank is doing the same thing (on purpose!) with the Euro. I don\'t think it will hit crazy Zimbabwe money billion euros to buy a coffee style inflation, but they are deliberately trying to cause SOME inflation. So yeah gold or silver (honestly I\'d go for silver) would be a good bet because when inflation hits that\'s when people run to safe havens which are assets that cannot be printed at will like gold and silver.': 1, 'what? the Euro is tanking.': 0, "I find the best way to track the state of the economy is to keep up with the news. Keep up with the podcasts from the pundits like Mike Maloney and Peter Schiff these are the guys who predicted the 2008 crash and they're saying right now we are in another bubble about to head into the next crash.\n\nThat's kind of my strategy I'm betting against national currencies. The stock market, the S&P 500, index funds blah blah blah all of this stuff is tied to the health of the currency itself. If the dollar goes, bye bye stock market. Same with the euro and the UK pound and the Chinese Yuan. I'm betting against them by putting my money into....anything else. \n\nFor me that's gold (I don't own much at all), silver (I own some) and bitcoins where I have most of my investments. That's it that's my 3 investments because I think there is going to be a massive crash and soon (wouldn't surprise me if happens this year, and I'd be very surprised if it doesn't happen within 2 years) and the entire economy is going to implode. At that point dislocated money is going to be looking for a safe haven which is traditionally gold, silver and my hope is bitcoin will be a new option.\n\nWhen government issued money goes down the toilet, people are going to look for alternatives which is gold, silver and bitcoin.

Never "invest" too much in 1 asset unless it\'s risk money or for fun.\n\nMaybe, if you really understand what Bitcoin is, you could buy 100 euros of bitcoins.
