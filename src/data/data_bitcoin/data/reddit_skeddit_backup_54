Something bad on the cards?  You detected a hardfork starting?  \nHere you borrow some bitcoin from someone, sell it, keep the fiat currency for a while (like days) and purchase the bitcoin back later to return to who you borrowed from.  \n\n\nGoing long.  When you think bitcoin is going up you hold it.  Pretty much what everyone does to begin with or those who believe bitcoin has bigger potential uses than what it currently is used for.\n\n\nVolatility.  You can leverage any movement.  Not sure how to explain this other than you borrow money from someone to do a massive amount of going long or short in a small window of time.  \nIf however bitcoin price goes up or down too much against you, your margin gets called automatically to settle your debt on the loan you owe and you lose all your money.  You make a lovely stream of money in the short term as the price bounces around within a window and all is peachy... when it does go wrong (and it will) you lose everything.\n  \n\nArbitrage.  Find a place that you can buy bitcoin for price X and somewhere that you can sell your bitcoin for (X+extra). Using this and leverage you can make money from small price differences when greater than the exchange fees.\nTwo exchanges regularly have this in times of large price movements.  Typically the part here that is slow is banking system.  You'll find you can move bitcoin almost instantly however getting the fiat back out from the exchange followed by banking system takes DAYS, perhaps longer when talking foreign currencies and volatility in forex prices & fees.  So whilst you may see a lovely 4% spread to earn cash out of and think you're about to be a millionaire, the archaic banking system prevents this to happen because it's so slow and shyte which is why the spread exists at all.\n\n\nA note however, decentralised exchanges may really mess this up for the banks.  If they work successfully they may allow fiat arbitrage to be in minutes thereby making bitcoin a stronger currency than fiats.  Will be interesting to watch what happens when people discover this.\n\n\nOne thing to note about forex, it's NOT regulated as it's an OverTheCounter (OTC) asset meaning anyone can trade it.  It is the wild west regardless to what the tabloids say.  Banks simply pluck a figure out of the air as the exchange rate.  They can't be too wild as there is competition and arbitrage prevents this but when big banks are the main source of forex trading there is nothing to stop them colluding and say picking a time when the exchange rate will be set yet they have prior knowledge of what it will be set to so take their long/short position respectively.

I don\'t want to oversell BitCoin. As we scale up there will be bumps along the way. I\'m confident of it. Why? For example, as the volume of transactions come up--right now, I can run BitCoin on my personal computer and communicate over my DSL line; and I get every single transaction that\'s happening everywhere in the world. As we scale up, that won\'t be possible any more. If there are millions of bitcoin transactions happening every second, that will be a great problem for BitCoin to have--means it is very popular, very trusted--but obviously I won\'t be able to run it on my own personal computer. **It will take dedicated fleets of computers with high-speed network interfaces, and that kind of big iron to actually do all that transaction processing**. I\'m confident that will happen and that will evolve. But right now all the people trying to generate bitcoins on their own computers and who like the fact that they can be a self-contained unit, I think they may not be so happy if BitCoin gets really big and they can no longer do that.\n\n.\n\n> but I think you don\'t need a cluster for 32Mb blocks anyway\n\nAccording to the btcd team which actually tested blocks of that size, [*you do*](https://blog.conformal.com/btcsim-simulating-the-rise-of-bitcoin/).\n\n> After simulating the creation of blocks up to 32 MB in size, we have arrived at some interesting conclusions:\n\n- a 32 MB block, when filled with simple P2PKH transactions, can hold approximately 167,000 transactions, which, assuming a block is mined every 10 minutes, translates to approximately 270 tps\n- a single machine acting as a full node takes approximately 10 minutes to verify and process a 32 MB block, meaning that a 32 MB block size is near the maximum one could expect to handle with 1 machine acting as a full node\n- a CPU profile of the time spent processing a 32 MB block by a full node is dominated by ECDSA signature verification, meaning that with the current infrastructure and computer hardware, scaling above 300 tps would require a clustered full node where ECDSA signature checking is load balanced across multiple machines.\n\n> Aside from the obvious network and storage constraints of running a full Bitcoin node at large block sizes, it appears the Bitcoin network is capable of handling a substantially higher transaction volume than it does currently. The CPU time being dominated by ECDSA signature checks at high transaction rates suggests a clustered full node architecture could process credit-card-like transaction rates by using a load balancing / offload approach to ECDSA signature checking, e.g. a full node with a 10 machine cluster would top out at >2,000 tps.\n>\n> The resources and know-how required to run a clustered node like this may impose a significant centralizing force on Bitcoin. Backpressure against the centralization of Bitcoin may well drive alternative solutions to having all transactions on-chain. Alternatively, it may end up that Bitcoin adoption grows slowly enough that the computing power of a single node grows quickly enough to avoid requiring a clustered full node architecture.\n\n.\n\n> then [32MB blocks] will be just fine in a few years\n\n32MB blocks isn\'t even 10% of VISA\'s daily average throughput.

We are also unique in being over-reserved. As of 10am today PST, our reserve was currently worth $5,440M in US dollars and obligations to our members stood at $5,383M. Any way you choose to look at it, it\xe2\x80\x99s still a fact that we have over 101% tier one capital. Compare that to a legacy bank which has (for the most part) only about 10%. In addition, our business and operating accounts are legally segmented and segregated from our customer accounts. These accounts are independently audited on a quarterly basis by an independent 3rd party.\n\nIf you have some notions about how capital, FX, trading and liquidity works, this should all make good business sense, and you\xe2\x80\x99ll probably also get why it allows us to offer the best prices in the market. Also, good note from @krazyest below, pointing at our *stoploss*. Out of coincidence, the Bitcoin price has risen today and you can see how our custom algorithms predicted and protected our reserve.

We need a detailed comparison of building software by traditional methods vs building it using your technology.\n\nJust to clarify, we are claiming that this technology has the *potential* to surpass current methods (in terms of both productivity of the design process itself and the efficiency of the resulting product, the program). On the very front page of our site we state that "It will take some time before the network becomes profitable, before it can compete with current methods."\n\nThe main reason this type of development process has the *potential* to surpass existing methods is this;\nAs long as current methods have to push parameters across a run-time interface, they can never truly approach optimal solutions. At some point, high in the levels of abstraction, a program can drown in its glue code. This process eliminates glue code altogether by pushing all of that contextual-dependency into design-time (the point at which a build goes through). This is what allows this system to *scale* so beautifully, and allows it to (still theoretically, at present) approach optimal software solutions (and at the same time, protect the IP of each developer). \n\n> You provide some evidence that your technology works at all. That\'s cute.\n\nCute? It\'s not vapourware...\n\n> Did you know that a web server can be built in 280 lines of bash code?\n\nOf course. Does that 280-line web server have front-end executable content?

That doesn\'t mean that Brainfuck is a good programming language.\n\nYour choice of programming language leaves much to be desired, but you make a valid point.

And each of the vendors who translate those specifications into lower-level specifications were *extensively vetted* by their own developer-owner before being deployed. In this way, "buggy corner cases" are checked for at every single level of abstraction, cumulatively, *prior* to a build taking place. \n\nA needle in a haystack is not so hard to find when every straw is manned. \n\n> Successful mechanization of the software production process (and compensating people for it) is not the real problem, the entire issue is that specifying what you want your program to do requires as much detail as the actual writing of the code.\n\nYou\'re right in that the monetisation scheme was not the dealbreaker for this technology.
