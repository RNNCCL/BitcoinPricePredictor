We (those interested in the strength and success of Bitcoin) want people to WANT to run a node, rather than merely 'have no problem' with doing so.\n\nA lot of effort is focused on the incentives of miners (for good reason).

But this didn't last very long though and it wasn't intended as a way to keep nodes on the network. \n\n\n> These are potentially silly examples to illustrate my point, but I feel that seemingly frivolous features could actually drive significant interest and involvement in the network.\n\nI'm a game developer and I know full well that eye candy sells. :) But the requirements for running a full node are only getting higher. Right now, I'm not even comfortable running one on my 250GB capped internet connection, although I think there is talk of adding throttling controls to a later version (not sure when that'll go in though), which would make it more manageable for people with capped internet connections.\n\nI think that's actually the biggest issue right now.

As in most bubbles, the exponential rally stopped suddenly because the demand responsible for it saturated.  As in most bubbles, there was a crash after the peak, as speculators who bought during the rally dumped as fast as they could.\n\nUnlike most other previous or later bubbles, however, the 2011 one did not settle at a stable value determined by that saturated demand (which may have been somewhere between 10$ and 15$).  Instead, the bubble "deflated" almost completely over the year, as if that demand was evaporating and the people in that particular market were slowly selling their coins. \n\nThe price had reached 2.2$ by Nov/2013 when another bubble started and left the price at 5$.  This new bubble did have a lasting effect, which provided the floor for the next bubble in early 2013.\n\nWithout the 2012 bubble, it looks like the price would have returned at the pre-bubble level (under 1$).\n\nThe Nov/2013 bubble, that peaked at ~1200$, looks like a repeat of the 2011 bubble: instead of defining a new plateau, it seems that the demand that drove it is slowly evaporating.  That demand was the Chinese market, and the PBoC decrees have reduced it to a gambling game played by day-traders within the exchanges.  Since it is a zero-sum game, at best, many of those speculators must be losing money.  So it is not surprising that those speculators are gradually leaving the market.\n\nThere was a smaller bubble in June/2014, which may have left a lasting +200$ gain.  So, even if that Chinese demand disappears, the price will not return to the pre-bubble level (~130$). Perhaps the price is now near the bottom.   \n\nThe question is whether there will be another bubble as big as the Nov/2013.  It would have to be a market larger than the Chinese one.

But one thing is for sure, if the price tanks, arbitrage will equalize volatility across exchanges. What I mean is, it would be difficult to rinse and repeat huge sell order on many different exchanges. If you do it all at once, yes then at least the market orders would probably go through.\n\nSo what you must do is to check the order books of all the major exchanges that you can see yourself using. Then check how big the spread would be. That way you can get some idea of how much coins can be bought and sold, for what spread.\n\nNow, the important thing here is to time the market. When price is going down, liquidity will evaporate. What you want to do is to liquidate a lot of coins when price is going up, because then there is the most liquidity and the least spread. Market orders in this type of environment can certainly work.\n\nWhat I\'m getting at here is that it is not enough to check the order book, you will also have to take the market conditions into account.\n\nIf you\'re not sure of how to make sense of the market conditions, then just ask me for help. Though I don\'t have a crystal ball, I\'m pretty lucky.\n\nEDIT: I just re-read the last comment you made about your fears of Venezuela at the edge of bankruptcy. So, if people in Venezuela would start buying bitcoins like mad right now, I think the price would sky rocket. Traders would see this as an opportunity to take advantage of leveraged short positions, that would run the risk of being forced liquidated by sky rocketing prices. The market in general would take notice and start buying to. In current market conditions, this would mark the end of a long bear market and the price having bottomed out. As the price rises, the spread wouldn\'t be to bad, because the rising price would compensate for this. Now, if you have bought tons and tons of bitcoins and want to cash out, this would be an excellent time to do so, because of the strong bid in the market. Well... if you\'re Satoshi or have an equivalent amount of coins, you would still have to be _very_ gentle (just the fact that Satoshis coins are "tainted" in the sense that everyone knows its his, would scare people as soon as the tx hits the wire. Satoshi would have to sell his coins at localbitcoins to avoid this (yes its a bad joke) ). If you\'re selling enough, you would have to do it gradually over time and probably sell into strength. \n\nEDIT 2: If you are the only Venezuelas buying like crazy, but no-one else, then yes you would run into some problems. Probably what I would do is to distribute the money and buying also things like NuBits (https://nubits.com/), peercoins, litecoins and of course buy bitcoins and use Coinapult to lock some value to dollars, silver and what not. That way you would be pretty diversified.  Now, if the market start tanking real hard, the money you\'ve got in peercoins would drop as well, along with bitcoins. So, what you can do is to open up accounts at one or more of those risky exchanges and short the price of bitcoins and peercoins etc. Should the price drop hard, this hedge will protect you a little - especially if its a leveraged trade. The good thing about leverage, is that while your exposure to volatility _increases_ your exposure to  exchange default risk (which historically speaking is very high) _decreases_. What I would do is to take these kinds of different positions, to distribute risk all over the ecosystem. That way you would be protected somewhat from the spread. You would have to seriously know what you were doing though, because the odds is that this kind of strategy would blow up in your face.

This is not meant to discourage you, just a word of caution. I speak from experience (in terms of risking a lot more than I originally intended to). \n\nAlso, just remember, there are fees for every trade, so in reality if you are breaking even on a trade, you are really losing. Take this into account. Also, in terms of picking the trades correctly in your head--just know in practice it is sometimes harder to execute than you would imagine. If you are not quick enough to the trigger (since the market is so illiquid at this point in time) volatility and slippage can cost you. The market can move very fast on you, and just a tad of indecision can cost you a lot, as you will end up selling at the bottom of a movement or buying at the top. \n\n**Disclosure: I know nothing about trading, but these are some things I overlooked when first considering it.**\n": 3}, ('@YESConnie ~ Self-Control (Audio) with Bitcoin Wallet', 4): {}, ('HYIP/PONZI site has control over 134K Bitcoins ?!', 1): {'Have opened a ticket twice on their zendesk and both tickets have been closed without comment. \npathetic.': 1, 'How would that be possible when: "Please sign the following message from the address you are tagging " ?': 1, 'It also allows tagging by putting the address on a web site and not needing to sign anything.

Hardware Backdoor's are real and more prevalent than you can imagine. The only way to be sure you aren't susceptible is to design and build your own CPU and computer system. Fabricating your own silicon chips is a surprisingly simple process, as all you really need is some sand.\n\n * Once you've hand manufactured your CPU, Motherboard, RAM, and IO devices, you'll need to write a C compiler that will compile down to your CPU's native language. Writing your own compiler will keep you safe from the Ken Thompson Hack.\n\n * Create a simple OS that you can use to access the internet. Some people might suggest using Linux, but there are 9,868,933 lines of code in just the Kernel, most of which you won't need, and personally verifying every line for rootkits might take a bit longer than you have the patience for.\n\n * Create your own bitcoin client. Satoshi's client could possess hidden back doors, or they could have been introduced since his departure. The classic create-a-currency-to-compromise-a-users-computer-attack is devastating, and we can't rule Satoshi out. Bottom line is that you cannot be sure.\n\n * Dig a very deep hole into the earth, and surround it with at least three feet of re-enforced concrete. Place your custom PC in there.

This is totally irrelevant of course, because it\'s not about the value of one unit but rather the value of all the units combined.  This is commonly known as the "market cap" (which many will argue isn\'t a true measure of a cryptocurrency\'s overall value, but it\'s a good start).\n\nSo really what you mean to ask is, "What puts bitcoin on top with its $5 billion market cap?"\n\nInterestingly, this question was asked a lot in the early days as a concern for whether bitcoin could ever really take off.  Many argued that if bitcoin\'s market cap rose into the $10\'s and $100\'s of millions, ... then people would simply turn to cheaper coins rather than the pricey bitcoin.  Thus the cryptocurrency market would saturate, and none of them would ever really reach any significant value itself.\n\nThis proved to be wrong, at least to some degree as we saw the cryptocurrency market grow exponentially and bitcoin maintain a sizable lead.  As far as why this is the case, we can only theorize.  The common belief has to do with the network effect, where as a network (such as bitcoin) grows bigger, it becomes the most enticing place cryptocurrency users to flock.\n\n(Think facebook:  Everyone is on facebook.  This makes it valuable to an individual user, because all their friends are on the site.  It has a strong network.  The strong network makes it appealing.  Since it\'s so appealing, everyone joins in.  Since everyone joins in, it such a strong network)\n\nYou can see it\'s kind of a cycle, where becoming the biggest network actually helps get more people in to make it even bigger.  This network effect has proven to be a stronger force than the other theories (people will want newer coins, cheaper coins, coins with different features).  The the value of the network effect to an individual user might not be obvious as first (why not just buy a cheaper coin?  they\'re all the same!), but it does in fact exist.  For one, the large network of bitcoin makes it much more secure due to all the computers simultaneously running the protocol software.  It\'s a big strange to think about, but all the individual users who are acting selfishly are collectively making a rock-solid network.
