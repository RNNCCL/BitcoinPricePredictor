": 3, 'Central Bankers Explore Response to Bitcoin: Their Own Digital Cash\n\nTransformation could cut costs while raising security concerns\n\nBy RYAN TRACY\n\nUpdated Dec. 9, 2015 7:10 p.m. ET\n\nThe rise of bitcoin has central bankers around the world studying the possibility of issuing virtual money backed by the government itself.\n\nA shift in that direction could cut costs across the payment system and give authorities more control over their money supply. It also could\xe2\x80\x8braise security and privacy concerns.\n\nTo date, no central banks have embraced issuing digital versions of their fiat currencies. But the prospect is gaining steam as officials around the world begin to view a mostly digital payment system as inevitable.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe have to envision a world in which people mostly use e-money,\xe2\x80\x9d Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, said in a Nov. 13 speech. \xe2\x80\x9cWe need to anticipate this and manage the risks and benefits that could arise.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo far, central banks haven\xe2\x80\x99t settled on a technology that would allow them to issue their own digital cash. But a Dublin-based startup, eCurrency Mint, has been meeting with central banks and marketing a technology that it claims would give them that capacity.\n\nJonathan Dharmapalan, founder and chief executive of eCM, said the firm has discussed the technology with 30 central banks, piloted it \xe2\x80\x9cin multiple countries,\xe2\x80\x9d and reached agreements with two central banks to transfer to them the technology necessary to issue the currency. He declined to say which central banks or countries but said he expects them to announce the programs publicly soon.\n\nHe said that, unlike bitcoin, his technology isn\xe2\x80\x99t designed to operate as its own payment system outside the existing one. Instead, it could be transferred just like cash between consumers, merchants, banks and payment companies, using existing digital transaction systems or new ones. In other words, it would change the makeup of the currency without changing the \xe2\x80\x9cpipes\xe2\x80\x9d through which it flows.\n\nIn recent years, Canada and Ecuador have experimented with their own digital payment technologies, and the topic is on the research agendas of central banks across the world. The Bank for International Settlements, the members of which include 60 global central banks, said in a paper last month that existing digital currencies such as bitcoin raise the possibility authorities will have less control over the monetary system\xe2\x80\x94and \xe2\x80\x9cone option is to consider using the technology itself to issue digital currencies.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\n\n\nOfficials at the U.S. Federal Reserve say they are monitoring developments but haven\xe2\x80\x99t said they are considering issuing digital currency.\n\nCentral bankers\xe2\x80\x99 interest in digital currency is an inevitable reaction to the rapid shift away from physical cash. The existing payment system is electronic, but money is stored centrally in bank accounts and verified via payment networks, which add cost along the way.\n\nA digital currency, on the other hand, would be like a bit of encrypted computer code \xe2\x80\x9cminted\xe2\x80\x9d by a central bank. It would carry with it all the necessary information to validate its value. That means in a sense it could move around with users and merchants.\n\n\xe2\x80\x8bFor instance, today a consumer might hold $10 of digital cash on a debit or gift card issued by a bank or a retailer. That $10 can only be spent where the card is accepted. But if that card held $10 in digital currency backed by the U.S. Federal Reserve, its owner could, in theory, spend it anywhere.\n\nThe prospect is appealing to central bankers for a litany of reasons. On a practical level, they could save money on printing physical cash. Mr. Dharmapalan says minting and distributing digital currency would cost 10% of what it costs to print and distribute an equivalent physical currency note while allowing the government to retain the revenue it gets from issuing currency, known as seigniorage.\n\nCentral bankers also might find appealing the ability to better track transactions, since cash transactions are anonymous and susceptible to illicit uses.\n\nIn a news release Wednesday, the Omidyar Network, a philanthropic investment firm backed by eBay Inc. founder Pierre Omidyar, said it had invested in eCM. The company and the investment firm, which haven\xe2\x80\x99t previously spoken to the media about their digital currency project, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t say how much money eCM has raised since it was founded in 2011.\n\nFelix Martin, an investment fund manager and author of the book \xe2\x80\x9cMoney: The Unauthorised Biography,\xe2\x80\x9d said he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t evaluated eCM\xe2\x80\x99s technology in detail, but in theory such an innovation \xe2\x80\x9ccould be a very useful technological advance, most likely as something to sit alongside physical cash\xe2\x80\x9d that would allow nonbank firms to interact digitally with the central bank.\n\nKennedy Komba, who works at Tanzania\xe2\x80\x99s central bank and with the Alliance for Financial Inclusion, a global network of financial policy makers, said he had met with eCM, and that he thinks the prospect of central bank-backed digital cash has \xe2\x80\x9ca lot of potential.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIn Africa, for instance, where mobile-phone payments have grown rapidly, physical money backed by the government is still crucial, says Mr. Komba. If a mobile-phone customer in Tanzania wants to put money in her account, he or she often must deposit cash. If that same consumer wanted to make a payment to another person who didn\xe2\x80\x99t have the same phone company, he or she would have to withdraw cash.\n\nTo facilitate all that cash movement, the central bank, commercial banks and phone companies must spend money on employees, vaults and secure transportation. A digital currency could reduce those costs by making transactions simpler and easier to execute, and that could lower the cost of financial services more generally.\n\nIn developed countries such as the U.S., digital cash could also have benefits for consumers by allowing money to move more easily and cheaply in the digital realm.\n\nEconomists such as Andrew Haldane, the chief economist of the Bank of England, have said widespread use of digital cash could create new possibilities in interest-rate policy at a time when existing monetary policy tools are being pushed to their limits to boost the global economy.\n\nPolicy makers have generally avoided negative interest rates, in part because consumers would withdraw their physical cash from banks if they felt the negative rate would diminish their account value. If there were no physical cash, account holders wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have that option.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps central bank money is ripe for its own great technological leap forward,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Haldane said in a Sept. 18 speech.': 1}, ('My thoughts on the speculation around finding Satoshi', 3): {'But who is John Galt?': 1}, ("What's the difference between bitcoins and the publicly traded Bitcoin (btcs)", 0): {'I think the ratio is close but not exactly equal to 1:10.
