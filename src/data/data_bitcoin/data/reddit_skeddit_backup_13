As the network sees both of these, both chains are kept by nodes, but ultimately the "longest chain" will prevail as the correct chain.  The blocks found on the "losing" chain become invalid to all of the nodes (i.e. "orphaned").  The orphaned blocks could be either the first found or the last, the winning factor is simply which chain is longest.\n\nOf course, as soon as a miner learns of a new block, they quit searching to solve that block.

The coinbase transaction allows the winning miner to assign the reward amount (currently 25BTC) to one or more addresses of their choice.

The network will naturally resolve these forks by selecting the longest chain to build on.\n\nIn addition to the block reward, the miner can claim mining fees through the block reward.

As block rewards half toward zero, mining fees will be the primary incentive for miners to continue processing transactions and mining blocks.": 2, 'Only problem is that a block will _never_ contain a million transaction at the current blocksize limit and transaction already cost more than a penny (a penny per tx is too much already). \n\nI paid .000025 btc fee yesterday for few days old bitcoin when block were being filled at 600kb and I took five blocks before it was put in a block. \n\nScalability is a major problem right now, especially with the halving coming).

Often fingerprints take the form of hashes of cryptographic keys. For example, an SSH server fingerprint is a hash of an SSH server\'s public key, and a PGP fingerprint is a hash of a PGP public key.

Bitcoin is a decentralised network. What Bitcoin (capital "B") is, is a *protocol*. Its a rulebook. Its a set of instructions for a computer on how to maintain consensus with n number of other computers. There is no one in charge, just a bunch of computers that, by running the bitcoin protocol, all agree to be bound by the same rules.\n\nBitcoins are minted by a process called "mining". Which is solving a mathematical puzzle that takes about 10 minutes to solve. The miner that solves the puzzle wins the next batch of bitcoins (currently 25 a pop).\n\nNo one actually issues these bitcoins its just an agreed upon rule that the winning miner gets that reward. Its also a preprogrammed rule that at block 440,000, that reward drops to 12.5 coins.\n\nThat\'s why miners mine but the side effect of that is network security. The only way to "hijack" the network, is to out-mine all of the other miners...combined. That would be difficult to say the least.\n\nThere\'s about 15.5 million coins in circulation just now, and its counting up to 21 million, but the count halves every 4 years so its actually going to take about another 125 years to hit the final 21 million mark.\n\nSo rather than command/control, it is *consensus*.

Mining makes the network secure but miners need a reason to mine and right now fees are not enough to be economical.  The idea is as the network grows fees become worth more  (1 penny per transaction really adds up if 1 block contains 10 million transactions) and the block reward becomes less relevant as it shrinks and eventually stops. The block reward is there to help bitcoin through its early years until the network is at a level of processing a few million transactions a minute.': 3, "Computers can create fingerprints for data. \n\nFingerprints are numbers computed from the file's binary (1's and 0's).\n\nAll data has a different fingerprint.\n\nBitcoin provides rules for Bitcoin's data.\n\nIf a miner can find a fingerprint that follows Bitcoin's rules and the fingerprint is a number within a target range (Also part of Bitcoin's rules) the miner is permitted to give themselves some Bitcoin using a specific transaction, a coinbase.": -1, 'have some here from me:\n\n/u/changetip 1 duck\n\n(sorry wong moinker in the first place)': 0, "Great explanation.

The software looks at the timestamps from the current adjustment block (a block whose number is an exact multiple of 2016), and the previous one.  The "difficulty" is adjusted by how much the actual time differs from the nominal time of 14 days.  In short, it is adjusted by how much the two-week average differs from 10 minutes per block.\n\nThe actual puzzle is "find a block hash (a kind of checksum) whose value is below a target determined by the difficulty".  The block hash includes the actual transactions in the block, the hash of the *previous* block, and a random number (nonce) that the miner varies to get a low hash value.  The difficulty formula and hash target are set so the *whole network* of miners find a good value once per 10 minutes.\n\nThe hash is calculated from the contents of the block, so if anyone tries to change the data (adding or changing a transaction), the hash will no longer match.  Since the hash is saved in the next block, you can\'t just change something in one block.  You have to update the next block too, and every one after it.  Otherwise, there will be a mismatch somewhere in the chain of blocks, and the software will notice.': 4, 'No that\'s not true.  The developers have complete control over the code and the miners have complete control over what code they choose to run.  There is no contract here, except an implied social contract and one which has proven to be exceptionally flexible so far.  No reason they can\'t just bump the limit or skip a halving if they wanted to.  Just like there is no reason they couldn\'t change the blocksize to any value they want, or remove it entirely, or switch the algorithm from SHA256 to something else, or change the method of signature encoding or not even verify blocks in the race to build new blocks, or bump the block finding rate to 1 min.  All of these parameters were designed by Satoshi to be replaceable if needs be. Nearly all of these altcoins you see are very thin forks of bitcoin with their own tweaks to parameters and some new graphics.\n\nSo let\'s be honest with ourselves.  If core, classic, unlimited, or anyone else for that matter wanted to make a major change and make it "official", all it would take is convincing 51% of the hashing power to support the new version.  You\'re talking about a rather smallish bribe to a single chinese official, since well over 75% of the hash power is sitting in China now days.  That official could simply call up the companies on this list and say "this is what you run now" and that is what they would be forced to run.\nhttps://blockchain.info/pools?show_adv=no\n\nAnother danger is that same official just calling these companies up and telling them to shut it down now.\nThat would break bitcoin severely.\n\nBitcoin has become HUGELY centralized and that centralization is mostly in China.

Those of us who have old hardware, high electricity prices, or both will have to shut down our operations. Those of us who have hardware with modifiable clockspeeds and voltages (e.g. Spondoolies hardware) will lower them in order to improve efficiency. This all will reduce the network hashrate.\n\nAs the network hashrate drops, the mining difficulty will drop as well (with a 2016 block, ~2 week delay). This improves the revenue and profitability for the miners who remain operating. Some equilibrium will eventually be reached, with a mining difficulty that's between 0% and 50% lower than the pre-halving difficulty. It's anyone's guess what that difficulty reduction will be. Mine is about 20%.\n\nWhile the difficulty is adjusting, block times will be slower than normal. Instead of one block every 10 minutes on average, we might see one block every 12 or 15 minutes. This will make block congestion worse. In turn, this should increase transaction fees. In theory, this could help encourage miners to keep mining; however, in practice, the size of this effect will be insignificant, as the transaction fees per block will likely only increase from about 0.2 of 25.2 BTC per block to about 0.5 of 13.0 BTC per block, or from about 1% to 4% of the total block reward.": 2, "I think some will turn half their machines off (half the electricity cost) and turn them on as the price goes up if it does indeed go up.

Miners have an interest in having Bitcoin survive, due to the fact that their hardware serves no other purpose. Also, a lot of miners (especially in China) are locked into long-term power contracts which they have to pay regardless of whether they use the power.\n\nOverall, though, I expect relatively few miners to stop mining during this halving because overall, miner profit margins are still relatively fat. The 2020 halving may be difficult, but I expect this one will not be.': 3, 'They will earn less bitcoin and spend the same amount of electricity.

The upside to #5 is that it reduces the likelihood of a dramatic hash-rate reduction.\n\nKeep in mind that miners are, by definition, playing a very long game, and most have been playing it for a long time. While the block reward is the short-term prize I believe most miners are focused on the long-game prize of "owning" a significant portion of the future stream of transaction processing fees.\n\nVisa, et. al. have shown that raking a portion of each transaction is a fantastic business model. Bitcoin will no-doubt lower the margin, but by 2024 or so being a significant miner could easily provide a low-stress, continuous profit stream for many decades to come.': 2, "And the increased transaction backlogs resulting from the longer block interval will incite another panic that will crash the price, forcing even more miners out of business, thereby further depressing the hash rate and further extending the block interval and further increasing the backlog and further fueling the panic.

It\'s likely that your whole 1000 BTC is in a single output, and it\'s not possible to spend just part of an output.\n\nMost wallets will create a \'change\' output to a new address, but when spending from a paper wallet it\'s not clear what it will do with the change. I would recommend experimenting with small paper wallets to see exactly what BreadWallet does with the change when spending from a paper wallet.\n\nIt is not really a good idea to send the change back to the address it "came from" because that private key is no longer "cold".': 4, 'Nope, Bitcoin is not a concept, is just bitcoins, tokens, keys, math, crypto.

Sooner or later you will make a mistake and lose bitcoins.\n\nThe big problem is that when you transfer $400 from a paper wallet that held $1000, there is no guarantee that $600 still remains there. This is very surprising if you aren\'t used to how bitcoins work. A paper wallet doesn\'t necessarily act like a real wallet. Removing $400 from a paper wallet might leave the paper wallet with $0 in it, and the other $600 ends up somewhere else and you might not realize it. And you mislay that "somewhere else" and your $600 is now lost forever.\n\nA good secure device (like a spare Android phone which I recommended earlier), along with backups of your seed, will be much safer in practice.\n\nThe only good way of using a paper wallet is to give one as a gift, and then help the recipient move **all** the bitcoins out of the paper wallet into a device as soon as possible.\n\nIt\'s different if you are truly a pro and understand how paper wallets work. But even in that case, you would be better off using one or more hardware wallets, or using multisignature addresses and keeping the keys on multiple devices, in place of using paper wallets.': 3, "The private key is no longer 'cold' after you scan it with a device which is probably connected to the internet. I would never use a paper wallet again after it has been scanned.

I don't think so...": 2, "I would say you'd rather store your btcs by dividing them into separate paper wallets, because so you can withdraw one each time and the others remain cold wallets.

You would expect 8 bitcoins to remain in box A.\n\nThe complication is that some wallet software will take all 10 bitcoins out of box A, send 2 to your friend, then create a **brand new box B** and put the remaining 8 bitcoins in box B.\n\nSo now you think box A contains 8 bitcoins, and you don\'t realize there\'s a brand new box B in your desk drawer with the 8 bitcoins. You carefully keep box A (which is empty).\n\nYour desk is very old, so you take it to a recycling center, where they melt it down.\n\nYou think your 8 bitcoins are safe in box A. But they have been melted along with box B which was inside the desk drawer.\n\nWhy do some bitcoin wallets do this? They generate a new bitcoin address every time they send bitcoins, and all the unsent bitcoins go there, to enhance your privacy. Even though all the bitcoin transactions are publicly visible, generating a new so-called "change address" every time helps prevent nosy people from looking at the public blockchain and tracking who owns which bitcoins.\n\nThe cost of this privacy is more user confusion.\n\nThe new solution to this confusion is deterministic wallets. No matter how many addresses they generate, you only ever need the original seed to recover all your bitcoins. But isolated private keys don\'t fit in this scheme, which is why you try to get your bitcoins out of any isolated private key (or paper wallet) and into a deterministic wallet as soon as possible.\n\nOnce they are in a deterministic wallet, you can recycle your desk safely. It doesn\'t matter if the bitcoins were in box A or box B. Both boxes can be recreated at any time from your wallet seed, and the bitcoins recovered.': 2, "Here is one strategy.\n\nGet a secondary SIM-less Android phone, running Android 5.x or 6.x. Pick a smaller screen size, and get one used (maybe off Ebay or Craigslist) to keep the price down. It doesn't need to have much memory or disk space. Factory-reset it, do not root it, and enable full-disk encryption if not already active. Set a very long unlock key (e.g., 16-digit PIN), and make sure you set it so it requires the unlock key to start booting.\n\nThis secondary Android phone has no SIM. You will only ever use Wi-Fi.\n\nUninstall or disable all the apps that you don't need to use bitcoins.\n\nInstall selected bitcoin wallets. Try Mycelium or Coinomi or both.\n\nInitialize the wallet and save your seed somewhere. Most people recommend a paper copy.\n\nIf you have a Chromebook, and ONLY if you have a Chromebook, you can create a free Lastpass account, install the Lastpass extension, and save your seed in a Secure Note within Lastpass. Do not use Lastpass on any other OS to save the seed. And do not use this Lastpass account for managing any non-bitcoin passwords.\n\nKeep most of your bitcoins funds in the wallet on your SIM-less secondary Android phone. Keep this phone powered off.\n\nSince your secondary SIM-less Android phone remains powered off most of the time, if anybody steals it, it will be impossible, or very hard, for them to break into it. You will have time to create a new wallet somewhere else and sweep the bitcoins out of the old wallet.\n\nYou will only ever power it up when using your own private Wi-Fi. Never in any public hotspot. Power it up, transfer enough bitcoins from it to your iPhone breadwallet or to any other device for whatever you need to do, then power it down.\n\nAbout once every couple of weeks, keep this Android phone powered up long enough so it can get any Android updates. **Don't let them autoinstall.** Install updates only after they have been out for a while. This way, if any update turns out to be bad, you will read about it before it gets a chance to infect your phone.": 1, 'BTW, if I have 50,000 bits in my wallet and I send someone 20,000, I\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely be left with 30,000.

If a8f3 has access to $5000 in the blockchain, and I use my mobile app (90dc) to scan the a8f3 and say "take $4999," then a8f3 only has access to $1 in the blockchain. Someone breaking in and stealing the a8f3 paper wallet is only getting $1.\n\nIs that not correct?': 1, "What's the security issue with having a single paper wallet?

If there are no bitcoins on your disk drive (which might hold a copy of the blockchain) then there are no bitcoins in the blockchain. If there are bitcoins on your disk drive, then how could the same bitcoins also be on all the other disk drives that also hold copies of the blockchain?\n\nI think it\'s perfectly fine to think of bitcoins as being "in" your wallet. It\'s just like saying you have $5K USD "in" your bank account, even though your bank account is just a row in some SQL database that holds mostly strings, integers, and fixed-point numbers.': 1, "> Well, you're basically saying BreadWallet is insecure\n\nYou're not only trusting BreadWallet itself, but the OS it runs under. The last I heard BreadWallet was only available on a proprietary closed source phone OS, and so you have to trust the vendor not to compromise your information, and you have to trust the OS itself not to have any security holes in it.\n\nI have no evidence that iOS is insecure, but I have no proof that it isn't, either.\n\nI would recommend splitting your coins between multiple paper wallets so that if you do happen to scan one of them into an insecure device at least you only lose that one wallet's balance.": 1, 'Is worst because you always go back to $$$$.

It lets you choose a passphrase, but only to protect your keys. So, to summarize:\n\n**If it requires you to reveal anything about yourself, it\'s not a proper bitcoin wallet.**\n\nYou can find out experimentally if a bitcoin wallet is deterministic or not. Install it afresh on device A and let it create your keys following its default initialization sequence. It should ask you to save a "seed", which is a sequence of 12 or more words.\n\nSend yourself a tiny amount (e.g., 0.1 mBTC) from some other device B into the wallet on device A. Save your seed then delete the wallet app from device A. Reinstall on device A, and initialize with the saved seed. If your 0.1 mBTC magically reappears, you have a deterministic wallet. Otherwise it\'s not, and you just lost 0.1 mBTC. Maybe you should have sent only 0.01 mBTC.\n\nPlease see my suggestions at this link: [d2w5wxa](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/4i6yd3/hypothetical_question_about_storing_large_amounts/d2w5wxa).\n\n(Edited to strike out assertion that the Blockchain wallet requires access to contacts.

Multiple paper wallets stored in different secure locations protect from this.\n\nThere are two additional issues with the paper wallet once the private key has been scanned. First, there is a chance that the private key has been intercepted and thus compromised.

With paper you eliminate any threat of software bugs, hacking, crypto weaknesses (except possibly how you generate a random key for paper; some people roll dice).

Your mobile phone may be totally safe and paper wallets have their own threat models (theft, fire, photo snapshots etc), but the two have different threat models.\n\nIf no one knows you have a paper wallet they are unlikley to force you to reveal it. If someone checks your phone and see a balance there is more likelihood they will beat it out of you.

I cannot explain to you in a quick summary why blockstream has a financial incentive to see *bitcoin* progress, you will have to study the industry and evaluate the information that took me years to understand.\n\nThe most important thing to remember is that bitcoin is a protocol, and blockstream is creating layers above the protocol. They have not, will not, and do not "cripple" it in any way. They enhance it.\n\n[Perhaps reading Adam Back\'s scaling roadmap](http://coinjournal.net/blockstream-president-adam-back-shares-roadmap-scaling-bitcoin/) will help you see the vision. I doubt it will though, as you seem to live in this fantasy world of black and white and dont seem to understand the complexity of the situation.\n\nPerhaps knowing [Adam Back is the creator of Hash-Cash, the proof of work system bitcoin is built upon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Back), will help you understand the level of brilliance this man has.\n\nPerhaps [Knowing he is a Cypherpunk, and even in their wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cypherpunk) and learning about the Cypherpunks will ease your insane conspiracy theorist agenda. Here is his entry in the Cypherpunk entry on wiki -\n\n>Civil disobedience[edit]\nCypherpunks encouraged civil disobedience, in particular US law on the export of cryptography. Until 1996, cryptographic code was legally a munition, and until 2000 export required a permit.\n\n>In 1995 Adam Back wrote a version of the RSA algorithm for public-key cryptography in three lines of Perl[33][34] and suggested people use it as an email signature file.\n\nI cannot change your mind with a few words. But you obviously have a *lot* of learning to do and you are too hasty to draw lines in the sand when you clearly have a limited understanding of the nature of sand, or lines.\n\nGood luck to you, I hope you choose education and research over conspiracy theories and allegations. There are few people I can think of less suited to run bitcoin than Adam Back.
