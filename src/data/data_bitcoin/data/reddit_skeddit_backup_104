So I think this is the less likely result.\n\nThe more likely scenario is that the minority chain would simply change the PoW algo and continue on. There would probably be enough people willing to stay the course and continue. \n\nBut even if the minority chain dies as you predict, that doesn't invalidate my question at all. If there are a large amount of BTC that will be sold off on the new chain, that's surely an issue. You may not believe me, but I can pretty much guarantee that there are people holding lots of BTC that view a hard fork like this a 'game over' situation for Bitcoin, and thus will liquidate their holdings on the new fork. \n\nWhich is why I posed the additional question at the end of how much BTC would it take for people to consider that their decision may not be an economically rational one. \n\nMaybe it would be better if I posed the question as something like 'what is the lowest price of BTC you would agree to if you had foreknowledge of the economic result of the hard fork?'. That actually gets to the point more. I'm sure everyone has a number, even if they don't know it yet.

At that point things will just start to get interesting. What do you expect will happen after the fork? Pretty much all the technically talented guys (who kept Bitcoin running without major incidents over the last 7 years) are working as part of the Core team. I don\'t expect them to line up behind jtoomin. Those guys will simply continue to do whatever they think is best for Bitcoin regardless of what the jtoomin survey website says and there would be enough people like me that would continue to support them.

It doesn't mean that it is, though. We don't end up with CoreCoins and ClassicCoins. We end up with bitcoins and some alt-coin (which you can call CoreCoins, they will call Bitcoin and the rest of the world will quickly call nothing, because that chain will die off...).\n\nThink of this in the real world. At some point, 750 out of the last 1000 blocks get mined by Classic. At that moment the clock starts... the fork cannot even happen for weeks! What do you think will happen during those weeks? That will be crunchtime for the Core devs and their supporters... they will be facing a fork, and they'll have a decision to make: Stick with a low work chain, or agree with the majority of the hashpower (and community) and expand the max block size? If I had any vested interest in Core, as I have in Bitcoin itself, the answer is pretty obvious.\n\nThe only imponderable is the role Blockstream plays in all this. But Blockstream knows full well that while small blocks makes their ideas more valuable, even with larger blocks their ideas are still HIGHLY valuable. The very notion of sidechains is simply awesome for a million reasons that have nothing to do with transactions per seconds, for example (want a country to have its own currency based on a Bitcoin standard? SIDECHAIN!).\n\nSo logic dictates we won't even have a fork, let alone a contentious one. If there is a fork, there will be no contest.

BTW, *that chain will be Bitcoin*!\n\nI suspect you are right in that a fork is unlikely, not because of your theory of miners and civil wars (there are no civil wars when one side has 75% of the power). But because if a fork appears to be inevitable, I have a strong feeling that Core will agree to increase the blocksize to 2MB. \n\nThen again, so many of the Core devs are in such a conflict of interests right now between Bitcoin and Blockstream that anything is possible.

And there are lots of people who feel that a 75% hard fork to Classic also violates their conditions of what Bitcoin is to them.

There is no other point to it, other than to make sure that the value of a coin in the sidechain is always the same as the value of a Bitcoin. It\'s like an altcoin that does not print any new coins, it only uses Bitcoins.\n\n> Blockstreams product is sidechains, right?\n\nSidechains are open source, but Blockstream created a productized version of a sidechain to improve Bitcoin market liquidity. It might not be their only product\n\n> Does anybody know if it worked well?\n\nLiquid has various quotes from various exchanges: https://blockstream.com/2015/10/12/introducing-liquid/\n\n> is there any advantage blockstreams sidechains, especially liquid, has over ripple? Is blockstream building ripple 2.0?\n\nSidechains can have lower counter-party risk than ripple. They can be open source and have no "lock-in". They work via smart contracts with the blockchain, which means that they can require less trust and use the security of the blockchain\n\n> Can the government send men with guns to blockstream\'s new offices in the bay area and force them to manipulate the bitcoin protocoll? Would we see it - or would the great trust in core pretend that we notice?\n\nCore Devs are spread around the world and only 15% of them are in the Blockstream office. One of them would probably say something. Also every proposed change Core has made has deliberately tried to avoid forcing any change on anyone, they want people to opt-in. As long as we always have to "opt-in" to changes it will be hard to force anything since you have to read about it and download it and install it. \n\n> Will Blockstream be able to route around every conflict of interest that may arise in the future? I believe their morally integrity - but will we ever be sure that this centralization of power will not be abused?\n\nBlockstream has only limited power, because all their software is out in the open. For example China can look at Linux and see all the source code and verify that there are no back doors or problems in it. That\'s the point of open source.\n\n> Is there a plan to build checks and balanced to controll blockstreams centralization of power?\n\nThe check and balance on the power of a developer to suggest a change is: opt-in. Any change must be opt-in, and all changes must be discussed in visible ways\n\n> If I got it right, blockstreams offers transactions with more pricacy (confidential transactions) and instant confirmation. Wouldn\'t Lightning - if it works as promised - insantly kill their business modell? Doesn\'t mean this that there are counter-incentives against implementing privacy-features into bitcoin or helping to make 0-conf-tx more secure?\n\nLightning is not a side-chain, and side chains don\'t necessarily offer instant confirmation. Lightning isn\'t even a Blockstream project, it\'s an independent project that is run by an independent open source team. Blockstream contributes one developer, Rusty, who is a long time open source advocate, a former "top deputy" to Linus Torvalds who created "iptables" for Linux, and the goal of the project is to improve scalability of Bitcoin which should be good for all Bitcoin companies including Blockstream\n\nConfidential transactions are potentially a feature that could be added to the main Bitcoin blockchain, after SegWit. There\'s already a pull request for it, however it has been implemented on a side chain to improve it and make sure that it is fully ready for deployment before adding it to the blockchain.\n': 7, "Not honestly you can't ": 1}, ('How to set up a full node and how much does it cost?', 16): {'If you are setting it at home, to help the network the most, you need a fast internet connection (upstream) and the client running all the time.
