Suddenly a lot more BTC is available on the market. The lower the price goes, the more value sellers absorb if they try to dump their holdings. At some point it has to grind to a halt.

You only find out the differences when someone triggers them.

I assume some nodes would be spitting errors, but many would not be... and when the issue was compounded by SPV mining... it seems messy.\n\nThe issue no longer appears relevant, but I find the history fascinating... and I would certainly love to understand how a major protocol issue would be fixed immediately in a scenario of catastrophe.\n\n**EDIT:** Grammar and missing words": 2, 'I just noticed that [Gavin mentioned a REAL reason for rolling out BIP66](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/bitcoin-xt/PBjK0BuB7s4/30ENrtLqBQAJ), and after going back and reading what BIP66 was meant to fix... I realised how serious that bug could have been, as it was literally a ticking time bomb. From what I understand, Bitcoin relied on OpenSSL, and it was discovered that various versions of OpenSSL would accept different signature deviations of the DER standard... which means a signature for some users would be valid and simultaneously not valid for many others.

It did seem odd to me that this was pushed at the last minute. I was wondering if there were undeclared reasons for the last-minute add. I'm sure I wasn't the only one who noticed.\n\nAlso, Bitcoin still relies on OpenSSL, although I believe the core team is trying to get rid of it ASAP. Assuming I read the messages correctly, the idea is to ditch OpenSSL - or at least as much as possible - in 0.12 and fully replace it with libsecp256k1, which is currently [used for signing but not for verifying](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2rrxq7/on_why_010s_release_notes_say_we_have_reason_to).

Instead, the specification is the reference client itself, which is Bitcoin Core.\n\nThat makes it a lot more difficult for alternative implementations to get it right, because they have to fathom the code and even the idiosyncrasies of whatever flavour of C++ is being used. It also means that any bugs that exist in Bitcoin Core are also part of the consensus rules. There are examples of this in the scripting language for example.\n\nI believe it is now considered too late to be able to migrate the specification to a specification which clients could follow, but Bitcoin Core\'s alternative approach is to split out the consensus rules a consensus library so it will be easier for other implementations to re-use the consensus library. That would, in theory, make it safer for alternative implementations to "get it right".': 5, 'People keep parroting "anti-fragile" and "honeybadger" as if Bitcoin just magically survives and gets stronger all the time by its nature.

This bug was only discovered because sipa was researching how to make BER signature encodings for [libsecp256k1](https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1), a custom C library for EC operations *written from scratch*,  compatible with OpenSSL's implementation. ": 8, 'Another problem is the following. From what I\'ve seen in the PRs and on the dev discussion list, fully extracting the consensus rules into a separate library is a great idea on paper and a nightmare to implement.
