I would also encourage anyone else to give it a try. From my perspective there's no reason why the two implementations couldn't communicate using some shared network protocol.\n\nIt's my hope that most people don't need software installs with Flash. With desktop or mobile versions this seems unavoidable. Mobile web with JavaScript and HTML5 would work but devices will need to have more processing power added if they're to be used to play reasonably secure games. I've found that roughly 512 bits (64 CBL) is the maximum I could squeeze out of my older Android device without making the startup wait intolerable. With planned optimizations this will improve significantly but there is still a point at which some devices will struggle.

And though it\xe2\x80\x99s long been suggested that bitcoin would become a clearing system on which **genuine microtransactions** would be layered, **it was unclear that we were so close to having such a system in bitcoin already**.\n\n> Note that the scheme **requires some solution to malleability** to allow chains of transactions to be built (this is a common theme, so likely to be **mitigated in a future soft fork**), but Gregory Maxwell points out that it **also wants selective malleability**, so transactions can be replaced without invalidating the HTLCs which are spending their outputs.  Thus it proposes **new signature flags**, which will require active debate, analysis and **another soft fork**.\n\n> I\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you with **a brief list of requirements to make Lightning Networks a reality**:\n\n1. A soft-fork is required, to protect against malleability and to allow new signature modes.\n\n2. A new peer-to-peer protocol needs to be designed for the lightning network, including routing.\n\n3. Blame and rating systems are needed for lightning network nodes.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to trust them, but it sucks if they go down as your money is probably stuck until the timeout.\n\n4. More refinements (eg. relative OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) to simplify and tighten timeout times.\n\n5. Wallets need to learn to use this, with UI handling of things like timeouts and fallbacks to the bitcoin network (sorry, your transaction failed, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get your money back in N days).\n\n6. You need to be online every 40 days to check that an old HTLC hasn\xe2\x80\x99t leaked, which will require some alternate solution for occasional users (shut down channel, have some third party, etc).\n\n7. A server implementation needs to be written.\n\n> That\xe2\x80\x99s a **lot of work!  But it\xe2\x80\x99s all simply engineering from here**, just as bitcoin was once the paper was released.

In our system, anyone holding "Reputation" tokens participates in determining event outcomes.  They do this by simply submitting reports on the events to the network (after the events occur, so there\'s no element of chance to the reporting).\n\nWe created an incentive scheme to ensure that people report honestly.  Basically, lies are more variable than truths.  By using a statistical technique called Principal Component Analysis, Augur determines who is contributing most to the overall variability in a group of reporters (across multiple events).  Reporters whose reports are consistent with the consensus are rewarded, and those who are at odds with the consensus are punished.  This incentive scheme has its roots in (among other things) the [Truthcoin](http://www.truthcoin.info) consensus mechanism, and is discussed in much more detail in our post on building a -[decentralized lie detector](http://www.augur.net/blog/a-decentralized-lie-detector)!': 3, 'Yes, but since the person making the bribe is forcing the market price to deviate from its "real" value, they will lose money by doing so.

The other issue is something this drastically changing to Bitcoin's code base would never get merged in, so we'd be restricted to forking Bitcoin and sidechaining to the bitcoin blockchain, and we can do the sidechain part with eth anyway. \n\nI expect it to be usable by very techie people in the coming couple of weeks, most bitcoiners this summer (but with fake money for testing), and live mass usage in the fall (with real money, you'll be able to use either Bitcoin or ether). \n\nSo reputation is the sort of token / score in our system. When reporting on events you need to make sure people can't just Sybil attack the system, so a weighted report is the best way to do this. Your report is weighted by how much reputation you have, and you gain reputation from people who either disagree with the consensus or don't report (which happens every two months to finalize the outcomes of events on Augur). \n\nIf reporting on just a question (say a smart contract wants real world data) you get the fee multiplied by the proportion of reputation you own. If reporting on a question that has been incorporated into a prediction market, you get half the trading fees from that market proportional to how much reputation you have.  The other half the fees go to whoever created the market. So the more volume the prediction markets get, the more reporters are rewarded.

In the old days, the share Registry was (dun dun dun!) a paper ledger.  Share certificates were numbered, and you transferred them by signing them on the back to the new owner, sending it to the registrar, who would issue a new certificate in the new owner's name.\n\nNowadays, share certificates hardly ever move.  Most of them are kept by the Depository Trust Company, and brokers have an undivided interest in the pile of certificates according to how many shares their customer accounts have.  When one user sells shares and someone with a different broker buys them, they just update the (dun dun dun!) electronic ledger to reflect the new broker balances.\n\nThe legality of a block-chain type ledger depends on meeting whatever rules the SEC imposes on shareholder certificates and records.\n\n> If I give a stock certificate to a guy in Papua New Guinea,\n\nYou sign it over to them, then the registrar would issue a new certificate in their name.  This is similar to how car titles are transferred.  But most certificates these days are in the name of the DTC and stay in their vault.

Big companies have to deal with regulators gone awry, but the blockchain does not. Risk of civil asset forfeiture would be *slashed*.\n\nAnd amazingly, since the video poker game would have a real revenue stream, it would be possible to model its profitability. I guarantee you it's easier to sell cryptosecurities to Average Joe *for this reason alone*, and the result could be a HUGE boost in Bitcoin's popularity. You'd have to store the cryptosecurities in a Bitcoin wallet, after all...\n\nIt'd be like stock trading, for people who want lower hurdles to making investments, or less risk of civil asset forfeiture, or who can't discount the chance of the government making their business illegal. I imagine this would be a bigger deal in China and countries with restrictive governments. The result, you could model the profitability of a blockchain video poker program much more easily tthan could model the price of BTC. This *really* matters for attracting investors.

Examples include paying dividends, mailing annual reports, announce shareholder meetings, and voting on mergers or buyouts.  Shares are often registered in the "Street name" of a broker (where street here means Wall Street), who then forwards the various information to the individual shareholders.  That\'s how my brokerage works.  Dividends show up in my brokerage account, and they forward paper reports to me.\n\nIf Overstock keeps track of some shares via a block chain type ledger, that ledger would still need to track actual owners somehow in order to carry out the various corporate functions I listed above.  Overstock is listed on the NASDAQ exchange and is publicly traded.  So things like annual reports and form 10-K are required by the SEC.  \n\nI don\'t see how the owners of a corporation can be anonymous and unknown under US law.  You can certainly obfuscate it with a chain of offshore tax havens, but Overstock would know the first link in the chain as the "beneficial owner", and have them on their books as holding X shares.  Now, an offshore trust in Bermuda or Lichtenstein could in turn have anonymous shareholders, determined by private keys and a block chain.
