If you bought an item using bitcoin, the blockchain would record that the ownership of the digital currency has moved from the seller to you.\n\nIt is this continuous and quick recording of transactions that has the financial services industry both excited and scared. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a really, really exiting area for the asset management industry,\xe2\x80\x9d says Jackie Alvarez, who is carrying out research on blockchain for Investit, a consultancy.\n\nMost commentators say blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s biggest impact on the fund industry will be in the clearing and settlement process, the often dull side of asset management that involves moving ownership of securities from one investor to another.\n\nWhen an asset manager buys a security, a large number of in-house staff and service providers set to work processing the transaction. A record of the trade is submitted to the clearing agency, often a bank, which then matches the buyer and seller records. Money to pay for the security is moved from the buyer to the seller, while the security is given to the buyer.\n\nThese labour-intensive jobs can take days, tying up cash in the process.\n\nWidespread adoption of blockchain could mean almost instantaneous settling of securities, says Hu Liang, senior managing director of the emerging technologies centre at State Street, the US bank. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is an efficiency play.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nQuicker settlement would also have a big effect on asset managers\xe2\x80\x99 balance sheets. Fund houses would need far fewer staff for some roles, says Mr Levi.\n\nFaster settlement \xe2\x80\x9cchanges the whole workload. That is a fundamental change in their operating model\xe2\x80\x9d, adds Chris Mills, who runs the global blockchain initiative at KPMG, the consultancy.\n\nAsset managers could get rid of their cumbersome and expensive IT systems, adds Charley Cooper, managing director of R3, a consortium of banks and fintech companies working together to use blockchain. \xe2\x80\x9cAll of this would have a significant impact on reducing costs,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\n\nSteve Libby, co-chairman of the digital/fintech forum at Alfi, the fund industry association in Luxembourg, adds: \xe2\x80\x9cThe knock-on effects [of faster and more accurate settling] are very positive for the asset management industry.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nOther uses for blockchain include making it easier for asset managers to trade directly with each other, cutting out traditional middlemen such as brokers.\n\nBlockchain could furthermore play a role in preventing money laundering by helping asset managers to understand who their underlying investors are.\n\nThe adoption of blockchain by asset managers would be good news for investors, says Mr Cooper. \xe2\x80\x9cAny time you can make the system safer and reduce costs, that is good for investors.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDespite all the potential uses of blockchain, few asset managers are running projects to see if the technology works.\n\nAlex Birkin, advisory leader at EY, the consultancy, says: \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of asset managers are observing [the work that is being done to develop blockchain technology], rather than committing a lot of their money.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis is in stark contrast to other parts of the financial services sector. JPMorgan Chase said last week it had begun a trial project using blockchain to cut costs and reduce the hassle of trading. The US bank is working with Digital Asset Holdings, the New York-based start-up run by Blythe Masters, best known for creating the modern credit default swap.\n\nThe Nasdaq stock exchange used blockchain for the first time in December to transfer shares.\n\nBanks are also working together in consortiums such as R3 to see how blockchain can be used in financial markets. R3 recently opened up its membership to asset managers, although none has joined so far.\n\nOne of the reasons behind this reluctance to embrace blockchain is because of its associations with bitcoin.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe stigma around bitcoin has distracted people from the benefits of blockchain technology and the applicability of blockchain. Had there not been the stigma around blockchain, people would have realised faster how useful the technology could be,\xe2\x80\x9d says Angus McLean, a partner at Simmons & Simmons, the law firm.\n\nMany asset managers still have concerns about the technology, chiefly how scalable it is and how robust the encryption is, says EY\xe2\x80\x99s Mr Birkin.\n\nThen there is asset managers\xe2\x80\x99 general reluctance to embrace technologies. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the asset industry, technological change comes at a glacial pace. It tends to come later rather than sooner,\xe2\x80\x9d says Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, the UK-based consultancy.\n\nAsset managers who think blockchain is not a big deal for them are mistaken, says R3\xe2\x80\x99s Mr Cooper. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you are sitting there thinking this doesn\xe2\x80\x99t affect me, that is not the case.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x98Wild West of finance\xe2\x80\x99: Digital currencies grow, but concerns remain\n\nBitcoin has a chequered past.\n\nSince its invention seven years ago, the digital currency has been heavily associated with crime. It has found favour with individuals looking to buy drugs or weapons on the dark net, the part of the internet that is only accessible by means of special software.\n\nIts value has fluctuated widely. The price of a bitcoin reached a high of $1,124.75 in November 2013. It now typically trades at between $200 and $300.\n\nThere are widespread concerns about the security of the digital currency, while officials are worried about the lack of a central authority overseeing it.\n\nThanks to these issues, one US regulator described bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the \xe2\x80\x9cWild West of finance\xe2\x80\x9d in 2014.\n\nMike Hearn, a prominent developer of bitcoin, recently called the cryptocurrency a \xe2\x80\x9cfailed experiment\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nYet bitcoin is gaining some legitimacy. There are 100,000 merchants that accept bitcoin for payment, including PayPal, Expedia, the travel-booking site, and Microsoft, the technology company.\n\nThe UK also wants to become a hub for bitcoin trading and Europe\xe2\x80\x99s top court ruled bitcoin should be treated as money for tax purposes.\n\nThe court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cis the first step in securing bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s future as a genuine alternative to national currencies\xe2\x80\x9d, Richard Asquith, a vice-president at Avalara, the tax compliance company, told the FT.': 1}, ('Why B2B Pay is not using Bitcoin or the blockchain (yet)', 4): {"Surprised they didn't say lack of privacy.

[Here's](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/04/ubuntu-fixes-security-flaw-trusty-login-screen) one for which I found a source but I think there also was one that just crashes the screenlock with a long password or something similar (and I'm not talking about grub with the 27 backspaces).\n\nOn Linux, an attacker with physical access to a powered-off encrypted machine can easily replace parts of your boot chain. On Android (at least Nexus devices), there is no way to unlock the bootloader without wiping the storage. (On the other hand, if you have a phone without hardware-backed encryption, destructive off-chip attacks may allow an attacker to break your likely much weaker passphrase.)\n\nThe important part is not encryption though, IMHO, the important part is what happens during regular use. On desktop Linux, any application you run has, by default, access to all user data. Notably, your browser has access to your wallet and your keyboard. On Android, the operating system prevents one application from accessing the data of another application or interfering with certain critical components like the keyboard. On both platforms, vulnerabilities in the browser exist. On both platforms, local privilege escalation exploits are discovered from time to time that will let an attacker who has code execution in the context of one application get root access - however, on desktop, the attacker doesn't even need this! On Android, an attacker would first have to compromise an app, and in most cases, would then have to successfully perform LPE without crashing the kernel. On Linux, any code execution vulnerability in any of your apps means you lost.\n\nStagefright was such a huge deal because it was the first really big Android vulnerability since a long time that potentially allowed you to get code execution in a privileged process remotely. Stagefright-equivalent bugs are patched in desktop web browsers with almost every release, just check the release notes. Other document viewers are also not much better.\n\nObviously, if you have a phone that isn't receiving updates, you're more or less fucked. This is indeed a problem in the Android ecosystem if you are unlucky enough to have a non-Nexus device, but getting better now. If you're an absolute expert, you can of course further harden your Linux too. But assuming the average technically-savvy user who doesn't do stupidly risky things (e.g. unlock the bootloader, install software from outside the official repositories), I still maintain that Android is at least on par, but likely better, than desktop Linux. Because visiting a web site is less likely to give the attacker access to your wallet.\n\n(btw, I'm wondering a bit - how does e.g. Ubuntu handle executables and .desktop files on removable media?

The galaxy series markets and sells very well.\n\nI will still hold to my position that android phones without proper securing hardware, are more prone to attacking. I disagree about the replacing of boot chain to defeat encryption. You cannot do this with properly encrypted LUKS devices. I've looked into encrypting /boot in the past, and there appears to be pretty straight forward procedures to doing this. Even without encrypting your /boot, it would still not pose any attack vectors with proper crypto standards and passwords. You cannot mount a volume without the correct password no matter how much of the boot chain you inject/break.\n\nI think the conversation is all relative to the average users length of security mechanisms. Obviously if you have a outdated linux desktop client and you are logging in as root with a weak crypto password, your device is breakable. But with proper encryption, patched software and non-root user desktop usage, the attack vectors you specified dont exist.\n\nWhich means that in those situations, those desktop clients are still more protected than the average android phone.

He probably did have more diskspace available or could have easily and cheaply bought more. Why he didn't? He probably had other bottlenecks to worry about as well. Backups for example. Tape drives is pretty expensive. Setting it all up, having enough space. Daily maintenance etc. And every time your space allowance doubled he had to replace the backup shit too with double the size tapes. But then he ran into the next problem: tapes were too slow (the night is only so long)  so he had to get faster tapes. And then the hard disks were too slow, so upgrade all the storage. And then the network got too slow, so upgrade to 1Gb. And then in the potential disaster scenario requiring a tape restore would take 3 days of company down time. So again he had to put in an upgrade of everything and set the whole thing up differently such that a disaster scenario wouldn't mean everything was lost at once. Etc. Etc. And rince and repeat.

Of course there will be changes of the constant, but a shitload of other stuff needs to align with that and be prepared, both in work and technology.\n\nAnd while we're taking disks, even the evolution of harddisks may sound like a simple change of a constant every x years. Double the size every x years, right?\n\nNot really. Sometimes they make the bits physically smaller so more fit in the same dimension. At some point they make the platters writable on both sides. Sometimes they increase the number of the platters. Sometimes they stack more bits on top of each other, scaling vertically. Sometimes they can't reliably squeeze bits smaller anymore, but by adding error correction codes they still manage to do it anyway. And then the bits on the disc are so dense that the head can't read/write them fast enough so they have to interlace the sectors and later they increase the read/write speed of the heads. And then latency gets so important that is important to speed up the disc rotation. And sometimes they get so much data on the disc but then they run into the problem that the interface to main memory gets too slow, so they introduce DMA and go to MFM and SCSI and IDE and SATA. Etc.

This has always been the case and has yet to change.\n\nYour wallet is an older model, and we thank you for being a longtime customer, however regardless of the model, we have no power over the wallet with our 1-key and so we are unable to move your funds on your behalf into a new wallet or Bitcoin address.\n\nPlease let us know if there is anything else that we can help you with :-)\n\n": 3, "Hello Mason and thanks for stopping by. I am not going to contradict you on how BitGo works,what you've wrote is probably the case.\nWhat amazed me was that since the first time I used BitGo I have always used my login password to unlock the withdrawals, thing which I was unable to do this time.\nNo FUD intended on my side, I just want to make my problem public and maybe inspire your team to put more warning signs in the client so that users like me won't fall in the pitfalls of multi-signature wallets next time.\n": 1, "Would it be possible for him to provide his key and you use the BitGo key to move his funds to a new wallet? Isn't that what 2 of 3 is for? He lost one key and you have one key. That's still 2 of 3.

There is no seller protection for digital goods, but physically delivered is fine. So simply load up a BIP38 encrypted private key, and send it registered post. Once you have proof of delivery it cant be charged back. They cant claim fraud if it was their own card since you're delivering to their paypal verified address (dont accept unverified customers, or ship to unverified addresses).": 5, 'they didn\'t "hook you up", they just didn\'t end up stealing money that you made.\n\nthis is how the oppressors condition their sheep...to be happy they didn\'t get robbed...dafuq': 1, 'Hence the second sentence...': 3, '>That was a couple months ago\n\none of the reasons you should never sell something online via paypal or alike that can reverse the transaction': 4, 'Corollary.
