AirBitz also lets you categorize & tag transactions, just like a real checkbook program such as Quicken... and this information is encrypted and then synced to your other devices. Also, whereas Breadwallet has a very minimalist interface with little customizability (which is totally fine for many people), I appreciate AirBitz\'s customizability. For example, I can choose what bitcoin denomination I want to use (I prefer millibits) and which exchange to pull rates from.

I would expect r/Bitcoin mods to actually understand Bitcoin at a deep and thorough level, yet this is clearly not the case with every mod here.\n\nWhat is being proposed by this guy demonstrates that he does not understand Bitcoin at all, since the free market value is intrinsic to the way Bitcoin works. Having a set 1% increase in value per annum makes no sense from any perspective, and likely is not even achievable practically. It\'s a fantasy that could only be advocated in the real world by scams looking to steal money.\n\nFurther, this guy finds it fit to insult Bitcoiners in the title and in the post, as if he is separate and better than Bitcoiners, saying, "There is no question that a lot of bitcoiners think of bitcoin as their lottery ticket get rich quick scheme".. wtf?

I was under the impression that all r/bitcoin mods were not just chosen for being great mods but, like u/theymos, were also highly knowledgeable about Bitcoin. Maybe my high expectations (and wrong expectations?) are to blame for this reaction. I would not have reacted as I did and written my post, if you were not a mod; I couldn\'t have cared less if some \'random\' had made this thread. But, what did really bug me was that despite being a mod who should be enforcing civil open discussion and silencing trolls who are being provocative, you yourself made a specific provocative statement typical of Buttcoiners: "There is no question that a lot of bitcoiners think of bitcoin as their lottery ticket get rich quick scheme." -- sorry, but if you don\'t think this is provocative and completely unnecessary, then we\'ll have to agree to disagree. I think it was inappropriate, given you\'re a mod.\n\nre:\n> "The question was a hypothetical to explore the motivations of individual bitcoiners. The general narrative to many is that bitcoin is a get rich quick ponzi scheme being hyped by early adopters. This is proven out every single time there is a price rise and this forum gets flooded with more \'immature, childish, drama-queen, uninformed, and hysterical\' posts about \'going to the moon\'."\n\nI can understand the intention was a hypothetical to explore motivations. But, would you really expect honest answers anyway when bitcoiners are asked if all they care about is getting rich? I wouldn\'t, which is why I see a question posed like this as \'provocative\' and useless.\n\nYes, that\'s the narrative. But, who cares if that\'s the narrative? The \'narrative\' of anything is usually described by those \'outside the group\' who are not involved to the extent of the group\'s members. People in r/bitcoin are exposed to many different types of information. Their knowledge base concerning Bitcoin is, I\'d expect and hope, far far deeper and broader than a typical layperson\'s. So, obviously the narrative will only see the simplest thing and latch on that (price), just as it happens in the media too, which is mostly obsessed only with Bitcoin\'s price.\n\nI completely disagree that it is "proven out every single time" though. It\'s not wise to judge based on a single circumstance. Yes, there is \'euphoria\' in the sub when the price rises suddenly. Is that actually unnatural though? I think it\'s pure biological and human nature. Dopamine is released when something pleasing occurs (price rise) and whenever money is involved. Meanwhile, in the rest of the periods when price is steady or declining, but when non-price news is posted to r/bitcoin, people here are just as interested and curious and open to discussion and even \'euphoric\' with extra-good non-price news releases. So, judging the sub as filled with \'get-rich-quickers\' doesn\'t seem fair at all, and frankly just false. Maybe I\'m an optimist, but I\'d like to think this sub is majority filled with genuine people with good intentions.\n\nBy the way, I\'m not even getting into the other aspect which is that Bitcoin was **designed** to incentivize (via a token with value -- aka \'bitcoins\' with monetary value that can increase) its use and development. Price appreciation is literally part of the game theory of Bitcoin, and partly what allowed it to be bootstrapped in the first place and emerge from 0 cents to 255 dollars now. Nakamoto Institute has lots of insightful material into this trait of Bitcoin btw, in case you want further reading into the theory. There is absolutely nothing wrong with this, despite many peoples\' dislike of the price aspect and thinking it somehow \'corrupts\' the technology. Some also have disdain of buying bitcoins because of it, but it makes no sense to me, since no one complains about people who buy stocks. Those who bought Apple stock when it was less than $50 and sold now have gotten rich; any complains about them at any point for being corrupt get rich quickers? Literally, the entire stock market is condoned, yet Bitcoin somehow gets flak. Those who want to buy bitcoin purely as an investment, without concern for the technology, are well within their rights to do so, and deserve no hate or mockery from anyone for making that choice. It\'s rational and has precedent (the stock market, or any investment in a financial asset: bonds, forex, etc.). Maybe, this is the primary reason I took such umbridge with that statement of yours in this thread, and why I also outright dismiss this argument taken by most of r/Buttcoin, including u/jstolfi.\n\nre:\n> "But, bitcoin is not perfect. It has a lot of problems, many of which seriously need to be fixed."\n\nYes, agreed, but your thread did not concern this. It was not substantive in that respect. I\'m sorry if I was a bit harsh, but I\'ve noted your reaction to events has not always been \'measured\', but rather a bit emotional and \'jump to conclusion\' type? For example, you made a thread expressing confusion and unhappiness at "all the silicon valley and wall street firms getting into bitcoin and taking over" specifically mentioning Blockstream / Nasdaq news, etc. I though that was a pretty superficial analysis of events, and did make a lengthy comment trying to allay your fears, although never really received a response acknowledging what I said.\n\nTo end, re:\n> "Next time, if you don\'t like one of my posts, you can just downvote it like a normal person"\n\nNot sure what this means. Reddit involves comments, not just voting. Commenting and discussion is in fact far more helpful than mindlessly downvoting something without trying to explain the reason. By explaining myself in that post, I put myself on the line for expressing these opinions. I actually took a risk doing it. The community was free to judge your thread and judge my post, and they did. But back on topic, I don\'t think downvoting without commenting is appropriate; upvoting without comment is fine, since it\'s usually self-explanatory, but I think it\'s helpful to the person being downvoted to receive some written feedback on the reason (unless it\'s blatantly obvious like with certain r/buttcoin trolls.\n\nThanks for your thoughtful response, jratcliffe, I genuinely do appreciate it.

The price would then be set by the money veolcity equation: P = Q x T / N where Q is the total volume of payments made (USD/day), T is the average time between re-use of the same coin (days), and N is the total amount of currency in circulation (BTC).  \n\nWith the current estimate of Q (optimistically, 5 million USD/day) and assuming T = 14 days, N = 14 million BTC, we would get P = 5 USD/BTC orless  That is the price we would see if there was no speculative investment (i.e. no people holding BTC in the expectation of significant price increases) .\n\nif the price were expeced to grow 1% per year, the volume of payments Q would have to grow ~10% year in the short term (to compensate for the increase in N) and ultimately at 1% per year.': 2, 'Still beats US savings accounts.': 4, "hmmm something like cash but I can use it online and don't really need to provide my private key at all, that's a no brainer to still use it..particularly if you don't have a bank account.

If there was no speculation, its price by now should have been maybe ~2 USD/BTC.  With that price level, the mining reward would be 50 USD/block, 7200 USD/day, 2.7 M USD/year.  That would not be enough to support mining as a big industry.  There would have been no ASICs and no big mines in China.  The difficulty would have remained low enough to let each client be a miner, as was the original idea (only realy nodes, not miners, were expected to become specialized installations).\n\n> ... no one complains about people who buy stocks.

That concrete wealth is sold to customers and either distributed to shareholders as dividends or reinvested (so that you own the same percentage of a bigger pie).  ***Your profit comes from the customers who buy the company\'s goods and services.***  \n\nApple shares are worth *a lot* more now than in 1990, because 1% of Apple now is *a lot* more assets (factories, stores, patents, brands....) and makes *a lot* more goods and services than 1% of Apple did in 1990.  With a productive investment, you are making your country and the world richer, in a concrete sense -- not with more tokens, but with more goods and services.\n\nWhen you buy bitcoin or gold, you become owner of something that does not create any concrete wealth; at best it sits there inert.  The *only* way you can get a profit out of such an "asset" is finding someone else who is willing to buy it for more than you bought.  ***Your  profit can only come from another investor.***  \n\nGold is worth a lot more now than in 1990 because, well, there are suckers now who will buy it at 1200 $/oz, expecting to sell it later for more than that; wereas there were no such suckers in 1990.  Speculative investment does not make the world richer; it only shifts wealth from some people to other people.  In fact it probably makes the world poorer, because those who can make a profit from it will not do productive work, and may spend their extra money in luxury items that consume resources that could have gone into productive uses.\n': 1, 'Or the "negative interest rates" (LOL) in many countries. :)': 2, "Ah, okay, thanks.

Its called as a 'committee'.\n\nThe person running this 'committee' is usually the one who knows each member personally.\n\nEveryone pools in money each month. eg Assuming there are 10 people in the 'committee', each one will decide to pool in 0.5 million rupees per month for 10 months. All this money is collected by the guy who is running the 'committee' and then there is a bid to who would like to borrow it all for the current month. The bid is done by stating the rate of interest. The person giving the best rate gets the money. He gets only the amount after deduction of interest. This deduction is distributed equally amongst all the members (well not really distributed but they have to pool in less money the next month). This process continues each month. If you are not interested in borrowing the loan, you pick it up in the last month. As you are paying less than 0.5 million each month (depending on the deduction).

I\'m now going to treat your loan as a source of income and maybe sell it to another bank.
