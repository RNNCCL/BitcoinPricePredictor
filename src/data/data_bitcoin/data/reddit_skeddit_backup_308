While this would seem to be a major advantage for buyers at first glance, vendors are on average more sophisticated than buyers. It seems unavoidable then for this escrow system to devolve into something which greatly assists long cons and exit scams. Let me explain.\n\nUnsophisticated buyers will commonly either *forget* to sign a release transaction finalizing payment to the vendor, or deliberately not sign the release transaction in order to stiff the vendor. Sophisticated vendors, then, will justify demanding at the minimum 10% of the customer\'s purchase as payment if the timelock expires. For a high volume vendor, this amount could lead to significant value being backlogged in the event of a fire sale or long con exit scam.\n\nWhile a new vendor might have to advertise that 0% of the payment gets sent to him if the deal falls through, "reputable" vendors will inevitably post listings with 10-50% of all payments sent to the vendor in case of a dispute or the timelock expiring. You can see how this would allow old time vendors to pull off an easy exit scam.': 2, 'I don\'t really think it\'s insecure (that I know of) but it is definitely a heavy weight protocol.

However, once Bitcoin gets regulated to that point, there are centralized alternatives that make more sense. See for instance Ripple: Transactions are crypto-attested, it is centralized, but a distributed hierarchy avoids hacking risk, it transacts with little friction, it does not require any proof of work, its premined scarce token XRP is essentially worthless (in exponential decay since launch), but it offers a way to transfer IOUs and so it is a nice competitor to Paypal or Coinbase.\n': 2, 'Realistically, dont bitcoin lose more than it gains from being regulated by government?': 6, "You're mostly right...

Also, the regulatory board would use a multisig scheme to avoid central points of failure.\n\nDoes BTC stay valuable in this scenario, just because it is scarce? I do not know.

There is a presumed division, that renders commerce distinct from the notion of free speech. But I will allege that the act of commerce is, itself, indistinct from speech. Where or how one spends their value is a decision as personal and poignant as any words ever spoken or letters ever written.\n\nAs a unfortunate consequence of freedom, bad actors will engage in repugnant trade that impinges upon the rights and freedoms of others. It is the job of humanity to cooperate and see to it that trade, such as this, becomes unprofitable. Whether it is accomplished through technological achievement or through the adjustment of social mores, or perhaps a simple appeal to the underlying natural law, it is not the job of bad acting third parties to force into hiding commerce that must be dealt with by means of an adjustment to the global, social conscience.\n\nCooperation, in the manner I was just speaking about, has never been plausible until the invention of The Blockchain. I will not foist upon Satoshi's humble creation such impracticable possibilities as the achievement of world peace.\nBut in approaching Drop Zone, I am attempting to do nothing more than what is possible and possibly more efficient than what exists. I wish for Drop Zone to be nothing more than an appendage to The Blockchain. As such, it is every bit as much Bitcoin as Bitcoin itself. Just as a fungible Bitcoin enables the exchange of spaceless value with near impunity, Drop Zone removes the ability of unwelcome parties from glancing over the shoulders of those in the act of an exchange, whatever it entails. This technology disrupts the ability of buyers to gain insight into the identities or movements of suppliers making supply chains far less vulnerable to disruption. It is this innovation that separates this project from all other decentralized market solutions.\n\nWhereas Bitcoin forces us to consider the nature of money and value, Drop Zone will do the same for commerce. At its root, Bitcoin is a message passing system. Those messages that are passed, unlike any electronic message that's come before it, articulate value. Commerce is, and has always been, similarly inclined toward message passing. Whether in-person, over email, or through large, online shopping carts, fundamentally, commerce is composed of messages that are in service of the transaction wherein a final message of value is sent to a recipient in exchange for a negotiated good or service. As such, Drop Zone is a secure message passing protocol inasmuch as it is a platform for commerce. And while the problem is far beyond the scope or capabilities of the protocol in its most fundamental form, the observant might even see the tenuous skeleton of a full-fledged reputation system. Such a project is, in itself, as important and difficult as any facing this decentralized ecosystem.\n\nI hope that Drop Zone lets us all dream of a day when no man will any longer be made to suffer indignity for simply engaging in unpopular or stigmatized commerce. May all commerce be created equal.\n\nToday is a Beautiful day,\n\nMiracle Max quia omnis qui se exaltat humiliabitur et qui se humiliat exaltabitur\n````": 40, 'Interesting, thank you.

If you want to wait for perfection, then Bitcoin will never grow and become mainstream.  We have to push ahead even though its messy and imperfect.

One thing that breeds corruption is a lack of freedom, a lack of capitalism, a lack of choice, and competition.  Corrupt people get into government and take things over with regulatory capture, and create monopolies.  There could be a monopoly in Bitcoin development, and XT could be setting the precedent that Bitcoin is truly decentralized in that we can choose different forks to follow based on the community's wishes.  So if Bitcoin Core makes bad choices, or if they are not making enough choices, or if they are not following Satoshi's vision, then we can choose to opt-out and opt-in to XT or something else. I believe that is a very important precedent to set, to show Bitcoin cannot be easily usurped. If this change to Bitcoin causes any problems, we can always change it again.

Thats what the limits are there for.\n\nThis doesn't predict bitcoin growth, maybe blocks never fill up over the 100MB size...\n\nPeople that fear that in 20 years we can't handle 8GB really should look back and learn from history.\n\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/19961221060442/http://www.dell.com/products/dim/xpspro/index.htm\n\nA harddrive was about 2GB 19 years ago. Now we can buy ones that are 1000 times larger.  Does that sounds familiar? Thats exactly the growth curve of BIP101.\n\nAnd we are using only about 1% of a current harddrive, so there is quite a lot of flexibility build in.\n\nBesides that, soft limits and future hardforks can always be applied. 20 years is quite a long time.  I'm 100% certain we'll have more hardforks between now and then.": 2, 'Sure, let me quote the source:\n\n> The number of failure attempts before a success occurs in trials of this type is called a geometrically distributed random variable, and can be used to find the probability of some arbitrary true proportion resulting in more than 749 blocks of a sequential 1,000, after that true proportion has been present for some number of blocks.\n\nIE: he\'s using the geometric distribution.\n\nNow, he\'s reusing his original "0.000259803036528949" probability (from the binomial distribution), truncating it, and plugging that into a geometric distribution CDF, yielding the following numbers:\n\n* 1 - (1 - 0.0002) ** 5000 = 0.6321573498386028\n* 1 - (1 - 0.0002) ** 10000 = 0.8646917847222401\n\nAnd so on, which exactly matches his graph in section 2. So hopefully this is a clear demonstration of how he generated his numbers (which, since it matches what he\'s saying, isn\'t crazy speculation on my part).\n\nSo, as I was saying, this is a basic ~~math~~ probability error. A geometric distribution assumes independent trials (coin flips, dice rolls, etc). However a run of 5000 blocks does not constitute 5000 independent trials: If I get 700 blocks in one trial, the very next trial can only be 699,700 or 701 blocks. So obviously his use of a geometric distribution is completely wrong.\n\nNow [someone else](http://bitco.in/forum/threads/triggering-the-bip101-fork-early-with-less-than-75-miners.13/) claims to have run the numbers by simulation and it\'s from their figures that I got the 15x overestimation of fork risk. Credit goes to them as I\'m just repeating (and checking) their own explanation.': 3, 'One downside is that blocksize is not predictable bound to a max.  This means that a miner has to re-evaluate every ~70 days if he needs to buy a bigger internet connection.  This is the best thing with BIP101, it is predictable for miners ;they will know the limits they have to operate in.\n\nNext to that, it may be growing too fast. Times 4 every 70 days is faster than anything else suggested.  Why that number?': 8, "Also I check the pending transaction pool some times the day and one can see, that it's mostly nearly empty. Seems that increasing the blocksize isn't really necessary at the moment...  https://tradeblock.com/bitcoin/": 8, "He's got a basic math error, when treating overlapping sub-sequences as independent events.

There\'s no reason full node wallets need to be resource hogs or ugly in the long run.\n\nAnd why wouldn\'t you think ordinary people would like easy to use full node wallets? "The interface sucks" is not an insurmountable issue, it\'s a matter of paying the right people.\n\nAfter paying a designer or two, all we\'d have to do then is wait for the oft predicted major advances in computing power, and suddenly full node wallets could be popularly adopted in place of SPV wallets. And wouldn\'t that make the Bitcoin network *infinitely* more robust?\n\nYou don\'t think there\'s any demand for checking your address balances *fully* anonymously and trustlessly? How about making BTC payments that are perfectly indistinguishable from that of other users? Do you want perfect privacy to be at least *achievable* in Bitcoin, or would you rather eliminate all of those use cases permanently in order to prop up Bitcoin 2.0?\n\nThere\'s no reason to stand idly by as Bitcoin nodes are bloated to oblivion when doing so costs you truly private wallets *forever*. And I guarantee you *no one* is looking forward to 128MB blocks adding 6.4TB of data annually as an ongoing expense to a corporate VPS let alone home server or laptop. An expense adding up year after year, indefinitely, for little if any benefit.\n\nIn sum, it\'s a horrible mistake to stand idly by while full node wallets are bloated out of reach for most people because:\n\n1. full node wallets are the best wallets for privacy and security\n2. the only way to defeat the NSA\'s global dragnet is to use a full node which makes your address history lookups happen without making any outgoing network connections, and your payment truly indistinguishable from other payments\n3. most people never spend their bitcoins, which is why this debate is *really* about Bitcoin 2.0 - everyone outside of that limited, specialized area fully agrees we should scale up to support on-chain payments for billions of people, but we vehemently disagree on making it cost zero for Bitcoin 2.0 companies to dump arbitrary data into the main chain - they can do that on sidechains or they can pay a *fee* for the privilege.': 1}, ('Tim Draper: I expect people to run to bitcoin the way they do to gold', 95): {'I read that when it came out.

In that case, exponential technology growth combined with exponential blockchain growth means that full blockchain validation is bound by some constant amount of time on the latest hardware.\n\nThe danger is if we get to a situation where technological growth becomes linear or constant, and blockchain growth remains exponential.

Moore's law has already been dead for a decade now. While transistor counts have continued to grow, performance gains has been largely insignificant.\n\nhttp://www.extremetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/CPU-Scaling-640x637.jpg\n\nPerformance increases per core has barely doubled in a decade. Initially, the path chosen was to increase the number of cores as performance per core reached its limits. But that too ran into problems with power consumption and memory bandwidth issues.

We are still stuck with quad cores after a decade. \n\nhttp://www.extremetech.com/computing/116561-the-death-of-cpu-scaling-from-one-core-to-many-and-why-were-still-stuck/2\n\nThe trend in the industry seems to be moving to specialised processors for every task, sort of like a throw back to the old days where there was a add-in card for every function (ie sound cards,  I/O card, etc..). But if we have to buy secp256k1 cards to run a full node, then decentralization will be non-existent (I could see miners purchasing these to speed up validation to avoid mining on top of potentially invalid blocks). The other option is to do this validation on the GPU, but thus far efforts on this seem to suggest that the GPU is not very optimal for the task.\n\nRegardless, its good to know that even people like you in the big blocks camp are thinking about these issues.": 1, "Headers-first allows you to skip *full* validation (not doing script execution on txs) by replacing confidence in validation, with confidence in work - for historic blocks.

After that point, any block size limit above 0 will lead to the network becoming increasingly centralized.\n\nInstead of crippling adoption of Bitcoin with a permanent 1 MB limit, which introduces a host of other risks, like obsolescence, and weak protection from political attack owing to low public buy-in, and still doesn't fundamentally solve the problem of a perpetually growing IBD, it's better to take the risk that the mining majority will coordinate to generate five years worth of PoW to defraud you, and cap the size of the IBD by limiting validation to txs generated after a point some constant length of time in the past relative to the present.": 1, "Pruning along with headers-first already lets you do all you request.\n\nBy pruning you can 'forget' transactions as they are spent, by using headers-first you can skip full validation of historic transactions as you synchronize with the network (if those transactions/blocks have a vast amount of work on top of them, similar to centralized checkpointing, but better) - at the cost of trusting that the network was honest in the (distant) past.\n\n(Note both of this is optional)\n\nThe primary advantage of UTXO commitments is for a way to let SPV clients know about unspent transactions - under (existing) SPV security.
