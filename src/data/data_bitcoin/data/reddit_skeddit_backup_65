Gox) and the nodes (which actually have massive influence -- arguably more than miners) and the "economic majority" who actually furnish the capital that keeps the system going. \n\nEven with these omissions, you yourself have acknowledged that there is no single point of control in Bitcoin, and that instead there is a complex system of checks and balances wherein many disparate parties enjoy varying degrees of power. No single entity can be identified as "the ruler of Bitcoin" and in fact if someone or something tried to claim such a title, they would have to earn support from the other industry-powerhouses or else their efforts would fail.\n\nAs a final note, this particular passage struck me as comical:\n\n\n>In a sense Bitcoin is getting even more fragile than a centralised system who typically only got a single point of failure.\n\nThat doesn\'t make any sense. The entire point of Bitcoin (and the source of its antifragility) is the *lack* of a central/single point of failure. You yourself have just unwittingly admitted there is no such point in Bitcoin, and that instead, there are different nexuses of power capable of different (but ultimately limited) things.': 2, "Yeah, you'd think so.

That assumption has proven weak in the face of climbing orphan rates.\n\nNot only do larger blocks increase orphan rates, they also    make it easier for other miners to strangle you by filling up blocks to the max with spam transactions, creating a delay for you as you try to validate the entire block, when in the meantime your evil competitor has had a head start on the next block. \n\nI've heard people argue that miners wouldn't do that out of a shared sense of self-preservation, but I find that unconvincing. Eventually some miner will do it/has been doing it because of the profit motive, long-term consequences be damned.\n\nWe probably have no choice but to move up to 2MB due to increasing demand, however it's likely that it will add more centralization pressure, and that shouldn't be dismissed.": 5, "Actually they seem totally confused about mining.

Fire!': 1, 'Just start a full node, easy!': 3, "Prestel was V.23 IIRC. **TL;DR: Read the bit in bold**\n\nV.23 was designed as a standard for a 1200 baud half-duplex modem (i.e. could only send in one direction at a time) with a 75 baud back channel (a simultaneous slow secondary channel that worked in the reverse direction, and which wasn't really _intended_ for carrying data, but more for line turnaround protocols - i.e. for the receiving station to request that it wants to now become the transmitting station).  Modern echo cancelling techniques didn't exist at the time, so full-duplex modems had to carve up the frequency spectrum into two distinct channels, and were limited to 300 baud, or a quarter of the speed of V.23.\n\nPrestel realised that 75 baud was _just about_ fast enough to carry a user's typing, so they used the back channel as an actual data channel, allowing V.23 to be used as an asymmetric full-duplex modem, with 1200 baud down and 75 baud up.\n\nAutodialers existed, but they were expensive, and manual dialing (as shown in the broadcast) was the norm for home users.  So home modems were actually essentially analogue devices;  without the need to handle dialing, or the need to implement line turnaround, these modems were quite simply just turning voltages on the RS232 line into tones on the phone line - and back again.\n\nBack then what a modem did was simply FSK modulate a carrier directly from the RS232 serial line - complete with start and stop bits - so 1 character per second corresponds to 10 baud (1 start bit + 7 data bits + 1 parity bit + 1 stop bit, or alternatively 8 data bits and no parity).  So you divide by 10 to get characters per second - so 120 characters per second down and 7.5 characters per second up.  Taking characters as equivalent to bytes that gives you **120 bytes per second down and 7.5 bytes per second up!** (although arguably when using 7 data bits with parity it's really equivalent to 105 bytes per second down and 6.5 bytes per second up).  At these speeds a typical videotex-format page (24 lines of 40 characters each) could take up to 8 seconds to load!\n\nAlso, there was no error correction - parity sometimes provided rudimentary error _detection_ - so line noise could (and frequently did) result in lost or corrupted characters in either the display or the keyboard input.\n\nAlso interesting to note, the equivalent US standard - Bell 202 - used a 5 baud back channel.  Just about adequate for a simple line turnaround protocol, but at 0.5 bytes per second, way too slow for this hack to have been usable in the US.\n\nThe Prestel hack (i.e. 1200/75 baud full duplex) became quite commonplace for BBSs in the UK (and quite probably in the rest of Europe, although I don't know).": 9, 'Mystery solved!
