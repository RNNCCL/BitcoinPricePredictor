All they have to do is release a small number of keys at 10minute intervals.\n\n2 Keys released every 10minutes with 0.1 BTC each. Hard to say how many transactions each will generate, it is looking like hundreds from the first few they have released. \n\nI am anticipating the mempool to grow to 600-1000Mb as a result of this.\n\nBitcoin is undergoing another massive stress test starting today, and it is hard to say when it will end.\n\nRather ingenius of the people who put this test together.\n\nInstead of simply generating thousands of raw transactions, this group (CoinWalletEU) filled just a couple thousand address with 0.1BTC. However to get to 0.1BTC they used hundreds of inputs from other addresses.\n\nNow, they are releasing the private keys to these 2,000+ addresses at ~10minute intervals. What this means is that everyone has a chance to grab these bitcoins since the private key is known to all. Everyone can generate a transaction that sends the 0.1BTC from that address to an address they control only, at least before the first confirmation. So there is at least a 10minute window for everyone to try to generate these transactions to send the coins to themselves. The trick is, only the transaction with the highest fee will get included in the blockchain. So inevitably very little money will be made from "sweeping" these keys because someone would rather get $0.01 than nothing, and so if they see you are swiping the key worth $10, and paying $9.98 in miners fee ($0.02 profit), they will swipe for a higher fee just so they can get the $0.01, at least in theory. Additionally because these addresses were filled from hundreds of inputs, each time the address is swiped it generates a very large chain of transactions. And each address is likely to be attempted to be swiped dozens, if not hundreds or even thousands of times.\n\nAdd on to this the growing size of the memory pool (mempool for short). Bitcoin can only process 1MB worth of transactions per 10minutes. Initially we assumed that the addresses would all be swiped within the 10minute interval after they were released, but since there are so many transactions being generated by the swiping it is generating a backlog, which means it is taking much longer to get a transaction included in a block, meaning that there is more time for each address to be swiped, which creates more transactions, and an even greater backlog. It is absolutely genius.\n\nSo we should expect to see the memory pool grow to hundreds if not thousands of MB in size. Which could lead to a transaction delay of a week or more, if you don\'t include the appropriate fee.\n\nThis should break a few websites and apps, and hopefully both show the resilience of the network to such antics, and pave the path forward towards upgrading network capacity.\n\nThe events are unfolding mostly here: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1175321.100\n\n': 18, '* Release

belonging to those addresses have already been spent. (many people are swiping, or trying to) Each address has a little over a thousand outputs 'in its name', most of which have been spent.\n\nAs far as I can see these coins are segregated into outputs of 0.0001 BTC (~2 cents) each, meaning it will cost roughly the same amount in fees to include those outputs in a spending transaction.\n\nSwiping transactions will be huge, containing hundreds of inputs and a single output. They will take a long while to validate, and would put quite a strain on network validation capacity aswell as bandwidth (albeit probably to a lesser degree).\n\nThe net result of this, unless there are any larger non-dust outputs I'm missing, will be ~0 profit for anyone trying to swipe these outputs, roughly the full amount spent to miners in the form of fees, and an increased strain on auditors/validators of the blockchain.\n\nAlso, there's no reason for miners not to re-sign any transactions 'swipers' are broadcasting to their own output, since the private key is known.

The real estate bubble was created by municipal Party members whose job performance and promotions were tied on increasing local tax revenues, and the best way to do that is to build lots of buildings, which raises property values and tax income. The banks in China are far from independent, so they lent to whomever the Party told them to, and eventually they accumulated too much underperforming debt, putting China at risk for a US-style 2008 collapse in real estate prices.\n\nSeeking to prick this bubble, China cracked down on real estate silliness but all the money being generated had to go somewhere, and so the great Chinese stock bubble began.

This means the reason to use altcoins disappears, reinforcing Bitcoin's dominance and incentivizing the end of reputation-damaging altcoin pump 'n dumps as well as incentivizing altcoin developers to focus their efforts on a bitcoin-centric world (instead of trying to reinvent the wheel for glory or riches).\n\nI think the root problem for most people who are antagonistic towards sidechains or Lightning is, simply, ignorance.

Everyone is too caught up focusing on *Bitcoin-the-medium-of-exchange*, or in other words: *Bitcoin the payment network*.  This is an important aspect of it, and worthy of making it as useful as possible. . . but it is ultimately a means towards and end, not the end in itself.\n\nPeople need to understand the much much greater utility and value that there is to be had in actually bootstrapping the bitcoin unit into a fully-actualized money, and what that means for the empowerment of people to save, of entrepreneurs to more rationally calculate, for all of us to evade government theft through inflation and also from confiscation and capital controls, and to fully enable the power of the globalized economy which has been so long held back by the artificial separations and exchange inefficiencies  caused by nation-states and their fiat currencies and their petty interests.\n\nVery few users here now realize that bitcoin is not yet money, and the implications of that.  Nearly everyone is disillusioned with bitcoin because they (as I predicted long ago) think that it is fully actualized in its current state, and that basically all that\'s left to do is scale with growth.  But that\'s not the situation.  There is still a massive public goods problem to be overcome in bootstrapping bitcoin into money.  If you think bitcoin is just a decentralized paypal. . . you\'re in for a rude awakening when (and it\'s already happening now) centralized payment networks start running circles around almost everything that Bitcoin-the-payment-network can do.\n\nNearly everyone has forgotten that achieving an exchange value for bitcoin (initial price discovery), was just the beginning; it was just one step towards a much larger and longer-term goal (often summed up as "bootstrapping") that originally excited those of us who have been around since early on.\n\nMost of us have already got plenty of affordable and capable payment mechanisms.  What the world really needs is new, better, market-based money.  A common unit of account.  A trustless store of value.  The fact that bitcoin units also enjoy their own built-in payment network, Bitcoin, is only ancillary to bitcoin the money and is in fact a fundamental necessity (given that people have previously used physical goods as money/ledger units and the physical world gave us a payment network built-in, i.e. sneaker-net. . .but bitcoin being digital or virtual needed to provide it\'s own mode of control and transmission between the physical and virtual world, hence the payment network aspect).  But that says nothing as to whether Bitcoin\'s payment network must necessarily be the only or primary means whereby to transact the bitcoin units.  The important thing is that those units become the most saleable, most ubiquitous commodity: money.

For one, you would either need to require that transactions aren't accepted until their sequence number is next, or, if you allow transactions to skip sequence numbers, you would only be able to safely have one unconfirmed transaction per address at any time (assuming you want to ensure that every transaction clears).\n\nAt any rate, you can't get around the fact that each address, even empty ones, require data to be permanently stored. Unless, that is, you make it so that it costs money to create an address. By requiring people to keep a deposit on open addresses, you can implement a system where people have an incentive to close that address. When you close an address, you acknowledge that the network will no longer keep track of which transactions from that address have already occurred (via transaction hashes, sequence numbers or whatever). If you ever reopen that address, it would be on you to provide that information.\n\nNow, address-based systems aren't all that bad. They have plenty of benefits as well. Ripple would be a good system to read about if you are interested in learning more.

You could perhaps buy Ford, or GM eventually, yet there was not any one single unit of measure which was tied directly into the invention.\n\nThe same thing when the TV was invented.

I am very highly against the idea that it is right to accuse people of things without any sort of evidence or legitimacy whatsoever.

He has decent knowledge wrt markets and such, but his thinking is not rigorous enough. He accepts possibilities, even if they are not backed by evidence. I am extremely strong on needing evidence, or legitimate reason, before I will believe something. Cypherdoc has lax standards in that regard; maybe his ego is too strong.

So, let\'s not blame "mods" (as if it\'s a conspiracy), nor Core devs for being involved, nor Blockstream. **ANY** insinuation to the contrary is highly dishonest and immoral.\n\nOn to the second point, yes, it is my opinion that u/theymos\'s censorship of XT on r/bitcoin and his moves on bitcointalk played the majority of the role in galvanizing support for XT. Before this move, XT had been brought up but was more or less being found out for being ill-conceived. It was around that time that it was realized in the XT FAQs that Gavin and Hearn intended to be the only 2 \'leaders\', and moreover, that Hearn would be the ultimate decider, even over Gavin. This obviously was not liked by anyone, even XT supporters, since Gavin is the more popular of the two (besides having some degree of \'divine right\' in that Satoshi handed control to him -- not to Hearn). So anyway, the general consensus was in this direction of disfavor to XT... until suddenly u/theymos came in and threw his weight around. I\'ve seen all over the ecosystem that the majority of people think the XT censorship was in horrible taste. The emotional reaction that ensued is mostly what made XT subreddit be created and helped 12,000 people join it (as protest).\n\n\n\nre: 3\n> odd that you would dismiss the idea that there is a majority who wishes to "overthrow" the Core devs\n\nYeah, I agree block size debate was basically at a standstill and stagnant for a very long time. Even though the wise thing to do would be to plan for the future and make some move, most people were content to unwisely sit still and ignore the issue. They seemed to miss the point that many entities will ignore Bitcoin until they know it has a plan in place, since it\'s very risky business-wise.\n\nHowever, XT played its role by existing in the beginning and bringing this problem to light. And, it caused Core devs to realize their mistake and start changing their positions, by and large. Things were cooling down, progress was being made, negotiations were occurring. Most people were quite explicit that they prefer Core to XT, but that they want Core to adopt a block size increase, such as Gavin\'s BIP 101, and that they would vote for Core BIP 101 over XT. I\'m not really going to argue this point. If you can\'t see why having 2 leaders in charge (with a single decider with veto power) is bad vs. the 5 \'leaders\' in charge with Core (with a single "maintainer" who can be overruled by the others), then you\'re just not being fair. Not to mention, as we saw recently, 90% of Core devs support the status quo. Is it sensible for XT to \'win\' and then Bitcoin possibly lose certain degrees of emotional / technical support from the 90% of Core devs and libbitcoin devs and btcd devs? Just, no. It makes zero sense. Yes, Core made a mistake by dragging its foot with scalability, but they have reformed and proposed all kinds of BIPs and informal proposals since then that compromise and do increase size.\n\n> If the Core devs refuse to budge, I don\'t think it\'s controversial to say that people will naturally look for alternatives\n\nYes, and that already happened. That\'s what I\'m saying. Before u/theymos interfered, people looked for alternatives (XT), and this helped bring an end to the stasis. Core reformed, BIPs were proposed, progress was made. Ecosystem pressure was increasing for devs to reasonably attack the scaling problem. We were on a positive path forward, regardless of the tensions under the surface.\n\n> Perhaps you could argue that it is impossible to decentralize dev, but to argue that it would be a bad thing seems to come from left field.\n\nThis. I don\'t know what people think for ideological reasons. I think it\'s clear we have very few people in the world with the knowledge to develop Bitcoin. Sorry, it is what it is. The knowledge is so specialized already with cryptography, and then adding Bitcoin to it narrows the field more. On top of that, add that you can\'t read a single book and be caught up (you need to know the history, what decisions were made and why, all the dev mailing list discussions to truly understand tradeoffs, etc.), and it becomes an impossible task to truly decentralize dev. It\'s simply a fact that the Core committers are irreplaceable (u/adam3us, u/nullc, u/pwuille, u/petertodd, Gavin, Mike, Wladamir, Freidenbach, etc.). There is a very small group that makes most of the commits and does the majority of development. Then, there\'s another group that does tiny amounts of development in contrast. So, for bitcoin to succeed, it needs its development team to stick together and be cohesive. Neither you nor me could take the reigns tomorrow and develop Bitcoin\'s protocol on our own. These guys have too much expert knowledge.\n\n> I did not expect pushback on the idea that development should - like everything else - be decentralized if possible.\n\nI\'m having trouble understanding what you said before this above line. Regardless, in terms of that line, I think I\'ve explained my reasoning above :). It\'s not fun or fortunate, same way that centralized mining is unfortunate yet we can\'t do anything about it really (maybe 21 can, if they do it right, who knows!), but it is a fact. The level of specialized knowledge is mindbogglingly vast. I read like crazy, yet I have to have the humility to say I\'m not prepared to make any decisions or change anything in the protocol (too many moving parts, everything is interconnected, etc. etc. etc. etc.).\n\nHonestly, the only way forward for the community (IF we have the high bar that we want the ideal Bitcoin, as described in the r/bitcoin sidebar, the one that gives you the power to truly \'be your own bank\' and not have any regulatory authority able to interfere by introducing capital controls) is to have all the devs stop fighting and compromise together. If that does not happen, you may as well jump ship to a better alt (if it even exists) in the hopes it will learn from Bitcoin\'s mistakes and make the right decisions.': 2, 'Interesting, Eragmus. You don\'t seem to be arguing in good faith like you always used to, as there are three obvious overreaches here: \n\n1) I made a point of *not* defending cypherdoc, as I neither know (nor care) of his guilt or innocence here.\n\n2) Let\'s just assume he is culpable for now. The case has been ongoing for a long time, but this is the first time I\'ve seen it on the front page here getting upvoted. This case and his gold thread on Bitcointalk flew under the radar until this blocksize debate heated up and his thread was suddenly locked by mods. This isn\'t conspiracy, just bare fact of convenient-timed censorship as you - to your credit - acknowledge. But to suggest that the censorship of alternatives is what single-handedly caused the surge in support for alternatives is an head-scratcher. \n\n3) The current Core devs have been around for a lot less than 6 years, and ironically Gavin has been around the longest. But it\'s particularly odd that you would dismiss the idea that there is a majority who wishes to "overthrow" the Core devs (decentralization does not entail overthrowing anyone...that\'s the whole point, overthrowing and coups are concepts in *centralized* governance) because it\'s clear to all that there are many people dissatisfied with their handling of blocksize. I would call that a groundswell, and I didn\'t mention a majority even though it seems fairly likely to be one. If the Core devs refuse to budge, I don\'t think it\'s controversial to say that people will naturally look for alternatives. But beyond that, I also wonder if you really wanted to take a stand for centralization of development. That\'s taking things to another level. Perhaps you could argue that it is impossible to decentralize dev, but to argue that it would be a bad thing seems to come from left field.\n\nJust overall this feels bizarre. I would have expected a response more like, "Some people are taking low blows, but this has no bearing on the validity of the arguments. A bunch of bitcoiners are worried about blocksize and fronting like they\'re supporting other implementations, but that\'s not going anywhere ultimately because the Core devs will come up with a decent solution before things get out of hand, then any such groundswell of support will vanish." That\'s something I can at least understand, even though I doubt it will play out like that.

People switched TO bitcoin, even though there were virtually no users, service providers, etc. The reason people switched TO bitcoin is the same reason they could possibly switch away to a minority network:  the feature set provides so much value, that the smaller group of users is an acceptable price to pay.\n\nI think it may be helpful to think of the bitcoin node software, and the human operator of it, as two separate entities (and therefore two separate nodes). The human has a high degree of trust in the software (depending on his technical level, but even bitcoin experts must trust that the underlying hardware is honest). So there\'s really always at least 2 tiers, with the human being the lower tier. There could only be 1 tier if the human manually calculated everything without the use of a machine.\n\n~~One conclusion that you seem to avoid making, is that "bitcoin as a settlement layer" is infeasible. If it cost you a $50 miner fee every time to "know you\'ve been paid", then you would have no reason to run a full node. Almost nobody is willing to pay that.~~ (edit: I think I understand now why you don\'t conclude that - IIUC you think the non-hardware costs far outweigh the hardware costs. I\'m not so sure. To know you\'ve been paid and avoid censorship you only need to receive data without the authorities knowing you\'re receiving it. There\'s more ways to do that than just Tor - steganography for example).\n\nFinally, I\'m glad you touch on the fact that having good censorship-resistant layers beneath bitcoin would increase its value.

You need to take into account that this process is constrained by both my downstream and the upstream of the nodes I may connect to and the network between us.
