In your case, the fact that the transaction has to "complete" does not seem, in my interpretation, to mean that it has to complete by any particular date. When you buy stocks and shares, it often takes a few days to "close". But you still get the price and conditions agreed upon originally - they can\'t be changed later. \n\nHere\'s what it boils down to, in my opinion: coinbase is not like a local bank or a retailer. If something goes badly with an interaction, they will not try to make it right. You are stuck, with no recourse except the courts, which you are obviously not going to do for $75.\n\nBy the way, "caveat emptor" refers to the sale of real estate or similar goods, in which the seller knows more about the condition of the property. It does not refer to the interpretation of sleazily written contracts.\n\nMy experience was as follows: I received an email due to a referral from a friend with the subject "Get $10 of bitcoin for free when you buy $100 or more of bitcoin. Download the app now!". I did this, and bought $100 of bitcoin. No $10 appears. Here is the entire contents of the online chat I had with a customer representative:\n\nHenry: Hello there! How can I help you today?\n\n\xe2\x86\x92I signed up after receiving a referral email with the subject "Get $10 of bitcoin for free when you buy $100 or more of bitcoin." Now that I have bought $100 of bitcoin, do I need to do anything to get my additional $10?\n\nHenry: The following article will explain the referral credit in detail as well as give you some possible reasons why you did not receive it. https://support.coinbase.com/customer/portal/articles/683805-how-does-the-coinbase-referral-program-work-\n\n\xe2\x86\x92Are you saying that I am not going to receive it?\n\nHenry: It\'s all automated.

Maybe since there was a $1 fee to make the purchase, I only got $99 so it didn\'t count as $100. Maybe the value of the bitcoin once the transaction completed had gone down a bit, so it didn\'t count as $100. Maybe I didn\'t click on some link in an email somewhere that never told be I had to click on a link. I don\'t know.

In my experience as a customer, initiating a quality transfer was one in the same action as purchasing bitcoin.  \n\nTo reiterate, there was no further action for me to take.  I had already fulfilled my end of the bargain.  In essence, I accepted the offer through my actions.\n\nI won't try to define the words offer and acceptance here.  If you're truly interested look at the Wikipedia article for Offer and Acceptance, it's not a bad explanation of how things work in the US.  Beyond that, you can look many places to find the legal definition of a contract...which is based on an offer plus acceptance, plus other things.\n\nTo speak about contingencies, let's take a common example: a real estate sales contract contingent upon sale.  If I submit a contract to purchase your home, contingent upon the sale of my own house and we both sign it, then I don't have to actually purchase your house until I sell mine.  That doesn't mean I can drop the price arbitrarily on a whim...just because.  Now let's throw in the famous fine print where Coinbase can change the program on a whim.  I don't have any problem with the concept at all.  My problem is that they made a public offer, my actions constituted acceptance of that specific offer, and thus we had a contract.  They claim to have changed the offer, but that only happened **after** I had already accepted it.  They've broken the contract.  They are in the wrong.\n\nIf you still disagree with me on the premise of what constitutes an offer or an acceptance, I won't argue it any further.  I believe I am right.  My lawyer believes I'm right.  Any anyone else is free to make up their own mind.": 1, 'You can "see" whatever you like, but explain to me what words I\'m misusing?   \n\nThe offer has always read as " If your friend visits coinbase.com/buys and purchases $100 USD or more (or 100 EUR, or 100 GBP, or 100 CAD, or 100 SGD) of bitcoin..." this clearly indicates the offer is extended contingent on a purchase as I\'ve said; not on initiating a deposit or transfer as you\'ve implied.

Hard to find the right secret you need but easy for other miners/nodes to verify it?\n\nThat way the IO bound is really the speed that the partially non-deterministic information could be retrieved (long distance with the speed of light limit) and it's random if the information works for the miner or not. The nodes would be half of the mining. This could also be a nice way to incentivize running a full node, by the way.\n\nOr maybe to prevent cheating/collusion you have to design to a whole new mining scheme where there are red miners, blue miners, yellow miners.. and they are all used to mine the next block.

I then came to your farm with twenty men and guns and told you that we are the new government. I would allow your 15 member family to vote on some issues, but of course you would be in the minority against the 20 of us. We would then proceed to vote that you have to give us all your land. If you would protest, we would simply point out "the sovereignty of the state" and how you had signed a social contract with us. I would also tell you that you are free to leave your farm if you don\'t want to adhere to the social contract. Would that be ok with you?\n\nWell, first, I only argued against your slaves analogy, but, of course. \n\nBut first, I want to point out that this scenario ignores some basic structural problems. For example, that the US created Indian Reservations after doing basically this to the Indians\xe2\x80\x94 which while not perfect from a modern moral standpoint is a far cry from what you suggested, and that the Federalization of the US from the Colonies wasn\'t in any way comparable to coming up to an independent farm and taking it over with guns (it was replacing one government with another through guns, the Crown Loyalists basically were allowed to and in fact did get up and leave). After that, everything was democratically assented to through an agreed upon process, so there isn\'t really a good claim that something went wrong around the period of the Civil War and that the use of weapons then was unjust. Finally, its not like any of this happened within the past 150 years, so the idea that your proxies or your own actions haven\'t caused some form of consent / assent to our modern social contract is hard to believe. There might be five people in the entire United States who could maybe make some form of argument that their free family farm was invaded, taken over, subjected to the US Government, and they have an unbroken lineage of proxies who have never consented, and they have never done anything that amounts to consent themselves. So to me it\'s a bit silly to examine this.\n\nNow let\'s get into it in the case this ever did actually happen:\n\nAll rights are social context based rights. If you\'re outnumbered and outgunned, you\'re fucked. Here\'s the issue\xe2\x80\x94 you can\'t claim that what these twenty men with guns did is normatively *wrong* without relying on private property, and more specifically, our society\'s interpretation of and respect for private property.\n\nWe *feel* that your above scenario is wrong, but we only feel that way because of our existence under our current social contract which highly respects the idea of being there first and making a claim. In the State of Nature, norms are very different, and up until the 1960s/1970s, international norms were very different as well.\n\nThe idea is that as soon as someone makes a private property assertion (say, your assertion that it is somehow *my* or *my family\'s* farm), they have committed an act of aggression against the world.\n\nJust because you were there first, I can\'t use this land for my family? Why can\'t I build my farm there? What if there is someone else there everywhere? What if there is no room for my farm (which is essentially what you argued above in the case of an expat having nowhere to go). \n\nWhat this justifies is me using weapons to take a farm I want. You have limited my freedom of action in the Universe, and therefore I have no obligation not to harm you. But I can do what it takes to survive. If you make a property claim, then I can make a property claim too, and in the absence of government, the only thing thats going to sort it out is force (who wants it more or who survives).\n\nThis was called Right of Conquest and it was in effect from basically the beginning of man until the 1960s or 1970s depending on which treaty was used.\n\nWe stopped because humanity collectively decided we were basically killing too many people and too many innocents were getting caught up because of how insane our weapons had gotten.\n\nNow, of course, if you want to fight the entire international system on this, I\'m not going to pass moral judgement on you, because the moral judgement that it is wrong is internal to the international system, but I will advise you, you will likely lose.\n\nIn the specific case of your analogy, I don\'t think they would say you had signed a contract\xe2\x80\x94 but I do think you could say the social contract between us is this, if you don\'t like it, you can leave, or we can demand your compliance through force. I don\'t even know why you included the voting issue, as that doesn\'t even matter. One of the guys with guns could be giving orders to all the others. One reason people use the term "signed" in the US is because you do sign documents like your drivers license and your Social Security Card, which more or less are actual contracts.\n\nThere\'s an interesting episode of Walking Dead where the group takes over a Prison and there were some people living there already. It examines this exact same moral issue outside the construct of pre-existing social contract / norms.

If we are consumed by another society, what becomes normative changes. To an outside observer, there is no right or wrong it just is.\n\nThough personally, even within our society I don\'t see why something is someone\'s just because they were there first.

Thanks for your support!': 1, "Hang on... you can ship anything you want with stamps. They even sell stamps for use on Priority flat rate packages. While I am sure USPS would love to know all the personal details of every shipper, their willingness to sell stamps (which can be paid for in cash, no less) and also ship literally anything that has enough stamp-based postage, implies that they're more concerned with revenue than data mining the personal details of every customer. \n\nI'm all for donning a tinfoil cap every now and then, but in my experience you can ship a box full of lead using any combination of stamps so long as it covers the shipping cost and the stamps fit on the same face of the package as the addresses.": 11, 'Ok, I\'ll put the tinfoil hat on for moment.\n\nI guess define "anonymously" in this context... because if you live in the US or UK or any other country with a powerful and aggressive government then you\'re not likely to manage many in-person cash transactions without your presence being recorded on CCTV and ultimately being (theoretically) linked to a specific transaction. So, sure, you can go buy some stamps with cash at a post office and mail something more-or-less anonymously at a later date by dropping your letter or parcel in a USPS drop box using those stamps, but man that sounds like a hassle. \n\nThen again, if you\'re dedicated to engaging in anonymous transactions then you\'ll ultimately find yourself hunkered down over your laptop (running TAILS or similar) at a coffee shop or library conducting your business via a series of VPN tunnels, SOCKS proxies and TOR connections. Your money is a wallet full of bitcoins you either purchased in a face-to-face transaction in an place without surveillance cameras, which you then "tumbled" through some TOR service that took a small percentage of the funds. Wait, didn\'t they arrest Ulbricht at a library using some combination of those technologies?\n\nI don\'t really have a point, except that it\'s really, really fucking difficult to be anonymous today if you\'re engaging in just about any kind of commerce. I find it difficult to justify the amount of effort involved in such pursuits, as much as I would love to not be "tracked" or even "watched" by a bunch of corporations and governments. If I have something to say to someone that I really, really don\'t want *anyone* reading, I might jump through some hoops (PGP, encrypted whatever, etc), and I always employ what I consider to be bare-minimum security (very strong passwords, encrypted drives on my computer, encrypted phone, secure Telegram chat, etc), but that is more a result of a lifetime interest in computer security than any actual paranoia. I do not want to say "I have nothing to hide so what do I care?" but in reality that does play a role. I have no need to send letters or parcels anonymously... but it is interesting to consider how one might do so if they decided they needed to.\n\nAll that said, I think things like TrackMeNot, Disconnect, and similar browser plugins are good fun. I like the idea of TOR as well, though I do get the impression enough of the TOR network is nation-state operated that it\'s not nearly as "anonymous" as many think.\n\nSorry for rambling on. It\'s a very interesting topic. And actually, though I have been using Shipnik for a couple months now, I never even considered it might be useful for "anonymous" mailing! If it works via TOR and with javascript disabled... Shipcoin and Shipnik may be seeing some good business once it catches on in the "dark net" markets... but I\'m guessing, at least with Shipnik, there is quite a bit of JS involved, which is probably a deal breaker for DNM participants.': 1, 'I can\'t even count how many priority boxes, letters, and other small parcels over 13 ozs.

No package or letter has ever been a problem. Is this a real USPS policy? If so, my experience suggests they have few, if any, fucks to give about it. \n\nEdit: And yes, many of these items have been mailed with stamps instead of printed USPS labels.

All living things aggress against other living beings when they consume limited resources. The only way to act in concert with the non-aggression principle is to passively wither and die.

One indicator of intelligence, or education, however, is questioning secondary and tertiary sources.\n\n3) I don't find your conclusion to be the case, and I wonder how that jives with well known statistics like, Unitarian Universalists, the most liberal of all religions, having the highest SAT score. I think what you're misrepresenting, potentially, is that at higher intelligences certain classes of views are more likely than at lower intelligences, which include libertarian, fascist, statist, communist, and a whole slow of not-necessarily-party-line political views. The problem is you used the statistic, if it does exist, to make an argument implying that somehow libertarian views are more likely correct, and more specifically, that you can draw a conclusion about a statists intelligence because they are not a libertarian. Which is pretty much the worst logic I've ever seen. Even if we were to say that intelligence reflects on whether or not someone is likely to be right, statism can be just as if not more likely at higher intelligence levels, than libertarianism, without contradicting your assertion.\n\n4) According to http://www.triplenine.org/HowtoJoin/TestScores.aspx I have six qualifying exams.

While theoretically cute, it is a logical impossibility in a physical, localized universe with resource constraints and the basic laws of thermodynamics.\n\n6) I like the internet being open. It would be a shame for all traffic to have to be white listed and tagged with identifying user information. While one could potentially circumvent such measures by embedding subversive material in legitimate content streams, it is mathematically and logistically difficult to do so for large amounts of data needed to run protocols like Bitcoin in real time. It would be nice for people to be able to use these systems, behave and operate within the bounds of our social contract, so that more aggressive actions (such as banning all private use of hard encryption) isn't necessary.\n\n7) Generally people who resort to calling someone a dumb fuck without discussing the question or point at hand, do so because they can't engage in a meaningful discussion of the subject. If you'd like to engage, I'm happy to do so but my guess is you're now realizing you'll be outclassed.\n\n*Edit: 8) Not saying I'm one of them, but some people like hot lunches.*": -2, 'The key is this is becoming more and more true as technology advances.': 5, 'I wish bitcoin was like that.

Windows 7 is very easy to get a node running quickly. Honestly once you consider a Pi pretty much requires a wi-fi dongle, a bootable microsd, a wired/wireless keyboard/mouse, a monitor, a mouse, HDMI cable, power supply, case and a 128GB+ storage, the Acer looks pretty damn good unless you already have the former lying around. The Acer does use more power than the Pi, but we\'re talking about a few dollars of electricity a year.\n': 3, 'Low CPU activity and IO....': 1}, ('What Can China Teach Russia About Bitcoin?', 1): {}, ('Parlay: Phone App to Challenge Friends and Wager Bitcoin', 4): {}, ('Check out the new & improved P2SH.info', 36): {'is the project open source? might be interesting to add bitcoin 2.0 stuff?': 1, 'Looks good.\n\nCould it be made to show the usage rates of 2of2 and 2of3 multisig p2sh, maybe along with other common redeemScripts ?': 3, "It's not open source at the moment though the plan is to eventually make the blockchain parsing code open source.
