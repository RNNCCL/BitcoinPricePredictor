When dogecoin hard forked to implement AuxPoW some people continued mining on the old pre-AuxPoW chain.  Even today a year and a half later the branch isn't completely inactive.  It even caused an exchange to fail and people to lose money.  I can't remember the name of the exchange right now, but I can look into it if you want.  The exchange hadn't upgraded to the new fork, so they were accepting coins that were mined on the old fork for deposits.  Obviously these weren't valid post-AuxPoW.  And when people went to withdraw they were finding their withdraws weren't valid.  The exchange had mixed up old fork and new fork coins together.  They lost liquidity and the exchange collapsed.\n\nOverall, the hard fork was very successful I'd say.  But there are risks, and with bitcoin's ecosystem being so much larger than dogecoin's, I'd be astonished if there weren't at least one guy out there that runs some fire and forget automated financial service that didn't upgrade, will accept coins mined on the 1MB branch, and cause problems.  I am in favor of a hard fork, but it does need to be done carefully and with a long activation period, giving plenty of time to upgrade.  (Dogecoin gave about a month iirc to upgrade, it was an emergency situation.  I think bitcoin's should be much longer than that).": 3, "CLAMs was a type of a spin-off altcoin.\n\nNot sure if that's the type of scenario OP was asking about.": 2, "Old clients absolutely will know and care about the more-work chain, and will complain about it until they are upgraded to understand the higher block size limit. Proof-of-work is visible in the block headers, and headers-first downloading of branches of the chain means clients are fully aware of more-work branches before the perform full validation and discover a block is bigger than they think is legal.\n\nSomebody could release a new client that looked for and then purposely ignored the higher-limit branch of the chain... But nobody sane would run it.\n\nThe incentives to go with the stronger branch of the fork (where 'stronger' is a complicated combination of hash power and number of businesses and users on that branch) are very, very strong.\n\nTo answer the original poster's question: no, there is no reasonable scenario where we end up with two persistent branches of the Bitcoin block chain.": 1, 'If you are running Bitcoin Core v0.12 or earlier at the time of the big blocks hard fork, your client will reject the side with the big blocks for being invalid.   So your node won\'t know nor care about the fork(*).   As long as there is some not insignificant level of mining occurring (e.g., 25% of the pre-fork level), the original chain will persist.\n\nBut the value of the coins on each side of the fork are no longer the same.   One side will trade at a discount to the other. \n\nMost people think that there will be little value for the newly mined coins on the original chain and thus mining there will cease.\n\nHowever, a number of scenarios exist where the original chain retains value, and thus mining on it continues.\n\nWe simply don\'t know -- Bitcoin has never before had a planned contentious hard fork.\n\nWhat is possible is that Bitcoin Classic activation could occur with less than 75% of mining support -- due to faked support marked in the script signature (e.g., https://github.com/xtbit/notbitcoinxt ).   If that happens and the fork happens four weeks later, such that the original chain still has lots of hashing (e.g., 35% of its pre-fork level), mining on the big blocks / hard fork side is risky as the original chain could overtake it and make the big blocks side disappear -- confirmed transactions and all!\n\nWhat is also possible is that miners push Bitcoin Classic to activation without the ecosystem being ready.   So the hard fork happens but only a fraction of the exchanges, wallets, etc, are ready.  Hopefully the majority of miners would not mine a big block \nyet with that happening, but if they did and some exchanges were on BitcoinClassic while most others weren\'t ready -- would be a blood bath for all (except the speculators having a field day at everyone else\'s expense).\n\nBitcoin wasn\'t designed where a contentious hard fork would be accepted by the users.  That situation (where mining continues on the original chain after a hard fork) is called "catastrophic consensus failure".  \n\nBut it is what it is.': 2, "There will be two blockchains if there is a change - a hard fork - that not every miner is using before the change takes effect.\n\nIt won't be two currencies, as transactions posted would eventually be accepted by both chains. The important differences would be when a transaction that would be invalid in one chain - spending the other chains miner fees and bonus, for example - is accepted on the other chain. Most transactions, which would be valid in both chains, would be accepted in both chains. There also would be users running clients that may not have been updated to accept the new fork as valid.\n\nSoon, one chain would prove that it had more miner power using it, and the other would be left behind and abandoned.\n\nIt really isn't a problem. The protocol is built to sort these things out. It would only be a problem if the ratio of supporting vs. non-supporting was closer than about 60/40, and even then the confusion would not last long.": -1, 'This is what the orchestratraitors are trying to achieve... an illusion of two or more competing forks.

Miners won't risk losing money by mining on a dud chain. Unless the numbers are really close, you'll end up reaching 100 on one chain before the other reaches 10. You just want to make sure that you aren't running a client that rejects either fork.\n\nBy the way, your use of a pejorative like  'ClassicCoins' reveals a staggering prejudice.": 1, 'Classic is a pejorative?\n\nYour words, not mine.': 1, "Technically yes, but the real question is it economically possible.

RPC will stop working, but a command line argument can be used to disable this behavior so that RPC still can be used.\n\n> There is no reasonable scenario where we end up with two persistent branches of the Bitcoin block chain.\n\nWhat that means is that you don't believe there is a reasonable scenario where a significant amount of mining (e.g. 25% of the pre-fork level) continues on the original chain.   Let's say Bitcoin Classic release day were today.  If miners were to force it such that it activates a week from now and then four weeks later a big block is mined, do you really believe that the ecosystem will be ready, and that mining using Bitcoin Core will have stopped by then?   ": 1, "By the time 100 confirmations have happened, the game will be over. One chain will be irretrievably dominant, and the other, irrelevant. The first will be 'Bitcoin', and the other will be history.": 1, "> It won't be two currencies, as transactions posted would eventually be accepted by both chains. \n\nFirstly, with dramatically less hashing capacity, blocks will be solved slower.  The original chain -- already near its 1MB/block capacity, and maybe 1/4 the number of blocks after a hard fork, won't confirm many transactions.      The big blocks / hard fork branch with its 2MB/block capacity can take more transactions and will have maybe 4X the number of blocks as the original chain.  \n\nSo right away, the two sides will diverge.\n\nThen once newly mined ClassicCoin is available (i.e., after 100 confirmations and avialable for sale), expect a ton of tainting transactions so as to allow the coins to be spent independently on each side of the fork.    This tainting step guarantees the sides diverge even further, as those transactions with tainted coins will only confirm on the one side.": 1}, ('coinorama.net alternative', 6): {'I have not included the historical data and I have also removed the blocks and network information for now.

They are not ==, yet you say they are both the same thing. See why I can\'t follow? Would be better to say NONE ARE Bitcoin. But let\'s talk about reality.\n\nYour definitions might seem illogical to me because they ignore my main question, regarding reality right now. Right now, this moment in time, what would you call Classic? Not after it starts getting implemented by nodes, not after it gets 75%, right now, before it gets 1%, before a single block is mined by a node running classic? That is actually reality is it not? It can\'t be simply bitcoin or there would be no need for the adjective \'Classic\'. Separate repos, separate names, etc etc. Just because it can talk to other nodes doesn\'t mean all clients are "Bitcoin", it has different DNA. I guess you could call it an incompatible minority client relative to the reference client (it an altcoin)? Parts are compatible sure, but not in total. I mean right now, this moment in time, it\'s vaperware right? It\'s proposed end state is not compatible with the current reality right now. \n\nOK, so (Classic != Bitcoin). So we need to step back.

It's an unfulfilled promise, currently trivial on the global stage.  Some of the necessary technological improvements to allow bitcoin to fulfill its promise require a hard fork for technical reasons.

Even Adam Back CEO of blockstream said he supported it a few months ago before shifting it back on his roadmap.  The issue isn't *if* we hardfork, but simply when.

Want to create a hard fork? Just do it. You don't need anybody's permission.\n\nLet's say you only have 1% of the network hash rate. You release a hard fork update and point your rigs at it. You limp along generating blocks every 1,000 minutes. Stick at it long enough and difficulty will come down to a point where you're back at 10 minute blocks. You might decide to write a one-time reduction in difficult to grease the skids. You might even be able to attract a miner/user following for your alt coin by, for example, by adding new features, fixing bugs, relentless promotion, celebrity endorsements, or some combination.\n\nHowever, your experiment would be in constant danger of sudden annihilation by a hostile miner. A pool with 10% of the Bitcoin network hash power could begin at your branch point and simply undo every transaction your network has confirmed. See, for example:\n\nhttp://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/3472/what-is-the-story-behind-the-attack-on-coiledcoin\n\nSuch an attack would cost you real money, because you could have been directing that mining power at the Bitcoin network, earning block subsidies. Instead, you now have nothing.\n\nIn other words, don't think of a hard fork as a clean switchover to a new network. Think of it as a messy political-technical process that may or may not go according to plan. And the original network has an enormous home-field advantage. So there's every chance the new alt coin will co-exist with Bitcoin - perhaps indefinitely. During that time miners and users may have the ability to switch, resulting in wild exchange rate fluctuations, and other bizarre behavior.\n\nYou and others who see Bitcoin as a store of value could either trade into the confusion, or stand pat waiting for the dust to settle. If you don't want to move your coins to the new network, there's no way to force you - although the weaker fork will always be risky to stay on.\n\nYou can't stop altcoins and you can't stop hard forks.

': 2, 'TL;DR\n\nThe 7 network effects of Bitcoin are:\n\n1. Speculation \xe2\x80\x94 Speculators are attracted to this new asset class by its novelty and high volatility.\n2. Merchant Adoption \xe2\x80\x94 Merchants are attracted by the profit margin increases which Bitcoin enables, namely: avoiding credit card fees and eliminating chargebacks.\n3. Consumer Adoption \xe2\x80\x94 Consumers are attracted by discounts (a la [Purse](https://purse.io/?_r=j0Eysg) for saving on Amazon), increased transaction privacy, and greater economic sovreignty: e.g., the ability to buy restricted or otherwise unavailable goods.\n4. Security \xe2\x80\x94 Insofar as the system is secured by miners and decentralized by nodes the network can be considered trustworthy. Likewise, as more speculators, merchants, and consumers come on board, the price increases and miners are incentivized to participate, further securing the network.\n5. Developer Mindshare - Developers are attracted to Bitcoin because there is money in it, and because its open protocol and codebase enable permissionless innovation.\n6. Financialization - Fintech firms and venture capitalists are investing in the Bitcoin ecosystem not only to facilitate main street investor speculation, but also because its programmable nature allows for the transfer and registry of assets of all types: titles, stocks, securities, etc.\n7. Adoption as a World Reserve Currency - While the previous network effects build upon each other and help to raise its market capitalization, developers continue to enhance Bitcoin\'s scalability and utility. Eventually all transactions may be settled on the blockchain. Adoption as a World Reserve Currency may happen through the gradual recognition of Bitcoin as a technically superior form of money.

We\xe2\x80\x99ve always worked to fix any issues in a responsible and timely manner. When mistakes were made, we owned up to them with public security disclosures, and worked hard to make things right for our users -- not because it was easy, but because it was the right thing to do. It should be noted that we regularly deal with very sophisticated DoS attacks, phishing attempts, and social engineering efforts, and do everything we can to keep our users and their funds safe. Most of the time, no one sees the results of those efforts, and that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. \n\nMany teams don\xe2\x80\x99t have the resources to provide great user support, but we answer all cases within a 2.5-hour average. Whether you\xe2\x80\x99re new to bitcoin or a longtime Blockchain.info user, we do our best to answer all questions asked of us. User privacy has been one of the core foundations of our Company. We believe in open networks and open access for all. That\xe2\x80\x99s why when you sign up for a wallet at Blockchain.info, the only requirement is a strong password with the option to add an email address.

While the coins could be made effectively untraceable with one transaction, it would still be obvious that they'd been moved.  \n\nNow if Satoshi's coins moved, there would be a large effort to discover just who Satoshi is/was by tracking the coins.  That might be effectively impossible, but people would still try.  \n\nMore importantly, people would be wondering WHY Satoshi decided to move his coins.  That brings up the possibility that Satoshi either wants to spend his coins or sell them, either one could have major implications for the price of Bitcoin.  This would set off a huge debate that could reduce the price of Bitcoin even if Satoshi has no intent of selling.\n\nMy guess is that Satoshi will keep his coins for several more years, until the point where nobody cares anymore what he does with them...": 9, 'Unless he already owns Tesla...

I at least would find that pretty uninteresting.\n\nSatoshi can just create one-time-use addresses, move his coin around, tumble through different services/mixers/coinjoin/etc, and after sometime use the coins somewhere. Users would notice the initial movement, but soon lose the track.\n\nEdit: also, there are privacy-oriented altcoins such as monero (ring signatures) and soon zooko's zcash. I don't know how these work but at least they are advertising anonymity. It would be very effortless for satoshi to just sell his stash slowly to monero or whatever, hold for some time and then sell back to bitcoin, using shapeshift and similar services.

You have the bitcoin as an asset that can be leveraged. You can pay the loan using said bitcoin (requiring moves/cashout) or you could use the money from your day job, other liquidity, or assets that can be made liquid.\n\nOut of curiosity, what makes you think Satoshi cares if people see him cash out or move coins?\n\n": 1, "First, you have to understand this is a Satoshi-specific problem.  There are a lot of coins in very early wallets that have gone untouched for years.  Lots of people have done analysis on these and concluded that several of them are most likely Satoshi's coins.  Thus, if ANYthing happens to these coins, it will be front page news.  \n\nThis problem doesn't apply to others, just Satoshi.  Tracking any other individual wallet is a lot harder.  \n\nIf I were Satoshi and I wanted a Tesla, I'd pick the very latest address I had, something that wasn't on the list of 'probable satoshi wallets' and spend that.
