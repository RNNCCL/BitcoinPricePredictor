That's a separate operation from monetary policy.": 1, "Actually, the NY Fed did run the auctions and issue the bonds for the Treasury Department. I think they still do. The Fed basically acts as the commercial and investment bank for the US gov.  The GSE's use the investment banks to issue their debt. It's a huge business for the investment banks. After the debt is issued in the auction, then the Fed buys it back, via repo and also outright (QE) via OMO. \n\nOne reason why all the banks were centered down around Wall Street was that before the days of fully electronic trading you literally had to run your govie orders to the Fed's window down on Liberty Street (how ironic) across the street from (now JP) Chase.  When I was a young lad at the Giant Squid, the elders on our trading desk used to tell us younglings stories about how they (as junior staff) would get assigned as either phone or runner on auction days. Phone would go grab the nearest pay phone to the Fed with a pocket full of change and park on it keeping the line open to the trading desk to save time and the runner would wait for the orders and run them to the Fed window. Old school. ": 1, '> The Fed does create money, in the form of debt issuance that is snapped up by the primary dealers in the treasuries/bond markets. \n\nI\'m afraid that isn\'t how it works.  The Treasury Department and Government Sponsored Entities issue debt in the course of funding the government or lending on mortgages.  The Fed buys this debt from banks by crediting the accounts the banks have with them.  This is called "open market operations", since the Fed buys the debt on the open market.\n\nBanks can apply their Fed balances to their reserve requirement, which means they are allowed to make loans elsewhere.  They can also request circulating notes (paper dollars) if they have need of some for daily operations (i.e. tellers and ATMs have given out too much).\n\nWhen the Fed buys debt, it aquires an asset (the debt it now holds) and a liability (the amount credited to the selling bank), so their books balance.  Unlike regular banks, though, the Fed has no minimum reserve requirement, despite "reserve" being part of their name.  So they are leveraged to an absurd degree, 500:1 or so.  It\'s not like some regulator is going to shut them down - they **are** the regulator.': 2, "It already is a world currency since it's the only currency I can use all over the world. \n\nBitcoin is accepted in more countries than the US dollar.": 11, 'Seems the economist agrees with me:\n\n>To carry out QE central banks create money by buying securities, such as government bonds, from banks, with electronic cash that did not exist before.\n\nThe Fed runs the central banking system in the USA, therefore, the Fed is ultimately creating money for their programs.\n\nReference: http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/03/economist-explains-5': 1, 'Bullshit on gold not having a practical use, try electronics.

There have been a few places that stopped their business altogether, i.e. they closed down entirely, although we doubt this was due to a lack of Bitcoin customers :)\n\n> How big is the Bitcoin community there?\n\nHard to tell from the payments alone (Bitcoin being anonymous and all) but we know for a fact there is a small group (a few dozen) of hardcore users and enthusiast, a growing number of newcomers who are interested, and from time to time we see visitors from other places (or even other countries) visiting Arnhem to spend some time and bitcoins.\n\n> The Bitcoin meetup group seems to be quite small?\n\nActually, there are typically more people present at the meetups than RSVP'd on the page. But the meetup group is not fully representative for the number of users here. People from outside Arnhem often come and visit the meetups, and by far not all users from within Arnhem attend the meetups.\n\n> What's the incentive for the shop-owners there to accept Bitcoin? \n\nFree publicity, new customers bringing more business, it generates attention, it's a form of customer service (customers have more ways to pay), attractive for visitors and tourists. Saves them money (it's the only payment method that is 100% free), they're part of something new and fun and revolutionary, and for anyone interested in the idealistic side of Bitcoin, it helps growing an alternative financial system that is no longer depending on (and monopolized by) banks.\n\nMoreover, by using our Bitcoin payment processing service [BitKassa](https://www.bitkassa.nl/) which we developed mainly for this purpose, it's *extremely* easy for them and takes away all the downsides anyone could think of. Zero investment (it works immediately on any device, no app required), no concerns about safety or security, free of charge (unlike PIN / debit card payments), extremely user friendly, zero knowledge required (this solution really is as fool-proof as it gets), and if they let it convert to euros automatically there is also zero volatility risk. Moreover their money is transmitted the same day, 365 days a year (again unlike PIN / debit card payments). \n\nThey're not bound by any contract or obligation. We just ask them to give this a try (even if it's just for one month or one week) and if it doesn't work out for them or they dislike it for whatever reason, they can quit any day. None of them have, so far.\n\n> How do you convince them?\n\nIt's a simple trade off. Pros: many, see above. Cons: absolutely NONE. Seriously, I think with our approach (the BitKassa solution) there is absolutely *no* reason why anyone would NOT want to accept Bitcoin. \n\nWe always have to deal with some initial scepticism (if it sounds too good to be true...) but as soon as we get anyone to at least give it a try, they're typically aboard and there is no reason at all to quit.\n\n> Do you have Bitcoin ATMs there?\n\nWe used to have 2, but unfortunately due to technical problems they have both been out of order for quite a while and eventually were taken offline. \n\nWe hope to get a new ATM placed, and we'll surely mention this on the [Arnhem Bitcoincity website](http://www.arnhembitcoinstad.nl/) when it's available. In the mean time we recommend using Mycelium Trader where you can buy bitcoins with cash in person.
