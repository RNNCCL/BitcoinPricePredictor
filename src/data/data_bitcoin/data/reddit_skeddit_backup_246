Thank you for your understanding.': 1, 'great reporting! /u/changetip 7 mBTC': 2, 'It was a press release, so only the PR firm is paid. The news outlets merely pass it along "as-is". \n\nIn this particular case, even with validation of the source and content, it was coming from a PR firm and the company actually does exist in Vanuatu who hosts many banks and financial services. So it actually looks legit on the surface.\n\nThe original press release came from PR News Wire (http://www.prnewswire.com/) which is not industry-specific.\n\nHowever, one of the above listed outlets actually did take the press release and made it into a story of their own. ': 3, 'Paincoin ;)': 1, 'Our response to the information published at dinbits is as follows:\n\t\nLayer #1, The 25 million:\n10 mil. US dollars are enough to get an International Bank License in\nVanuatu and launch what we are going to launch. We are going to sell only 100,000 shares for $100 each, then launch the bank in Vanuatu (it is only necessary to have $500,000 in cash in the bank to obtain a banking license in Vanuatu).\n\nLayer #2 - The Countries:\nOur website states that "Representation offices will be launched in 7 countries". We are not going to launch banks and obtain banking license\nin all countries. A representation office does not require a local banking license. We are also not going to provide the same banking services that\nlocally licensed banks can provide. You will find that many banks have Representation offices worldwide. This doesn\'t require huge investments. A representation office can be 2 people in a small office who are responsible for the identification of customers - nothing else, no local marketing and no local business.\n\nThe bank is not only going to offer Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency solutions. You can have a look on the website and see that our solutions will be for much more then only Cryptocurrency traders. \n\nLayer #3 - No Compliance:\nThis is completely incorrect. We have people with 5, 8 and 12 years\' experience in banking compliance. We are in touch with the Vanuatu authorities and fully comply with global standards for AML and KYC. Also, our website says: "You will need a Passport, Proof of Address and will need to have a Live Interview". Do you need much more to open bank account with most offshore and even local banks? No.\n\nLayer #4 - The Languages:\nOur website and online banking will be translated and supported in 50 languages. The main languages are English and  French (the 2 official languages in Vanuatu).\n\nLayer #5 - Twitter:\nWe have paid several social marketing companies and PR agencies. One of them is responsible for Twitter and Facebook. We have just launched and it is unclear for me why we have so many Twitter followers. I hope they are real followers and not just a "boost" just to show us the "great results" of their job.\n\nLayer #6 - The Website Itself:\nThe website is matter of taste. Personally, I like it. Do you like Windows? Do you prefer Apple? It\'s up to you. The Shareholder Portal also works well. It lets you follow news and dinbits has no shares, so it doesn\'t have access to the Shareholder Portal (ID and PIN) - we don\'t understand how they can comment on this if it works or not. Press Centre has to have content (press releases) and should not be nice. It\'s very simple, very easy to read and copy-paste.\n\nLayer #6.1 - Lack Thereof 1 (Languages):\nYes. At this stage it makes no sense to translate it into 50 languages. What for? We believe most visitors understand English and if not - they\ncan use Google Translate. Banking is what needs 50 languages, not a temporary landing page, which will be updated as soon as our project is funded.\n\nLayer #6.2 - Domain Age:\nFunding started in October and we have stated this in our press release. Our main domain nextbank.vu was registered on October 13th.\n\nLayer #6.3 - Lack Thereof 2 (Security):\nThe bank needs 3-factor authentication and it will have it. At the current stage - where do you expect us to have 3-factor authentication? To enter the website? :D\n\nLayer #7 - The Founder:\nDim Voloshinsky (in Latvian: Dmitrijs Volosinskis) is the founder, and the head of the project and will be a majority Shareholder. There is nothing to hide here either. He lives in London. He loves Vanuatu. He is the  director and owner of Instaglobal Limited and Instaglobal Limited is the operator of Bitcoins123.com, which works perfectly, and several thousands of customers Have used Bitcoins123.com since its launch in April 2015.\nThe CEO will be the ex-CEO of one of the private banks in Vanuatu. The compliance and risk management team is almost formed and most people have significant experience in banking, much more experience then Dim Voloshinsky himself, as you understand. I exist and Dinbits can meet me in person if they want. :)\n\nThe Verdict:\nWe will see NextBank open and running in 2016.\n\nYou can contact me by email press@nb.vu': 1, "That is exactly what is happening here, people warn other people. \nAnd still if someone chooses to blindly invest in such scheme without doing proper research he deserves the right to make a stupid mistake and learn from it.

One of the prerequisites for this license is experience (they generally like to see 10 years) of which you have absolutely none. \n\nSecondly, the length of time for this to possibly come to fruition is going to be 4 to 6 months. It\'s going to take you at least 6 to 8 weeks to get the mountain of necessary paperwork in place and delivered with all of the trimmings that go along with it and then Vanuatu has 4 months to conduct their review before they ultimately decline. This of course, is after the million is obtained, of which you not only have to secure the $500,000, but the additional fees of about $24,000 for other required registrations and license fees. \n\nSo this pipe dream of a license by December as you have claimed is not even possible.\n\nThis is, of course, is not to mention the legal and setup fees.

This is because we do not make baseless claims, we spend copious amounts of time and resources looking into claims before blowing the whistle. All of which goes to show you are either perpetrating a scam or you are so foolish that you actually do not realize how badly this would fail and blow up in your face if it ever made it past tomorrow.

If this is the case, then bitcoin will become the global digital reserve currency.': 3, 'I recently spoke with Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, whose new company Gemini offers a licensed and regulated exchange for bitcoin, the digital currency that has exploded in popularity (and skepticism) in recent years.\n\nHere\'s a transcript of our conversation, lightly edited and condensed. \n\n**Q: I buy a lot of stuff online. I have nothing to hide, but care about my privacy. I really have no problems with the current payment system. My biggest question about Bitcoin is that I\'m still not sure what problem it solves for me. Where am I wrong?**\n\n\n**A:** People had the same questions about the Internet 20 years ago -- how is this going to affect my life? The truth is, in the short-term it very well may not. But in the long-run, it will in more profound ways that any of us can imagine.\n\nBitcoin is Internet money. It is money purpose-built for the Internet. Credit cards and ACH, on the other hand, are payment systems that were invented in the 1950\'s and 60\'s before the Internet even existed.\n\nUsing them on the Internet is like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole. Bitcoin is a money protocol that has transformed money into packets that now travel over the Internet, not the balkanized rails of the legacy banking system.\n\nIf we look at how other protocols have affected our lives, we can start to see a glimpse of Bitcoin\'s potential. Think, for instance, about how email protocols such as IMAP and SMTP changed the way we send mail or voice protocols like VoIP changed the way we make phone calls. You send an email today instead of a postcard or make a call around the world on Skype virtually for free because of the invention of these protocols.\n\nBitcoin\'s utility lies in the eye of the beholder. In the first world, Bitcoin will make its first dent as a settlement mechanism, not as a payment system that helps you buy a cup of coffee. Paper, middlemen, and cumbersome back office operations will go the way of the dodo.\n\nIn other parts of the world, Bitcoin will have a different immediate meaning. Payment systems may not appear "broken" through a first world prism, but they are by no means efficient and borderless. Try sending money to someone in Sri Lanka, for instance. Credit cards are only really popular in about eight to 10 developed countries and expanding the existing network is costly and infrastructure-heavy. Similar to how developing countries leapfrogged the installation of telephone poles and landlines with the adoption of cellular phones, Bitcoin will allow them to skip forward to a next generation, Internet-centric payments network without waiting for legacy networks to arrive that have little interest and/or ability to service them anytime soon.\n\nIn countries like Argentina, where the national currency is habitually debased, bitcoin will be seen as a better store of value and celebrated for its gold-like qualities. For citizens looking to circumvent draconian capital controls in search of greener pastures, bitcoin will represent their chance to exit.\n\nUltimately, however, Bitcoin will fundamentally change the way humans and machines exchange value.\n\nComputers can\'t open up a bank account at Wells Fargo, but they can plug into protocols. This, in addition to the fact that it is practicable to transfer fractions of pennies over the Bitcoin network or other blockchains built on top of it, will enable lightweight economic transactions that the existing payments system will never be able to facilitate, let alone contemplate. As a result, Bitcoin will create new avenues of human-to-machine and machine-to-machine trade that were previously not possible and usher in the first forms of artificial life.\n\nIn the future, you will summon an autonomous agent (self-driving car, drone) to pick you up and take you to your destination. You will be able to pay your fare in bitcoin, which an agent will happily accept, and you will also use bitcoin to pay other agents such as roads for road-space or other self-driving cars to move out of your way if you want to go faster.\n\nIt\'s fun and easy to come up with endless examples of what is now possible. Bitcoin will bring the Internet of Things to life, making devices not just smart but also intelligent (i.e., rational economic actors). As the invention of money itself fundamentally evolved the circuitry of the human brain, programmable money will rewire the neurological pathways of the Internet forever.\n\n**Q: So where is Bitcoin 10 and 20 years from now? What\'s the bullish scenario, and what probability do you put on this being a fad?**\n\n\n**A:** Bitcoin will replace gold. In the scheme of the universe, gold and other precious metals are not even *remotely* finite. In fact, there are asteroid databases that estimate the composition and profit of mining over 600,000 asteroids in our solar system and it turns out that earth\'s chemical elements are quite abundant when you look at the larger picture. Once we achieve cheap access to space, which seems like a real possibility in the next decade or two, gold will no longer be scarce. The only fixed, commodity-like asset with money-like qualities left will be bitcoin.\n\nToday, bitcoin is already a better gold. Taking into account the nine characteristics of money -- scarcity, durability, portability, divisibility, verifiability, storability, fungibility, difficulty to counterfeit, and adoption -- bitcoin matches or beats gold across the board in every category. The only thing gold has on bitcoin right now is a 10,000 year first-mover advantage -- but there is no divine reason why gold couldn\'t eventually be replaced in the free market by a synthetic digital gold that was engineered to have superior qualities. That being said, first-mover advantages are powerful so it may take until asteroid probes confirm empirically and incontrovertibly that gold is in fact plentiful (which may not be that long from now), for bitcoin to unseat gold.\n\nNot only could bitcoin replace precious metals in an investment portfolio, its upside potential might be even greater.\n\nBitcoin is not just an asset. It is also a protocol and a global network similar to the Internet itself, but for exchanging value. If you own bitcoin, you own a piece of the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. It\'s like owning an asset that tracks the entire Bitcoin market. This is not the case if you own gold, you do not also own a piece of the mining and services sector, for instance. This was also not the case with the original Internet -- you couldn\'t go out and directly buy a piece of it. Bitcoin is very different, you don\'t have to bother sorting the winners from the losers, there is little chance a Bitcoin company succeeds and bitcoin doesn\'t. Owning bitcoin is not just owning a better gold, it is also like owning a call option on the most exciting technology space and innovation in the world today.\n\nThe probability of bitcoin being a fad seems low. The Bitcoin blockchain is the most secure, permissionless, decentralized public ledger in the world. Anyone presented with the choice will chose to build and entrust their data on the Bitcoin blockchain because it is leaps and bounds more secure than the next most secure blockchain of its kind. As a result, there are significant network effects and first-mover advantages at play here in favor of Bitcoin. If it is a winner-take all landscape, which it is looking like it increasingly is, then the Bitcoin blockchain could be the core foundation on top of which most digital currencies and digital currency applications are built. If this is the case, then bitcoin will become the global digital reserve currency.\n\n**Q: What are Bitcoin\'s biggest problems, and how does Gemini solve them?**\n\n \n**A:** Bitcoin\'s biggest bottleneck right now is a lack of regulated on-ramps. Companies that want to comply, can\'t comply, because they haven\'t been told how to. Such uncertainty is arresting in the financial world and has severely limited the traditional economy\'s ability to interact with the Bitcoin economy and help grow it.\n\nThe world\'s leading economies tend to also be of the most regulated, and as a result, their financial institutions (i.e. hedge funds, banks) simply can\'t or won\'t do business with businesses that are not yet fully regulated. The large exception is China, where Bitcoin companies have to date been able to integrate with the traditional financial system. Unsurprisingly, 80% of all bitcoin trading volume today is happening in China.\n\nWhen we founded Gemini, our vision from the start was simple: build a bridge into the Bitcoin economy that both individuals and institutions can use. Our principles were, and still are, pretty straightforward: 1. Become licensed in the U.S. under a regulatory framework that allows us to service both individual and institutional customers. 2. Do not operate until such licensing has been achieved (ask for permission not forgiveness). 3. Establish a U.S. banking relationship so customer fiat funds are eligible for FDIC insurance and never leave the country. 4. Build our tech stack with a security-first mentality from day one. 5. Hire only the A-team. 6. Keep hiring only the A-team.\n\nWe believe we have stayed true to our principles and as a result think Gemini stands to be a significant long-term Bitcoin catalyst. If Bitcoin is going to go mainstream on a global scale, Bitcoin entrepreneurs are going to have fill in the critical pieces of the Bitcoin infrastructure puzzle. We think we\'ve started to do that with Gemini and look forward to helping build the future of money for years to come.': 27, "Well frankly it's post scarcity come true.

I think it may replace gold for a portion of a hedge portfolio, but there is still nothing that will entirely replace a physical commodity that is a store of value should the lights go off. \n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm very bullish and have a lot of Bitcoin on cold wallets, but to say that it will *replace* gold is silly.

The point is that confidence in gold is dramatically going to wane because soon, if not already, we will be able to imagine -- and that is the key word, 'imagine' -- a day when technology obliterates the scarcity feature of gold. It doesn't matter how we get there, be it asteroids or nanotechnology, or whatever people are talking about these days, the point is that we will be able to imagine some technology coming around that changes the assumption that gold is scarce. Once that happens, gold can no longer function as money. \n\nPut simply, gold can never be certain against technology, Bitcoin can. That is the point, and that is why confidence in gold will rapidly erode. Whether or not it literally remains scarce doesn't matter so much because it is confidence that gives money value.

I fail to see how companies failing to "involve Bitcoin" somehow adds to the value of Bitcoin automatically.  It\'s very likely some add value, some are neutral, and some detract from the value of Bitcoin.\n\nBut you can\'t explain it, which I think is clear this is just a massive assumption that anything involving Bitcoin somehow is beneficial.  I guess that spam attack was "beneficial" for Bitcoin because it "increased adoption" or something.\n': 2, "So this is anecdotal, but I think this article is somewhat accurate. My communication with VCs is that they are looking for more traditional fundamentals from bitcoin companies vs. shoot for the moon concepts since it's becoming apparent that bitcoin is not going to achieve mainstream in 2 years. This means more investment focus on companies like Coinbase and 21 that are making money now and less on advanced bitcoin tech that requires the space to evolve at a rate that it has not. For example, there are several vc backed companies that focus on being multi-sig oracles. Bitgo is an example of this. How can those companies continue to gain investment if they can't forecast a plan to turn a profit in three years and how can they make the millions of dollars they need to when only a handful of bitcoin companies are seeing serious volume? How much can they charge their 10 large volume customers? Certainly not half a million a year each.\n\nVCs focus on hockey stick growth and the fact is we aren't seeing that in bitcoin right now. Yes, bitcoin is still growing in transaction volume.

I started reading your reply and really loved it. I agree with most of what you say and think it\'s super well thought out and based in fact, which I love. Totally agree that VCs are shying away from \'shoot for the moon\' concepts/companies right now and that Bitcoin is at least 2 years away from gaining more mainstream adoption. I do however, disagree with you on your BitGo comments. Obviously, as the Director of Growth Marketing at BitGo, I certainly have some biases. However, I also know from being on the inside at the company, we take security very seriously and we all know that if there is another Mt. Gox- like breach, it would really hurt the ecosystem as a whole. We couldn\'t be more committed to ensuring that never happen. I\'m also not at all convinced that companies like Coinbase are in fact, profitable. I think companies and especially investors need to put less emphasis on "immediate" profitability when it comes to Bitcoin. If that is the impetus for their investment, there will be a lot of disappointment - at least for the next 2 years. Building transformative products and figuring out how this technology can change the world for the better, should come first.

Even if it only becomes more appealing to the 1% who could make use of it,  the adoption rate would increase for a long time to come.

To me it's that valuable. \n\nThen here is how you can make it more valuable: Increase its circulation. Right now we produce and distribute a little over 40k issues every three months. Let's double that. 80k issues every three months is twice as valuable as 40k every three months.\n\nWe can accomplish this by getting more distribution deals at big events, but there are only so many events and only so much time. We can also accomplish this by recruiting more small distributors. These can be individuals who order a case (30, I think) and take upon themselves the responsibility to make sure they get into the right hands. There are quite a few individuals and groups who already do this, but there could always be more.\n\nWhich is why I asked you to let people know they can get a copy of yBitcoin delivered straight to their door by the printer, for free, just by subscribing online. Make sure a copy winds up in your Doctor's/Dentist's waiting room, every issue. Make sure that investment group meetup you're a member of sees an issue. Make sure your boss gets an issue.

However that said, the likelihood of the price increasing in the interim between payment and cash out is just as likely as it is to decrease, which would benefit your clients. If your clients understand the risks they can make more informed decisions themselves. The price has been more stable over the last year or so, but daily swings of 5% are possible. Typical daily volatility is about 2% I\'d say off the top of my head. Still beats PayPal. \n\nThe risk can be mitigated by your process. If they set up an account on the exchange of their choice, you could directly fund their account there. Some exchanges have automatic features that could further help.\n\nhttps://m.btcxindia.com/\n\nhttps://coinage.ph/\n\nhttps://www.coinhako.com/\n\nHttps://localbitcoins.com\n\nI don\'t endorse these, they are just for further research. \n\n\n2) Yes. That could be a concern on smaller exchanges. Most exchanges can handle typical "pay check" amounts with no problem at all. But if the amounts you are talking about are "project budget" amounts, there could be issues.\n\n3) Not currently that I know of, but that\'s a good idea. Bitwage.com might be the closest thing to that.\n\nThere are also bitcoin atms popping up everywhere. You could send them btc and they could go to an atm to withdraw the cash. Remember PayPal has fees and atms have fees too (usually 5% or there abouts).

That is a huge step because it means that social organization is now an information technology (to the degree that bitcoin and like technologies are actually adopted).\n\nBut the old problems of technology integration hold back bitcoin (like many other technologies).  Its not that we can't find technical solutions.  We have lots of them.  The bottleneck is people, and non-technological decision making, implementation, and communication.\n\nWe do have efficient ways to evolve systems.  It starts by adopting a technical approach and a common platform.  There have been lots of attempts, such as Java, the CLR, and now HTML5/JavaScript.  I am hoping actually something like bitcoin could become popular but based on web assembly, so we could have like an npm for blockchain/other stuff, and just include the core modules we need.  If someone publishes an improved version to the registry it would be instantly able to be pulled in and used (from many programming languages and platforms) if it was better.  If there is an upgrade to a core protocol, everyone just pulls the new version.\n\nThe way we integrate applications now and generally make common APIs is something like REST which is really not a very semantic or deep way to integrate, and relying on that and text documents like BIPs or RFCs to specify interfaces and implementation etc. means that people have to do quite a lot of basic translation work from natural language into many different programming languages etc., which ends up repeating quite a lot of effort and is very slow and prone to error.

Exploitation is only possible under conditions of violence. When people have choices of where to place their money, the producer will always serve the consumer.

It is specifically Statism that removes consequence. When kings, cops, judges, oligarchs and bureaucrats can simply steal their way to profit and threaten force if you resist them, they can spend, kill, rape, pillage, terrorize, take, rob, steal, extort, invade, torture, and exploit without thought of consequence, without fear of reprisal or any kind of justice against them. They are secure in knowing that the protection of a uniform, black dress, corporate legal immunity, and the fact that the money is not their own and the loss is passed onto the hostage population. This is the most uncivilized form of social organization imaginable, where a predatory class has enslaved the population that is at their mercy and immune from the consequences of their crimes against humanity.\n\nNotice in America, it is where they govern most, the Cities (where government LIVES), that represents the worst of human civilization. The most economic ruin, rape, murder, crime, violence, theft, homelessness, joblessness, poverty, disease, moral decay, etc. This is the chaos that kings breed.\n\nStatism is simply the belief in the moral legitimacy or efficiency of human slavery. Historically the nation state was born from slavery itself and kings were considered to have divine providence to rule man with legions of violent enforcers. Can you imagine a scenario where you would be incorruptible despite having legions of enforcers at your disposal to turn your commands and scribble into acts of violence?\n\nResearch: Voluntaryism\n\nPointing guns and threatening violence to solve complex social problems is the antithesis of a civilized society. Just imagine if you attempted to bring this philosophy into your daily life, the natural consequences would ruin you and you would be considered an antisocial criminal, yet somehow kingship and costumes change this? Nope.\n\nDo you own yourself? When someone can threaten overwhelming violence to extract your honest living, seize your possessions, or cage you like some wild beast, what\'s to stop them from having you pick the cotton?\n\nVoting is the assumption that you own your neighbors and can force a slave master over their life. While you vote with a ballot, the parasites of the world vote with our dollar.': 1, '"They have a leader with 90% approval rating"\n\nIn an system with basically no alternative media and state indoctrination in every aspect of life, thats not very surprising.

Anton Siluanova Office has developed amendments to the Criminal Code, under which offenders would be jailed for four years. Earlier, the Ministry of Finance offered a lighter sentence for the issuance and circulation of cryptocurrency - a fine of up to 500 thousand. Rubles, or correctional labor for up to two years. This "News" told in the press service of the Ministry of Finance. The Ministry of Economic Development, which supports this initiative, noted that the bill will be submitted to the Ministry of Finance by the Government to the State Duma in the coming months.\n\nIn late September, the Ministry of Finance proposed to introduce criminal penalties for the production and trafficking cryptocurrency in Russia, considering them money substitutes (prohibited by law "On the Central Bank"). Criminal proposed add a new article "The turnover of money substitutes": in the manufacture, acquisition cryptocurrency the purpose of sale, as well as sales of the Ministry of Finance proposed a fine of 500 thousand. Rubles or the salary and other income for the period to two years, community service up 480 hours, or correctional labor for up to two years. Office clearly drifted to the Bitcoin monetary surrogates, identifying their turnover illegal financial operations. \nAccording to a source at the Finance Ministry, now the issue of punishment for Bitcoins decided to tighten.\n\nPerhaps this decision prompted the agency plans to produce cryptocurrency companies. Qiwi September 2015 announced the development of its counterpart Bitcoin - bitrubley. As told "Izvestia", the press service of the company, it is expected that in 2016 bitrublyami can pay for the services (eg, mobile communications) through Qiwi-purse. CEO and co-owner Sergei SOLONIN said that when you start to use kriptotehnologiya blockchain, in which the system works Bitcoin.\n\nRepresentatives of the Central Bank in the past year indicated that believe Bitcoin money substitutes. But this summer, the first deputy chairman Georgi Luntovsky declared that "it is impossible to deny this tool, it is possible for him the future." And in September 2015 deputy chairman Olga Skorobogatov said at a forum in Kazan, the regulator has established a working group to study the technology blockchain based on international experience. Perhaps the Central Bank showed great loyalty to Bitcoins after in 2015 the Bank of England announced plans to create its own digital currency Bitcoin and compared the occurrence of the birth of the Internet.\n\nBut cryptocurrency act strongly against the security forces, for example, the Federal Service for Drug Control (FDCS) stated that Bitcoins among other payment systems are actively used by drug trafficking in the drug trade. As noted by representatives of the service, Federal Drug Control Service\'s position on this issue has not changed. Against cryptocurrency act Prosecutor General\'s Office, Interior Ministry and FSB.\n\nIn 2014 its intention to introduce penalties for the use of cryptocurrency stated deputies from the "Fair Russia".\n\n- Cryptocurrency jeopardize financial stability and fiscal sovereignty of Russia, - says Duma deputy Andrei Krutov. - Have enough uncertainty in the market and it is not necessary to using such a situation, people were trying to save money in Bitcoin, and then turned into deceived depositors. We have developed a bill to impose liability for use cryptocurrency, and the other day he will be formally submitted to the Duma.\n\nA source close to the Central Bank, said "Izvestia" that the final position of the Central Bank will become clear from the analysis of the functioning of the working group cryptocurrency Central Bank, in the study of this issue is involved Rosfinmonitoring. Close to the agency source said that an increased risk of trafficking cryptocurrency points FATF (the international Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering - Financial Action Task Force, which is a party, and Russia). According to the source, FATF considers that the main risks are related to the anonymity of transactions cryptocurrency. The source said that in all recent reports FATF says about this issue.\n\nAmong the opponents cryptocurrency and Economic Development.\n\n- By monetary surrogates, including cryptocurrency, no software and is legally bound by them actors - he told "Izvestia" Elena Lashkina, Assistant Minister of Economic Development Alexei Ulyukayev. - Operations on them are speculative in nature, are carried out on the so-called "virtual stock exchanges" and carry a high risk of significant changes in value. The use of surrogates, including cryptocurrency, associated with a high level of risk, primarily due to their unsecured assets, lack of uniform regulation of release and is legally bound by them subject. The anonymous nature of the production of money substitutes, including cryptocurrency, unlimited range of actors creates the preconditions for involving citizens and companies in the illegal activity, including the legalization (laundering) of proceeds from crime and terrorist financing.\n\nElena Lashkina added that the use of money surrogates, including cryptocurrency, as a means of payment and savings may infringe the rights involved in their turnover conscientious individuals as holders of money substitutes because of their anonymity and virtuality are unable to defend their interests in judicial or administrative proceedings .\n\nChairman of the board of the agency "Financial Innovations" Roman Prokhorov (previously headed the department of the national payment system of the Central Bank) said that the only chance for the legal circulation cryptocurrency in Russia - the establishment of clear rules for their treatment with the elimination of anonymity.\n\n- But if you bring your rules for handling cryptocurrency to regulation of existing tools, it eliminates the significant benefits cryptocurrency as a convenient tool for users, - says Roman Prokhorov.\n\nThe deputy chairman of the National Council of Financial Market Alexander Naumov confident that the risks of using cryptocurrency in illegal operations is much higher when they are banned than it in exchange for a limited ability to use Bitcoins state can gain control of the transaction. He believes that the limited resolution cryptocurrency in Russia will reduce the risks of serious crimes related to their use.\n\nBut the chief analyst Natalia Shilov Binbanka warns that actually cryptocurrency not provided nothing at all (no gold reserves, nor of the economy given country), that is, can grow into a classic pyramid, without any responsibility for it on the part of the creators.\n\nAccording to the lawyer, Nina Eremina, taking into account the positions of participating in the discussion of government agencies chances of adoption of the amendments the Ministry of Finance are high.\n\n- It must be emphasized that the ban on direct appeal cryptocurrency, production of which is produced in Russia, the law on the Central Bank does not set - like a senior lawyer of "Yukov and Partners" Irina Adamova. - Before the corresponding changes for the criminalization of trafficking cryptocurrency seems premature. Violators should be punished according to the article. 174 of the Criminal Code ("Legalization (laundering) of money or other property acquired by other persons by criminal means").\n\n': 19, "Forgive me if I'm incorrect, but didn't the initial bitcoin Boom come as a result of Corsica or Crete or some shitty Mediterranean island's banks shutting down and all the Russian mob and politicians moved their money into bitcoin there?

The cops don't typically pull people over for speeding when everyone is doing it, but the fact remains that *they can if they want to.* So if you simply look at them the wrong way, or express your displeasure at their existence by use of a hand signal, they will invoke their discretionary power to stomp on you.
