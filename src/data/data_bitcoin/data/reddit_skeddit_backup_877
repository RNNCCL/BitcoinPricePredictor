I'm not sure how often they go to the exchange (surely not once per transaction, but maybe multiple times a day).

If overall, they can only sell _some_ of that $324.99 in Bitcoin, then there is a surplus of Bitcoin and the price goes down (as it has been).\n\nTo try to answer your question: are these the 'whales'?  Probably not.  Their transactions on the exchanges (done privately) are likely the 'same' as everyone elses transactions, just larger.  I.e. they are not making bets against the market.": 2, "Aah I see.\n\nSo, much of it has to do with timing as well as proof/accountability/effort.\n\nSo first there's timing. Generally when a card is fraudulently used, it becomes clear quite quickly, at times before the product is shipped or when the product arrives (shipments can be cancelled mid-shipping and returned.) This means that when one buys gold, the gold may be shipped two days later, heavy as it is not through the post but through a heavier package which is slower to arrive, which then arrives days later. This means that if the vendor is alerted to the fraud, the shipment can be cancelled. This reduces the risk and provides an extra level of difficulty for the fraudster.\n\nNext is proof of shipment of bitcoin versus a physical product. It starts with the fact that when a company claims a user bought bitcoin, that it has few ways to prove this in the court of law. You can show the debit card was used, but how to prove it was done by the user and not someone who stole the card? This indeed is quite difficult. Thus when a fraudulent user charges back the transaction and says they didn't buy it, they now have the bitcoin and their money back, and the vendor is out of luck.\n\nWith gold, this isn't as much of a problem. For one, a shipping address must be posted. One thing that can be done is that the vendor requires the address to be similar to the address linked to the payment card. But even if not, this still provides an avenue for authorities to find out who did receive the package, either the fraudulent user or someone who stole the card. A policy of 'no post-office boxes' is very common, so that the gold can only be shipped to an actual home registered to an actual person, and not some anonymous post box. This goes a long way to prevent fraud, or catch a fraudster.\n\nAnd secondly, there's the proof of shipment. Not sure what the system is in the US, priority mail, secured shipping, registered mail? In any case, this shipment requires the recipient to show their ID and sign it off to the delivery man. This way, only the person linked to the payment card can receive the package. Not used for a shipment of a pizza, always used for a shipment of precious metals. This way, there is no way anyone but the rightful owner of the payment card can receive the package, as ID must be shown, and increasingly common is that the delivery man requires a 5 cent payment with the same card as was used for the purchase, to prove ownership of that card.\n\nNone of this applies to bitcoin as there is no shipping or identity verification involved. This is what exchanges do, they verify your identity and your bank account linked to your identity, then whenever someone sends money from that bank to the exchange, they have the proof to show that this wasn't done by a hacker. Some companies like Circle also allow you to verify your identity and link your card and verify it say with a small payment up to $50, and then let you buy up to $1k the month after when it's sure the card wasn't stolen.\n\nOf course, any company could sell bitcoin vouchers. i.e., instead of sending bitcoin to your wallet, they sent a registered mail with a bitcoin voucher to your home, and require you to show ID + the payment card to the delivery man. Then you can use that voucher online and redeem your bitcoin. This way the vendor can go to the court with proof (the registered mail signature from the post company) to show the chargeback was fraudulent if the user charges back his money after. But no company really does that as it's a bit of a hassle and counterintuitive to a digital currency. \n\nSo in short, some companies allow it but up to small amounts of money because the risk is high, because it's not easy to verify the ownership of a card. And that's the problem. A user who charges back money saying it wasn't him does not fly with gold, because the vendor can show that the package was sent to that person and only that person could receive the package with his ID+card, thus proving that person did buy the gold and that it's not some thief who stole his card and bought the gold with his money. But with bitcoin that proof isn't as easy to do thus most companies haven't risked trying it, but Circle has for example.\n\nAnd lastly, cards are expensive. Vendors pay about 1-3% for a payment. That's okay when you heat up and sell a $2 frozen pizza for $10 and pay the card company 30c. But when you sell X amount of value (e.g. $1k of gold or $1k of bitcoin), the user expects to pay that much. But if the user buys $1k of bitcoin and it costs you $30 to process that debit transaction, you'll charge at least $1030, and that isn't popular with consumers, which is why most usage ends up around exchanges that you send cheap ACH transactions to (that usually just cost a flat 25c). This is why this debit card stuff isn't something that many companies try, as it's expensive and therefore the demand is always going to be somewhat limited. Gold I guess can get away with fronting this fee because the number of people who sell their gold for shitty low prices and buy gold for ridiculously high prices is really really bad. It's the reason every city has a ton of 'WE BUY GOLD' stores. I don't mind fronting 3% when I buy n sell gold with a 15% spread. Considering bitcoin is so fungible (no different karats and stuff) and prices are transparent online, you can't get away with selling overpriced coins, so business naturally flows to cheap payment systems like cheap ACH-funded exchange accounts, rather than expensive card-based trades.\n\n": 2, 'Thanks so much bud! :) Really appreciate it.': 1, ">  If you're in an oppressive country then yes absolutely helping the citizens there\n\nOk, I'm in the U.S., so I guess I better start running the full client.": 1, 'It would cost more in fees, and if all transactions were broadcasts at the same time, there might be a chance of linkage.\n\nThis is an area that needs more work for sure.': 1, 'Thanks for the really comprehensive reply.

And you could wrap it as an app and put it in the appstore, too, that's not an issue.\n\nThe reason I said no, too, is because it wouldn't be truly cold storage (which is the point when generating a wallet offline), because the device has been connected to the internet at some point, and will be at some point, again. Either of those two is an issue, and prevents it from being a truly cold storage key.\n\nThe reason for this is that if a device was ever connected, it could be infected by malware, that for example instead of generating a random key, would generate a pre-set key the hacker chose, meaning if you put any bitcoin on that key, the hacker sees it and takes it out.\n\nAnd if the device never was connected to the internet, but will be, then you have the problem of a hacker potentially finding logs, backups, inspect the memory etc, and find the key, and then send it back to the hacker over the internet.\n\nNone of this is very likely or very common by the way, it'd be pretty safe regardless, but it doesn't take away the fact that this wouldn't be true cold storage, which is an important detail if you're looking to maximize security.": 1, 'I should know by now to look at the source code first :) Thanks for the tips, they definitively answer the question.': 2, "PayPal isn't accepting Bitcoin much rather BrainTree a company owned by PayPal accepts Bitcoin.

While controversial, they are providing a "necessary" and arguably essential service by proving liquidity to the market. If they did not, given the volume and transaction size they either process or require to conduct business for clients/customers then bitcoin\'s volatility would even be more out of sync and result in prolonged transaction times. Coinsafe has developed a possible solution though but it might be more applicable for micro payments (a tip, buying bread, etc.) \n\nMy short take is that off block transactions are going to be part of bitcoin\'s set up for the foreseeable future whether one agrees or disagrees with it. I\'m not endorsing or defending it, just trying to describe it from a macro perspective. It maintains market flow. There is also an economy of scale to be considered that is being developed around bitcoin and it\'s introducing a wide variety of financial tools to traders including derivatives to hedge risk and more recently currency swaps to protect counterparty risk. I would assume that off block transactions belong in this category.\n\nAs much as everyone would love to see bitcoin multiply 10x tomorrow, big market players are proactively seeking ways to avoid causing violent volatility swings. Even with the volatility, experienced traders are still able to profit using margin to short or go long. Bitcoin is growing up and becoming more sophisticated.

It's worth it to get the Brand Name version because you feel comfortable with the Name Brand, it's been around for a while, they take care of their customers, and release new versions periodically. Two examples could be Microsoft and QuickBooks. When you start a business you need a reliable platform to secure and access your basic data. Then you need reliable Point Of Sale software. You can't take chances if they did taxes right or wrong, and just switch to a competitor's POS software if you find a flaw in QuickBooks. You need something concrete from day 1, and paying for a reliable name is sometimes worth it. IMHO Steam is worth it, more so then Microsoft, and equally as much as a POS (like Quicken).": 1, 'Those of us that bought it got a special hat!': 4, "NO!

They could then make their own rules, like required tax on every single transaction, just like mining fees just bigger.

": -7, "I understand that buying software is like buying a license. There are a lot of analogies that one can make about cars and software, but a big problem with that is the fact that software isn't a tangible object.\n\nThe fact is, software is a completely different animal. You can't copy a car with the push of a button. You can't modify a car without spending any physical resources. But you can with software.\n\nMy point about software freedom is that a free software license IS like owning it yourself, which is how all the programs present themselves anyway. If I go to the store and buy a Windows disc, it appears like I am buying the software as a product. Now, as an educated person, I know that the only physical thing I'm buying is the disc, and the software is just licensed. Most people do not know this, and unless they read the EULA, they don't find out. It's not obvious like leasing a car.\n\nYet, at the same time, if I lease a car, I would hesitate to agree to terms that restrict me from going where I want to. If I pay the dues, I should be able to use the car for whatever purposes I want, and it's my responsibility if something happens. Of course here we encounter the problem that the dealer wouldn't want you to damage the car because they need it back eventually, and that doesn't line up with the way software works.\n\nSince software isn't a tangible object that you take temporary control over with intent to later return it, I believe it should be thought of like buying an item for yourself, and free software makes that possible. When I download the latest LibreOffice, that copy is mine. I can copy it. I can change it. I can sell it. This is all just like had it been a copy and not a license to use a copy. However, when I get MS Office, I am restricted. I have the ability to copy it, but MS says I'm not allowed to. It's unjust restriction to me, and I really pity those who still take part in it when they don't have to. I pity the ones who do NOT have a choice even more than the aforementioned, since they couldn't be free if they wanted to unless they have the money to fund a replacement.": 1, 'And if your not. steamloader.com is international i believe': 3, "It's likely due to regional pricing.

Apparently they (a consortium of large brand name franchises including CVS, 7-11, Dunkin Donut) didn't want to be controlled and held hostage by ApplePay's self enclosed ecosystem. Just look at the price the banks are paying who are virtually subsiding the system's fees.\n\nThese franchises have set up a consortium called Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX) and will be working with a cloud based provider called Paydiant to store customer financial information. To secure the data transaction, they'll use these Currentc tokens between the Pos to the cloud. To incentivize customers, these stores will offer discounts and rewards for using the system which would also eliminate the credit card fees.\n\nSome wild guess takeaways: 1. Our economy as we know it is entering a full digital age and all the heavy weights are on the playing field and quickly taking sides for our money. 2.

Equally I\'m more likely to make payments in the same country. So lets say you have a blockchain per city, suddenly your scaling challenges are simpler.\n\nHowever, having chains conflict with each other for hashrate is really unhealthy, so you want either sidechains or AuxPoW. Haven\'t thought much about which is better. Point is, you have a "master" chain that\'s actually mined, and a lot of other chains which borrow work from it.\n\nNext problem, I visit another city, or buy something online, and out of scope of this chain. So you need some way of moving funds up to the master chain, and across to the new localised chain. Proof of burn might work, but still working on theories for that. Knowing about the right chain to go to is also an issue.\n\nLastly, the "nearby" question; I\'m envisioning using network locality modelled by latency between nodes to determine how close a node is, for this purpose.

There are three main reasons that something like PayPal would not work properly for this system of donations and tips:\nMicrotransactions - The base fee on a traditional payment system is usually around $0.30. The 3% discount rate is then charged on top of that flat amount. This means PayPal and debit cards are impractical for donations, tips, and votes under $1.\nChargebacks - Chargebacks would also be a huge issue in this system. We cannot have people reversing payments after they\xe2\x80\x99ve made a donation. Posting original content is basically an irreversible transaction because it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to get something removed from the Internet after it is already out there. Since the content creator is posting a piece of work that cannot be taken back later, the same concept needs to be applied to the donations and tips. Otherwise, there could be a situation where donors/tippers/voters take back their money after the content has been posted. The content creator would be left with no payment for their work. This is especially troublesome in the Bitcoin vote monetization model because the voters who are able to make chargebacks could impact the results of the poll without having any intention of making a donation.\nCensorship - Bitcoin is censorship-resistant money. There would undoubtedly be unpopular content posted on BitMedia. People still need to be able to make their donations when this problem occurs. PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, and other payment companies cannot be trusted to always be fair when it comes to who can receive donations.

': 4, '...so I have a somewhat different/heretical conception of the term Bitcoin which i will explain here:\n\n\nI contend that what we are all thinking about when we say the word "Bitcoin" is actually, "the highest utility system for performing secure, trustless digital accounting." Since the Satoshi blockchain is really the only dominant system most people who think about these sorts of things have seen, there is a bit of confusion of terminology- I claim. People are saying Bitcoin for "high utility trustless digital means of accounting" the same way they say "Kleenex" when they mean tissue.\n\n\nThe trick becomes understanding this utility, and there are a number of reasons Bitcoin as we know it has the highest utility today: In my opinion, the most important one is this: Bitcoin has less baggage blurring its ability to be used as a mathematically-sound unit of account (primarily related to its resistance to state/ outside interference). It might make more or less sense for states to use bitcoin as a currency, but as a mathematically-sound accounting system, it is quite well-defined. If a system ever improves on this ability, then IT SHOULD become the "true Bitcoin".\n\nIn my opinion, the other primary feature of the Satoshi Blockchain-based crypto is its network effect, which plays directly to its security, which is critical for utility. We all are familiar with how the combined power of miners secures the network, so I dont think I should have to expand much here-- but if another system comes along with better security, this would improve utility, and if that utility is higher than Bitcoin, then that system Should become the true "Bitcoin" (again, I realize I am ignoring the fact that the term Bitcoin literally refers to the Satoshi blockchain-- I am using the term like most people use it, like "Kleenex")\n\nIf a bank manages to produce a crypto with higher utility, it should become dominant. If it has icky bank crap built into it, it can only have less utility as a simple, secure accounting database, and can\'t overthrow Bitcoin. If it has _some_ utility, perhaps to a different goal, then maybe they can coexist. If they have the same function, the one with greater utility will always win.\n\nSo can a bank fork Bitcoin just to spite the existing economy? I don\'t think so-- not without presenting a system with a technical advantage. If they attempt to really screw over the existing cryptosphere by creating a closed-market (cant buy it with bitcoins) coin with technical advantages over bitcoin, they have failed to create a universal means of value-accounting by artificially imposing barriers on the flow of value in their system-- a value-accounting system without such barriers would seem to have higher utility, so the banks would have just created yet another shitty alt.': 1, 'You\'re right, technically he should have said "*potentially* the best," though I think that shade of meaning is understood by most bitcoiners (most are very cognizant of the fact that Bitcoin could fail).': 1, "No. No. NO.

This is true, and in order to bootstrap B\'s value, pretty useful-- but I feel the most important thing we are doing by using b in everyday "consumer" transactions is vetting the technological features and security of the system. Crash test dummies, as it were, for this radical system-- we are literally beta-testers, Bitcoin is pre-1.0 currently.\n\nIn the long run, if the technology, security and meta-economics of mining all hold up to the best attempts to be broken by us-- the test dummies, then I contend that _consumer adoption is completely irrelevant_. \n\nIf all of the underlying assumptions of Bitcoin are true-- there is literally no force that can hold it back-- if the assumptions are correct, it is in some sense, "better gold"-- and eventually, we may find that the only agents that possess it in any meaningful quantity will be state actors and large financial interests. Sort of like gold today. \n\nWhile bitcoin _does_ work great as a consumer token (I love making bitcoin transactions to buy crap because I don\'t need to give all my personal data to a third party just to get stolen because they cut corners on hiring netsec staff #target #HomeDepot)-- governments might not be so happy to let their people hold this substance and undermine their internal incumbent currency-dynamics. Some states have already tried to make it far more difficult for individuals to hoard gold... and I think this is a clear behavioral precedent regarding what to expect from these organizations in the future. (I\'d rather not get into the deeper philosophy of whether this is right or wrong-- lets just assume that the historical pattern which has been in place since... about... the dawn of time? holds true: States control the economic realities of their citizens.)\n\nWhat, then, does bitcoin have to offer for state actors and huge financial interests that gold doesn\'t already provide? I offer that simply the existence of things like m of n security, relative ease of secure storage compared to a pile of gold, inability to pull a Nixon w.r.t to their debts to other states, some types of monetary scripting, etc offer significant value above what  "old gold" offers.
