': 2, "Hi Vitalik.\n\nGreat content.\n\nCoinSpark (http://coinspark.org/), just released, solves the SPV problem by having each issuer take responsibility for providing an asset tracking server that responds to queries from wallets regarding the balance of the asset in each transaction output. We provide an open source server any issuer can run, or they can use our ones for free which track all assets, or they can use both in a redundant way, and they can change their minds any time. Since the holder is already placing legal/financial trust in the issuer, I don't see it as a stretch for them also to place some technical trust in the issuer as well.\n\nAs for the problem of a centralized exchange sucking money out of the system, I agree. CoinSpark will have a federated model where wallets can connect to multiple exchanges simultaneously, creating competition between exchanges that will drive spreads downward. The wallet will autonomously disconnect from exchanges that repeatedly make offers they can't fulfil, so this solves the trust problem. This same model can also be used to connect directly to issuers for purchase and/or redemption.\n\nIn my view the trouble with all the protocols in the MasterCoin/Counterparty/Ethereum category is that they scale terribly, once we have millions of assets and millions of transactions per asset. You can't track one asset independently of the others and the *network* has to know the full set of balances for every single asset. In CoinSpark the network ignores all assets (since it's built on bitcoin) and we apply the principle of asset independence so that the tracking server for each asset can ignore all the others. The mathematical model is unlimited different asset types per transaction output, so that one UTXO from the network's perspective can contain any number of different assets. Again, extremely efficient from the network's perspective.\n\nThink about the web. It's a federated model, and each content provider pays almost all of the cost associated with providing their content. We've built out the same model for colored coins, and ultimately I think it will be much cheaper on a per-transaction basis, since the network needs to remember much less.\n\nAnyway, maybe we'll get a chance to chat about this in Tel Aviv.\n\nGideon": 0, "The only reason any of us are nerding it out on Reddit, is because we are financially incentivized to make these arguments.\n\nThe bottom line is if you had to pay Satoshi $1 per BTC transaction, Bitcoin never would be where it is today.

Is your argument that Satoshi shouldn't have done what he did?": 5, ">I don't like the idea that people have to maintain servers\n\nI accept it's not ideal. But people don't have to maintain servers themselves. They can rent them as an external service, and change providers at any time by modifying a field on the asset web page. You could make the same criticism of the web - that people have to maintain their own servers. But in practice it's not a barrier because a whole industry sprung up to provide this service for them, cheaply and easily.\n\n> Problem: they're all built on Bitcoin, and so all Bitcoin full nodes have to be aware of the UTXOs for every single color ever alongside the uncolored ones. So it doesn't scale.\n\nThe scalability problem comes when you need one UTXO per holder per color, which uniquely is not the case in CoinSpark.\n\nI don't think having one UTXO per color issued will be such a problem, because there won't be *that* many colors ever issued, perhaps 1 billion in the imaginable future. Again, think about how many websites or domain names there are in the world.\n\nAnd I don't think having one (or 2/3) UTXOs per person/entity will be such a problem, because there are a limited number of entities in the world, say 10 billion. CoinSpark is designed so that each person/entity can have one UTXO containing all of their colors.\n\nThe real problem comes when every node in the network has to maintain the full state of holder-balances for every single color.

': 1, "> I would be interested in understanding why you think this.\n\nBasically, I think that most currencies which simultaneously have (1) proof of work and (2) a finite capped supply are living on borrowed time. They have advertised themselves as being simultaneously good stores of value due to never expanding past a certain point and being secure transfer media, but the problem is that the security as a transfer medium depends on the supply expansion. For now, it appears that things are high because the subsidies are all basically in full gear. However, over the next two decades the subsidies are going to taper off drastically - by 2032, Bitcoin's PoW reward is going to be ~0.78 BTC per block, 32x less than it is now, and fees have so far been consistently at ~0.1-0.5 BTC per block over bitcoin's history so we can assume they'll stay there for a total mining reward of ~1 BTC per block. It has been estimated that currently Bitcoin costs $70 million of hardware to 51% attack; under 2032 conditions it would only cost $2 million. If BTC goes up another 1000x (ie. $5 trillion market cap, roughly same as gold), that becomes $2 billion. At that point, we have a global systemically important financial instrument which costs an amount to attack which is well within North Korea's military budget - and given North Korea's existing willingness to counterfeit US dollars we can guess exactly what they're going to do.\n\nMy view on Bitcoin is that I see it as a good replacement for gold, but not much more - for transactional use continually better and better protocols will keep replacing it.

Counterparty, on the other hand, removes the need for such services in most cases (the only remaining use case is basically HFT) because there\'s a zero-fee (except bitcoin fees) decentralized exchange already baked right into the protocol.\n\nNow to answer some concerns:\n\n> Why should I even have to pay $1 to create an asset? \n\nSame reason you pay $8.95 to buy a domain name; it\'s not an evil conspiracy, it\'s spam protection. If the price was $0.000895, squatters would have bought up all the domains and sold them back to you for the market price, which we might assume is something close to $8.95, except the difference would be pocketed by the squatters instead of a relatively decent public-goods-providing institution such as ICANN.\n\n> Why should I be exposed to the distraction of yet one more ticker price to do something as mundane as create an asset? Other protocols don\xe2\x80\x99t require it. It is a barrier to entry that was never needed. It is an obstacle, an eyesore on the protocol, a bad idea from the beginning.\n\nEventually, wallets will abstract away all of the different platform tokens, and will give you the ability to save in whatever you think is the best investment (eg. some BTC, some kind of weird [SchellingUSD](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed/), Overstock shares), and buy platform tokens as needed in real time. You\'ll just see "cost of registering an asset: $3.68. Accept / Reject?" and the wallet will do the conversions for you Ripple-style.\n\n> If it had wanted to preserve the baked-in complexity, refusing to modularize, they could have built sophisticated two-way sidechains with all the desired features therein.\n\nYay! Let\'s require innovators wanting to build a basic stock exchange to come up with a fundamentally new two-way cross-chain two-way-pegging protocol, _and_ walk around asking permission from all major mining pools to adopt it!\n\n> Another approach, the one I prefer, would be to build features in discrete, minimalistic steps. \n\nProblem: for a decentralized exchange to work, orders must be enforceable, which means that _the protocol_ needs to have the ability to move currency units around without users\' permission. This is basically the reason why Ethereum can\'t work off of Bitcoin (at least directly; one can do certain things with the aforementioned one-way cross-chain SPV proofs), and applies equally well to Counterparty.\n\n> XCP introduces a moral hazard. XCP holders are incentivized to propagate the Counterparty protocol to enhance the value of their holdings. \n\nUmm, you do realize that\'s a primary reason why BTC has gotten anywhere at all and why people like Roger Ver have spent timeless months evangelizing for Bitcoin and getting merchants to be the first guinea pigs to accept it far before its time? If Bitcoin did not have the incentivization aspect baked in, it may well have met the same fate as Diaspora.\n\nIn fact, I would argue that everyone saying "Bitcoin for everything is the way to go!" is suffering from the exact same "moral hazard" in the opposite direction.\n\n> XCP, besides being poor design, was probably born as a vehicle to monetize Bitcoin 2.0.\n\nMaybe. If so, I have no problem with it. People need money. Question is, is the approach that you are using to get money one that imposes otherwise unnecessary costs on the network, or not? I would argue that creating an asset is FAR less intrusive than charging monopolistic fees.\n\n> [Note: not from here] But colored coins supports SPV and XCP doesn\'t!\n\nAs politifact would say, Mostly False. Colored coins does work okay with SPV if you are dealing with a color which is relatively unused (eg. a few thousand transactions total since genesis), but for larger colors there is an exponential blowup problem where "proving" the color of each UTXO would require proving the color of its parents, then parents of all those parents, etc, all the way back to the genesis, at which point you\'ve ended up processing a substantial portion of all UTXO that were ever connected with your color. So, SPV support works in some cases, but not nearly close enough to 100% of them for people to be able to rely on it. So in practice I would consider XCP and CC roughly equivalent in this regard.\n\nColored coins was an awesome idea, and I applaud everyone who worked on it from 2010-2013, but my personal opinion is that XCP-style meta-consensus systems are the next generation from here, at least as far as Bitcoin-based protocols are concerned.': 47, "Open Assets allows for trustless exchange of assets and/or BTC.

": 3, 'So, open source\'s victory is actually a much more mixed bag than people realize. Two points on that:\n\n1. The big change that started to happen around 2000 is that software started moving to the web, and software started to become collaborative - meaning that it wasn\'t just a private app that you download to your computer, it\'s something that you do with other people. This means that software developers now have a new weapon - network effects. Facebook\'s software is not particularly impressive; people come and stay for the network. That was what made open source practical - the code is a peripheral, it\'s the community that matters.\n\n2. Most software today is still closed-source - in fact, it\'s even more closed source than it was in the 1980s. The "software" is just in the form of web applications, where half the app is on a server. At least if you have a copy of MS Windows, you can reverse engineer it, run it inside a VM, wireshark it to see if it\'s sending out any data, etc. You also know that your data is still private, and you can access it. With modern web apps, it\'s all on Facebook\'s servers, and you have no way to know what they\'re doing to your data.\n\nThere was no great moral victory in society, incentives just changed somewhat (I can go into more detail if you wish but I have a dark hunch that many so-called "moral victories" in society are really a result of economic parameters changing to make the world more incentive-compatible making certain classes of "moral" behavior more "affordable" from a private-incentive standpoint).

I don't like the idea that people have to maintain servers; I see a primary benefit of decentralization being that people can be lazy and don't have to worry about maintennance one the initialization step is done.\n\n> In my view the trouble with all the protocols in the MasterCoin/Counterparty/Ethereum category is that they scale terribly, once we have millions of assets and millions of transactions per asset. You can't track one asset independently of the others and the network has to know the full set of balances for every single asset. In CoinSpark the network ignores all assets (since it's built on bitcoin) and we apply the principle of asset independence so that the tracking server for each asset can ignore all the others. The mathematical model is unlimited different asset types per transaction output, so that one UTXO from the network's perspective can contain any number of different assets. Again, extremely efficient from the network's perspective.\n\nProblem: they're all built on Bitcoin, and so all _Bitcoin_ full nodes have to be aware of the UTXOs for every single color ever alongside the uncolored ones.

As mentioned above, I think that charging monopolistic fees is more harmful to users than the floating token approach.\n\nTo some it all up, I think the primary question we should be trying to answer is, how do we bring the ugliness / monetization ratio as low as possible? My belief as a pragmatist who cares about users and understands the realities of development is that making new tokens is the least-bad approach for many applications.\n\n> In my opinion, network effects on Bitcoin must dominate. There is one universal consensus ledger. All the others will fall away to obsolescence over time\n\nOkay. If the SHA256 ASIC oligopoly serves you well then I'll let it be. Just be sure to pay the carbon taxes to offset your effect on the environment.\n\n> But that might be a disaster for certain vested parties.\n\nFunnily enough, I get that exact same feeling every time (well ok most times, the ones who stick to the positive and not the normative claim can be reasonable) I talk to a Bitcoin dominance maximalist...": 3, "Vitalik, thanks for chiming in.  Let me address your points.\n\n- The fee to create an asset as spam protection.\n \nThere are ways to make assets independently trackable, so not every tracking server needs to follow every asset.  Paying a fee to be 'tracked' could be an off-chain arrangement, whereby you pay for your color to be tracked by a third party.  So a fee-as-spam-protection is not necessary to economize on monitoring costs.\n\nAlso squatters are not a problem with Colored Coins since an almost infinite space of Color Addresses exist.\n\n- XCP as 'abstracted away' and thus irrelevant.\n\nI'm sure it could be abstracted away.  But my point still stands that functionality must be unlocked with an asset with a floating price.  That's really annoying and inelegant no matter how buried it is for the user.\n\n- Side chains as too-high a technical burden for innovators\n\nLook, we want to do things the right way.  If we're inscribing equity in the Blockchain, maybe it's worth taking the extra effort to do it right, instead of quickly.  Sidechains obviate the problem of floating XCP.  Just because it's hard, doesn't mean its wrong.  Unlike many other Bitcoin projects, equity representation needs to be done right from the start.\n\n- Decentralized Exchange is possible with Colored Coins.  \n\n(I'm pretty sure, someone correct me if this doesn't make sense)\nWrite a TX with colored inputs and BTC.  By playing with the order of the colored state of the outputs, you can exchange colors for BTC, or colors for colors, in such a way that multiple parties sign off on the TX inputs after that the outputs exchange assets correctly.\n\n- The one correct point you made was the one I did not argue in my post\n\nColored Coins don't have SPV.  That is true as far as I can tell.  A side chain implementation could have that, in addition to avoiding the hassle of converting to an altcoin with a floating price.  \n\nVitalik, I have the highest respect for what you have accomplished technically.  But I'm not sure you are allowing for the possibilities implicit in Colored Coins and side chains because you are personally wedded to Ethereum, which has taken a dramatically different strategy (i.e. another floating altcoin).": 7, "The 0.5 XCP issuance anti-spam fee is entirely temporary. Moreover, in the near-term, we'll be switching the fee to be proportional to the total money supply (`xcp_fee = 0.5 * (money_supply/2.6*10**7`)), so that it'll be impossble for the XCP ever to 'run out'.": 8, "> You could make the same criticism of the web - that people have to maintain their own servers. But in practice it's not a barrier because a whole industry sprung up to provide this service for them, cheaply and easily.\n\nHeh. It's actually still a pretty major barrier in practice. I helped run the Bitcoin Magazine website for 2 years, and we quite frequently had outages that we needed to have some techie attend to. In the case of Ethereum, making sure our ether sale website was DDoS proof took thousands of dollars and months. Decentralization would probably have substantially mitigated both of those problems.\n\n> Yes, this may well be a great solution, I agree. For example http://factom.org/ (not our project)\n\nHmm, I'm starting to see a common trend here. The primary argument that they raise for basing things on Bitcoin is to leverage its security. If Bitcoin proponents are correct in their estimation of the security of proof of work in the long term, then I can see this argument being correct. My view, on the other hand, is that (1) Bitcoin is running on borrowed time and PoW is going to get rather flimsy come 2032 or so, and (2) proof of stake provides better security against outsiders and lower fears and politics on the inside (eg. no GHash; in fact, I have a conjecture that our latest version of [Slasher Ghost](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/10/03/slasher-ghost-developments-proof-stake/) encourages people to put their stake into decentralized stakepools if at all possible, as the objective is to minimize risk of a takeover attack, so it actually incentivizes the market to produce more decentralization over time).

Its in a stakeholders best interest (in terms of return on investment) to do both of those.  \n\n\nSame with tragedy of the commons - a more common argument in academia than real world.

Companies do not abuse their monopoly (Microsoft and IE).\n2. Companies do not form regulations that block out competitors (Comcast).\n\nMonopolies are what most companies want as it is how they maximize profit, it's just how the capitalist system works.\n\n": 1, "Every company in every sector wants to become a monopoly.

Companies want to build barriers to entry to keep out competition. Many do this through regulation, as its much easier to use the hammer of the law rather than innovate to effectively block competitors or upstarts.\n\n\nThis is why it is so important for bitcoin to have as little regulation as possible, preferably none.
