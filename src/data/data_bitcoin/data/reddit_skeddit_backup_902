The point is that this would require to do any bitcoin-related stuff in Linux (the host system) and any execution of unsafe programs in the guest system. The disadvantage is that you are still running some software of a lower security level. The plus is that you can use Windows stuff you can\'t easily get rid of without problems.\n\nHere are a few pointers which discuss that kind of setup:\n\nhttp://www.landzdown.com/anti-spyware-software/how-safe-is-linux-running-in-virtual-machine-under-windows-7/?PHPSESSID=14c6f9c053511c3e7569854806903220\n\nhttp://www.linuxjournal.com/content/using-windows-xp-virtualbox-linux\n\nhttp://ask-leo.com/does_running_windows_in_a_virtual_machine_protect_me_from_viruses.html\n\n\n> Also, to be honest, I am somewhat lazy and not sure how much work it would be and whether VMs running on Linux would work sufficiently well for me.\n\nLearning to master Linux will cost time and patience, this is true. But I think that the effort to install Linux and do trivial things is often over-estimated, especially if you use a  distribution geared to beginners, like Ubuntu or Linux Mint. You can have it up and running within one hour, and you can try out via the live systems on USB sticks whether your hardware is well enough supported. \n\nWhat would make the switch easier for you is if you already use either a web mailer for email, or a cross-platform program like Thunderbird.\n\nThere exist even a big plus for installing Windows in VMs: When using a VM, you usually do not have any driver problems because the "virtual" computer is one that is well supported by all guest systems.\n\nAlso, Linux has no problems with handling large directories and files which represent the VM system images.

The only difference is that they have the financial backing and legal counsel from those who specialize in these things.\n\n\nMost of what the pros do is technically "legal" so there\'s nothing to prosecute.  And when it\'s not 100% legal, they know how to structure their arrangements to fall within certain grey areas of the law, making a successful prosecution of their practices, a legal nightmare.\n\n\nInstead of facing any of these fundamental issues, or having the balls to investigate real cases, the prosecutors, as typical, go for the low hanging fruit.  Regardless of the fact that what Shrem did, is for all practical purposes, harmless.': 14, '>They had no choice. When federal agents were investigating silk road they discovered Shrem was helping launder money. They can\'t just ignore crimes that are taking place right in front of them.

However, the law affords them considerable latitude in how they do that\xe2\x80\x94and for good reason.\n\n\nThe best exercise of justice lies in the ability to weigh the many factors involved, and effect a reasonable degree of pressure and/or punishment.  What I see here, is ***not*** that.  I see the typical "throw the book" at him, hope the charges stick, resulting in an easy plea deal\xe2\x80\x94which they got.\n\n\nI\'ve never known a prosecutor to give a second thought as to whether (and to what extent) they should have charged.  Nor whether they just ruined someone\'s life in the process.\n\n\nFor crying out loud, we have grandmas in federal penitentiary for growing and consuming cannabis for their arthritis.  In one case I was reading about, an elderly lady invited an officer in her home for tea, only to be imprisoned, when he saw her plants in her kitchen.\n\n\nShrem\'s *amateur-ness*, clearly evident, is more of a sign of his lack of criminal intention.  Most pros in this business, who know very well what they\'re doing from the start, take the necessary steps from square-one to maintain security and plausible deniability.\n\n\nLastly, money-laundering is fundamentally a questionable "crime" to begin with.  If I think of routing certain funds in a certain way with a certain intention:  it\'s legal.  But if I think about it in a different way, even if I\'m essentially doing the same thing, and am willing to disclose my thought process and paper trail, then it can be illegal.  This is one of the reasons banks place a premium on confidentially of their internal records.  No matter what their intentions, if records are made public, they may be used to construct a case against them, regardless of their intent.\n\n\nThis is also a reason that some folks (perhaps more on the extreme side) call money-laundering a "thought-crime."  It\'s already illegal to do whatever the action was, that the "laundering" is suspected of aiding.  Why not simply prosecute *that* original action?  And if the core action wasn\'t illegal, is it even laundering then?\n\n\nIn the case of Shrem, so what if he sold bitcoin to someone\xe2\x80\x94even if they told him they were going to spend it at the Silk Road?  Several items for sale at the Silk Road are perfectly legal.  Furthermore, even if someone told Shrem they wanted bitcoin for the explicit reason of purchasing drugs, who\'s to say those drugs aren\'t legal in that person\'s jurisdiction?  The Silk Road sells internationally.': 7, "That's some bullshit, he didn't do anything wrong.": 0, '> ;\n\nFTFY': 3, 'This is justice according to the book, but it is not an equitable outcome.

Most of us would think no.  But when it's a Shaw-256 key does that make it money?  If so, all the government need do, is inform people that they consider it to be money now, and that applicable money-transmitter laws regarding it, will now be in effect.\n\n\nTo retroactively charge someone for a crime when the state of what bitcoin is, remains undefined, doesn't even leave the good actors the chance to exit the market, or consult with attorneys to get up to speed, so that they may implement the rules correctly.\n\n\nIt's a severely harsh punishment, and suggests a level of prosecutorial zeal that isn't warranted in this case.\n\n\nIn regard to money-laundering, I suspect that charge is more of a subset of violating the money-transmitter laws, particularly their AML, KYC, SAR, BSA regulations.

And I certainly was not confusing GM with monoculture. Perhaps I should not have said that GMO crops usually *require* pesticides, but that GMO crops are usually used in conjunction with pesticides. Yes, there are GMO crops with "built in" pest resistance in their GMO genome, but the majority of conventionally farmed crops are using pesticides. I live in the rural Midwest, I see the farmers spraying all the time.\n\nOrganic farming practices sometimes implement natural pesticides like neem oil, but we (I help out on an organic farm) never use chemical pesticides and that is the point I was trying to make. Organic practices are always better for the environment.\n\nWhat I had meant to point out regarding GMO genes threatening our food supply is that Monsanto\'s GMO corn\'s patented gene ends up in its pollen which makes its way to organic corn crops, resulting in organic corn crops containing this GMO gene. This makes it difficult to grow purely organic corn and even more difficult to save organic seed when everyone else is growing Monsanto\'s corn. If we reach a point where it\'s impossible to save organic corn seed because every organic crop has been polluted with Monsanto\'s gene, then what? Then you have a situation like what I was talking about where the heirloom varieties are gone and all we have is Monsanto corn.\n\nHumans having engineered plants and animals over centuries is far different than taking genes from one organism and splicing them into another organism. This is opening up a can of worms about which we know very, very little. And it\'s entirely unnecessary. Organic farming and permaculture practices work with the planet\'s natural cycles and are more than powerful enough to produce enough food for everyone.': 0, "weren't you just the other day telling people not to buy gift cards on purse, because you claimed to have gotten a carded GC??? now you are here saying it's ok???": 1, 'Busted ;)': 1, 'How do you get this 3% discount?

It\'s only true in the via of currency as having to be a commodity. Bitcoin instead can be viewed as the first digital commodity. It may not have physical commodity status, but it may have digital commodity status--because it transmits its value with it, it does not refer to an outside value like digital transactions involving fiat do.\n\nRemember that fiat came about first as scrip for a commodity good. Bitcoin has not gotten started this way, instead deriving its value from being the lowest transaction-cost currency, meaning its commodity value is tied to its exchange value.\n\nIt is the first of its kind, a money that relies on its exchange value as its first value, rather than fiat and physical moneys that relied on their commodity value as their first value.\n\nCommodity money and indeed fiat itself also came to rely on their exchange value. Prior to bitcoin we had examples of a money that didn\'t go the commodity route. Now we do.\n\nThis doesn\'t make it "like fiat", since the way fiat got established was by piggybacking off the credibility of scrip for commodities, whereas bitcoin got started by its promise as a superior form of exchange value--it\'s lower transaction cost status.\n\nAnd that\'s still its killer business case to this day. Lot\'s of people don\'t understand that.\n\n> Like paper money, there is absolute no reason why a bitcoin should have value\n\nThere is, actually--the fact of bitcoin being the lowest transaction-cost currency for online and distanced transactions. It\'s cheaper than every form of money for those kinds of transaction. This is a killer feature and very desirable. \n\n> except that someone declares that it has value.\n\nSee above for its killer application. If it had no business case, as you assume, it wouldn\'t likely have any value still to this day.\n\n> In the case of crypto, it has value only because people are willing to throw money at it and others are willing to buy it.\n\nThe network effect can\'t jumpstart a currency, it can only come after the fact.

Coincidentally, I make them :)\n\nBasically, the receiver has to generate a key part (KP1) and send it to you in the form of a hash. You then use the [Vanitygen software](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=25804.0) to generate a custom, or simply random, Bitcoin address that has another key part (KP2), that is generated based off of the hash derived from KP1. When you send the Bitcoin address and KP2 to the receiver, they enter KP1 and KP2 into a web tool ([main page](http://gobittest.appspot.com/), [Vanity address key part sum test](http://gobittest.appspot.com/VanitySum)) and it will give them the private key for the corresponding Bitcoin address. \n\nTL;DR:\nThe receiver is the only person who has seen KP1, and when you use software to give them KP2, they can generate the private key for their new Bitcoin address.': 4, 'Look into bip38': 2, 'Stealth addresses can be used off block chain via the payment protocol.
