Your just focusing on the number of kids that can carry boxes, this is an oversimplification of the issue, what about all these other issues:\n\n * Do you realize if you increase the width of the box by n times, you could increase its mass by n^3 ?  This is a non linear problem, therefore we need to be very cautious with increases.  I know many people say this is not true and just because we increase the size of the box they may not be full and therefore the mass may not change as much.  This is not the correct philosophy, we need to assume the worst case attack scenarios of full boxes.\n\n * Currently these boxes are on sale at some small Mom-and-pop stores across the globe.  I admit there are not enough stores and this needs to increase.  If we increase the box size the boxes will no longer fit in the smaller stores and may not be available on display.  The boxes may only fit in large out of town stores like Walmart or be available online from Amazon, where your order can be tracked by the NSA.  Is that the future we want?  I thought this project was about helping the little guy and not large greedy corporations or the government.\n\n * What about the factories which make the boxes?  Why should they make boxes that are so big that they are not full.  I have a vision for the future where most boxes are full.  We should not increase the box size too much right now, to allow the possibility of full boxes one day.\n\n * Maybe kids could carry boxes which are a bit larger, but what about the box producers?  There are already only a few factories globally that can make the boxes,  but if the boxes are larger then an even smaller number of factories will be able to make boxes.  We need to ensure there are many potential box producers.\n\n * Why are we making the boxes 8,000x bigger by 2035?  How do you know what kids will be able to carry then?  What kind of business ever makes such detailed plans that far into the future?  Lets double the sizes of boxes now and worry about 2035 some other time.  Please stop advocating such an excessive increase in the box size.\n\n * There is too much focus on simple things such as what today's kid can carry.  We also need to consider how fast they can carry the boxes around.  How are the children going to have fun if they spend all their time carrying boxes and do not have enough time to actually use and enjoy them?\n\n * Also what about increasing the risk of dropping the box.  If the box becomes too large, fine the kids can probably carry it most of the time, but there is a larger risk that it is dropped and then damaged.  This is bad and the risk of dropping the box should be minimized.

Would the truck buyer really have sued the bitcoin seller in actual court across the country, found assets that you could go after, and recovered any money? Probably not. The only reason the bitcoin seller showed up was because he was paid to appear by the show and the show paid the damages.\n\nIn your case, you were the one who got screwed. Going to the police would do nothing, and the bank will stonewall you until you actually initiate legal action. \n\nMeanwhile, the scammers have $3,000 and they will just keep going and no one will make even the slightest effort to find them.

She places her BTC into an escrow service, somebody deposits the funds into her bank account, the trader confirms the deposit, and the funds are released from escrow. This is a really safe way to sell BTC.  \n\nHere is what the victim is doing: he sees a really good deal online and he's hooked in somehow. Once the victim is on the hook, he's given payment instructions to a bank account, which is not the scammer's bank account. But wait... **somebody else's bank account**? How does the scammer get the money then?  \n\nSimple: once the victim is ready to make a deposit, the scammer opens a trade with the trader. In some cases, they might open the trade with a good markup on the BTC, so they're sure they'll find a trader. When the trader gives them the deposit instructions, they simply forward the information to the victim. The victim deposits the funds into the trader's account, the trader gives the BTC to the scammer and the scammer disappears.  \n\nThe net result: the trader is holding stolen property, the victim has not received the product and the scammer has washed their stolen money.  \n\nIn this case, the plaintiff on Judge Judy is the victim and the defendant is the trader. Unfortunately, the trader didn't clearly explain the situation and it subsequently resulted in him looking like a fool. He's still in possession of stolen property, but he really had no way of knowing that. Of course, if he knew about it, then he might be criminally liable.": 2, "IMO it's a mistake to fixate oneself on these details.\n\nThe thing is MITM attacks are trivial and there are people out there already with a certain infrastructure to pull them off so BTC<->bank transfer without reputation is a minefield. \n\nAlso the judge absolutely fucked up this one, partly because the guy looks stoned and didn't even bother bringing evidence to the court.

Sure we\'ll know how Lightning Network works, but there will be new developments in the interim, and we won\'t know how those will shape up in the years that follow. \n\nThere will be people who will say: "we need to wait a few years to see how the CoinTeleport Network works once it\'s deployed before we make many kind of long term commitment on the block size limit". And we will be equally in the dark about future broadband growth, so that facet of planning will be just as uncertain.\n\nAnd there are added risks. With 8 MB limit blocks, assuming the network will be four years more developed, and if blocks are full, 16 times more active than it is now, it will have a much larger community. A larger community might make it difficult to actually do another hard fork, meaning there will be a higher likelihood that we will be stuck at 2020 forever.\n\nOr if we do manage to get consensus for another hard fork in 2020, it might only be possible to get one for a tiny bump, e.g. to 10 MB, and then Bitcoin will form some kind of hard fork committee, that does a small bump every few years.\n\nThis centralized process is necessary because hard forks rely on a significant degree of social centralization so that the wide consensus needed is attained, and this need for social centralization will only grow as the community grows, and more segments of the community are disconnected from other segments of the community. In this environment, major figures will appear that act as de facto leaders. \n\nIf these major leaders are corrupted we\'ll be in trouble.\n\nWhat all of this leads to is that the Bitcoin protocol will be less predictable, reliably scalable, and more prone to centralization, the longer we wait to deal with the hard limit permanently.\n\n>The major issue people have with BIP 101 is not necessarily the jump to 8 MB, but moreso that it tries to estimate too far out (20 years), an issue because it\'s unrealistic or not a good idea to predict that far out when it comes to technology, especially bandwidth (Vitalik recently agreed with that; he said his approach is to try to find a way to have a dynamic cap based on economic info gleaned from the blockchain).\n\nTwo points:\n\nFirst, I agree that we can\'t predict the rate of broadband growth with any reliable precision. We could look at the doubling as not an attempt to track broadband growth, but rather a way to get to the maximum size (2 GB) at a predictable and somewhat moderate pace. 2 GB is MUCH MUCH bigger than 1 MB (2,000X bigger to be exact), yet not so far from 1 MB as to be totally unthinkable today. In fact, there are home internet connections that can handle that load today. \n\nGoogle Fibre can more than handle 2 GB of upload/download every 10 minutes, today, and I think it\'s a very safe assumption that the percentage of the population that has Google Fibre calibre connections in 20 years will be much larger than today, meaning that it\'s virtually guaranteed that 2 GB blocks in 2036 will not place the network in a situation where there only the negligible percentage of the population can run a full node from home.\n\nSecond, I agree that ideally the limit would be based on blockchain info. In fact I made a proposal along those lines. But these are very theoretical solutions, that might never pan out, or might take a long time. For Bitcoin to maximize its chances of global mass adoption now in the near future, it needs to resolve the hard limit issue that hangs over it and harms its institutional buy-in through the Fidelity Effect. \n\nKeep in mind, we could implement a long-term solution, and then do another hard fork if another, better solution presents itself. But at least having a long-term solution in place means that if another hard fork ends up becoming infeasible, we\'ll still be okayish, because the blockchain will eventually have a 2 GB limit that should satisfy a huge amount of long-term needs, and not pose any risk of stifling growth until long after mass-adoption has been achieved.\n\n': -1, "Why can't I argue otherwise with brandwidth prediction below 41%? I'm not predicting that Google Fibre calibre connections will grow at 41% per year in availability. Only that they will be much more widely deployed in 20 years than now. That can happen with sub-41% growth rates.\n\n>Bitcoin is inherently a settlement system so we should focus on deploying payment systems on top of it.\n\nThis is a statement of faith, that has come out of nowhere, and been adopted for no reason. Furthermore, there is no telling whether 2 GB blocks will meet all settlement needs. Settlement and payment are not even clearly defined concepts. They're more of a continuum, with large value transfers on one end, and loosely defined as settlement, and small value transactions on the other, and loosely defined as payment.": 1, "We should not be using guesswork at all. We don't know the limits of future bandwidth. The only responsible BIPs are ones that work with what we know to be true. If in the future we can handle blocks of X size, without risking considerable centralization, then we can discuss that blocksize.

We're either making a guess on what future broadband deployment will allow, or we're making a guess about the ability of a larger community to do a hard fork without introducing major centralizing social institutions that can get corrupted. \n\n**There is no zero-risk option.** As much people don't like uncertainty, they have to accept that any block size limit solution, including keeping the limit at 1 MB, contains uncertainty. People have zeroed in on risk to full node deployment and mining decentralization posed by large blocks, and totally ignored all of the other risks that are exacerbated by not doing a hard fork that allows Bitcoin to scale without further social intervention via hard forks. I'd argue that social intervention to change the protocol is dangerous, and the probability that there will be a need for future social intervention like this should be minimized to the extent possible.\n": 0, "Fully agreed except for the 8MB bit.

Attacking Bitcoin becomes much easier when you have a way bloat it, even if such an attack isn\'t realized until fees become the main source of income for miners.\n\nExpanding block size will lead to the need to adjust other parameters to mitigate the problems added. Over time, it will look more and more like how a central bank tweaks knobs to try and achieve "health". *OMG no one is paying fees? Well, let\'s force them! How much? How about we double it every 3 years? Fees are too high? OMG let\'s mitigate that with a parameter change.* Bleh.\n\nIn my eyes, this is all going down the wrong path, particularly when you consider that none of the popular proposals have a method for determining their chosen block size, nor do they propose dynamic block sizes, miners are still mining empty blocks, decentralization issues are being glossed over, node count is not incentivized, etc.\n\nI just don\'t see the need to tweak the blocksize until someone can come up with a proper method of identifying what network factors should instigate a size change, that those changes be dynamic, and that they not act as functionally infinite (block cap never able to be hit). \n\nHonestly, I\'m much more interested in concepts like node incentivization, decreased block time/size & unbundling of tx from blocks (smaller, faster blocks), checking and readjusting mining difficulty more dynamically/frequently, anonymization of tx/wallets, etc, etc. \n\nIt\'s insulting to us all that we accept block size increase as the "issue" of the day when the only people that openly want it are centralized powers (Bitpay, Coinbase, etc), a handful of egomaniacal devs, and the social media fans and sock puppets of the aforementioned. \n\nIt\'s made even more ridiculous when you consider that there are alternatives like sidechains & lightning network under development, and centralized layers that people like Coinbase could employ to relieve bottlenecks to their customers anyway (like how banks and credit card networks are experimenting with blockchains).\n\nThis of course leads me to believe the only logical reason such a change would be promoted so heavily is a malicious one, with the enemy either wanting the opportunity to exploit the hard fork in process, or to exploit the newly compromised network after the block size has increased.\n\n': 3, '> there no symptoms of a problem to fix\n\nSo the 1mb limit is the most productive and efficient? \n\nDid Satoshi hand it down from on high saying, "Thus doest Satoshi declare, the 1 megabyte block shall ever be instituted amongst the Network.

These developments are pushing more and more financial activity outside the traditional financial sector. The sharing economy is upending entire industries. Here, I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking about things like peer-to-peer home rental services such as VRBO and mediated services such as Uber.\n\n>These types of trends raise questions for the Bank. Consider a cashless society where everyone uses e-money, which is monetary value stored electronically and not linked to a bank account. If this money were denominated in Canadian dollars, who should issue it? Who should earn the seigniorage?13 The central bank, as it does today, or the private sector? What would the financial system look like in each case? The Bank needs to consider all these questions. Cash is a public good that many people still prefer, especially for smaller transactions.14\n\n>As we think about alternative futures, we have to envision a world in which people mostly use e-money, perhaps even one that\xe2\x80\x99s not denominated in a national currency, such as Bitcoin. This would create a new dynamic in the global monetary order, one in which central banks would struggle to implement monetary policy. And, central banks couldn\xe2\x80\x99t act as lenders of last resort as they do for their own currencies. This means that households and businesses could suffer important losses if such an e-money were to crash. We need to anticipate this and manage the risks and benefits that could arise from the broader adoption of e-money.\n\n>The Bank will explore these and many other trends over the course of our three-year corporate plan. To do this, we\xe2\x80\x99re expanding the range of techniques we use for analysis. For example, we\xe2\x80\x99ve begun to capitalize on \xe2\x80\x9cbig data\xe2\x80\x9d to do things that aren\xe2\x80\x99t possible with traditional economic statistics.
