And while saving may appear to be a brake on such adoption, I don\'t believe it is. It\'s just a matter of timing. No one will "save" Bitcoin forever, and at some point will start spending it.

[Hardware Backdoor's](http://www.darkreading.com/advanced-threats/black-hat-researcher-demonstrates-hardwa/240004674) are real and more prevalent than you can imagine.  The only way to be sure you aren't susceptible is to design and build your own CPU and computer system.  Fabricating your own silicon chips is a [surprisingly simple process](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GQmtITMdas), as all you really need is some sand.  \n\n>2.  Once you've hand manufactured your CPU, Motherboard, RAM, and IO devices, you'll need to write a C compiler that will compile down to your CPU's native language.  Writing your own compiler will keep you safe from the [Ken Thompson Hack](http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheKenThompsonHack).\n\n>3.  Create a simple OS that you can use to access the internet.  Some people might suggest using Linux, but there are 9,868,933 lines of code in just the Kernel, most of which you won't need, and personally verifying every line for [rootkits](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rootkit) might take a bit longer than you have the patience for.\n\n>4.  Create your own bitcoin client.  Satoshi's client could possess hidden back doors, or they could have been introduced since his departure.  The classic [create-a-currency-to-compromise-a-users-computer-attack](https://ripple.com/) is devastating, and we can't rule Satoshi out.  Bottom line is that you cannot be sure.\n\n>5.  Dig a very deep hole into the earth, and surround it with at least three feet of re-enforced concrete.  Place your custom PC in there. Thermal imaging attacks can easily penetrate the walls of your home, and reveal your private keys to any wayward onlooker, or high tech peeping tom.  A sufficiently deep hole will also protect you against common [keystroke sound vibration attacks](http://gcn.com/articles/2011/10/18/smart-phone-sensors-steal-keystrokes.aspx).  Also, if you've had any help so far, this hole will double as their grave. Loose ends are security holes.\n\n>6.  Before generating your public private key pair, carefully run your hands over your head to ensure that you don't have any suspicious electrodes attached to your skull.  [Mind Reading technology is real](http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2008/03/augcog-continue/).\n\n>7.  Once your wallet is setup, [Quantum Encrypt it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography) so that any attempts to access it will immediately destroy the information.  \n\n>8.  This is the most important: *Never leave your re-enforced hole in the ground*.

If the process of creating the paper wallet (as you described above) is truly secure, the only way to get to your private key is by either getting the piece paper or guessing it. Chance to brute guess is too low to be considered so the only way plausible way to get this private key is by acquiring your piece of paper. By creating many copies you've increased the chances of it falling into wrong hands. By encrypting it with BIP38 you did a good job. The password strength is the key here however. For the password to be truly secure you'd need it to be random and long (for comparison, private key is essentially 160 coin tosses secure). \n\nEssentially, now you 2 layers of security - physical security + encryption (password) security. By making many copies and giving them to other people you've made the physical layer a bit less secure. What you rely on is BIP38 password strength.

Essentially having 20+ random characters is hard to remember and is difficult and risky - so you'd need a paper backup for password (making whole BIP38 encryption meaningless). \n\nConclusion: Your security is good because you are combining physical and password security at the same time.

Use an algorithmic method instead to be sure.\n\nThe huge advantage of (natural language) word based passphrases is the relative ease with which even high entropy passphrases can be remembered by the human mind, and the very high error tolerance with which they are recorded - ever wondered if that password you wrote down years ago had a capital \'i\' at position 3 or a lower case \'L\'?

I think you deserve an answer, so if you\'re still interested, here is mine:\n\nYes, technically you need to read the source code of everything you run, to be sure what happens. Since websites don\'t get compiled, we have one problem less, you don\' have to care about binary files. But you still have to trust the machine (browser, OS, hard drive...) you run your code on. That\'s why people suggest the offline thing. \n\nBUT, back to the specific case of using bitaddress.org and your initial question about:\n> their algorithm producing predictable private keys\n\nYou don\'t have to trust their algorithm, you don\'t even need to use it. A bitcoin private key is simply a 256 bit number, often displayed as 64 characters in the range 0-9 or A-F.\nThat\'s all there is to it (Almost, for the details see: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Private_key. All zeros is not allowed, and as a safe rule of thumb: strings starting with more then 30 consecutive \'F\' characters are not allowed too.). \n\nYou can generate these 64 characters for yourself however you want^*. bitaddress.org comes into play after that: it helps you to get to the address and public keys from the private key (under "Wallet Details"). As long as this algorithm doesn\'t leak your private keys (-> offline pc), all evil it could do would be to produce invalid addresses, which you can check easily by test sending and spending with a small amount.\n\nKeep in mind, all this stuff is for people who want to "be their own bank", and are willing to make an effort to do that.\n\n^* You should use some random source for generating the characters tough, humans are not good with randomness. Dice for example are not bad with randomness: there have been a number of posts in this sub about generating keys with dice, if you enjoy this kind of stuff.\n\nEDIT: formatting\n': 2, 'I think [bitcoinpaperwallet.com](https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/) is pretty good.  \n\nGet the [html off of github](https://github.com/cantonbecker/bitcoinpaperwallet) and print it from a bootable ubuntu USB operating system if you want more security.': 2, 'wow! thanks!

The pyramid advertised itself as the bank of the rich which probably was true considering that many from the upper echelons of the ruling parasites had "special" interest arrangements nearing 10-11% interest! I realized that in an economic environment of depressed credit expansion, outflow capitals, collapsing real estate prices (nearly 40% from the top in 2008) there is no way on earth they could possibly sustain this kinds of interest payments and kept my ears and eyes open for the slightest of troubles with the rulers as to move my electronic debt based money promise out of them. That is what i did just 3 days before the pyramid was closed in June 2014 as news was spreading that the pyramid chief - Cvetan Vasilev, was in a row with one of the ruling parties (DPS) which is famous for staying in power ever since the collapse of the previous rulers regime - the red communists turned into newly baked crony-capitalists.\n\nThe total assets of the pyramid were over 3 billion euros, of which within the "guaranteed" electronic money was 2 billion. In the so called guarantee fund there were less than 2 billion after 17 years of collecting fees on the bank assets, for which the rulers took on a state debt to be payed by the tax slaves in the next couple of generations as to fulfill the "promise". Bulgaria is in a currency board to the euro since 1997, after the hyper inflationary collapse caused by 17 failed banks (orchestrated of course) that run away with 2.5billion dollars of value at the time, only 7 years after the change of the clothes of the previous rulers to a new kind with fancier ideas like "democracy for the masses". This is to show that in 2014 only one of the nearly 30 banking pyramids operating in the country, stole more than the previous 17 failed banks in 1997. As interest payments were MUCH higher in all banks because of the distorted market place by the bankrupt KTB pyramid, lots of hot money was flowing from depositors speculating by spreading their eggs in higher risk tax farms like bulgaria, ukraine, moldova, mongolia, turkey etc. Now, all this money flow has reversed and I expect that more pyramids are in trouble than most people realize and probably unless the rulers take a lot more debt, there will be a contagion in the months to come as things unravel. The latest big bank to come into the spotlight is FIB (or PIB, first investment bank) for which news is spreading with a huge credit exposure to very few companies and persons with total credits way above the 25% regulatory limit of all assets. FIB is the 3rd biggest bank and already received state liquidity last summer (600million euro) as there was a bank run affecting them and other bulgarian-owned banks, considering how fragile the confidence level is with any of those pyramids.\nWhat is funny the KTB owner is now in Serbia, as it is outside the EU empire and can not be extradited as easy as within it upon request. He has put a couple of a hundred million euros in companies in serbia, money stolen from depositors of course, and probably is under the protection of the serbian rulers as they seem to do everything possible to delay any extradition proceedings. Before the pyramid officially was closed, they boosted less than 2% default rate whereas in the other banks it is nearly 20% considering the real estate as collateral has gone down dramatically. Suddenly, after its closure the regulators at the central bank has published that it had over 50% default rate which was masked through new deposits coming in at the promise of high return and issuing new credits to the bad companies to repay bad loans and mask the whole think up! No normal wain person with leave his saved up toilet paper with any of the banks these days as there is in the air talks of overturning the currency board and hyper inflating the bad debt as they did in 1997.\n\ntl.dr: whoever has any brains is getting his money out of any bank in bulgaria as the political uncertainty is too great of a risk': 38, "Yeah, I remember reading about the bank run going on there a while ago.\n\nIt's not really a comparable situation to the Bitstamp hack it seems.": 2, 'To put that in perspective: 18k BTC is about 0.085% of the total Bitcoin that will ever be mined.': 2, "I would say she remains willfully and aggressively blind to bitcoin's benefits.
