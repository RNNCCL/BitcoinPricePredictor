Here\'s the way it works (simplified). I show up to your business, look at the first item on the B/S (which is always cash) and say "Okay good your saying you have 100 in cash". From there the client signs a letter authorizing me to talk to the bank. I send the bank a confirmation letter in one of two ways. \n\n1) Client Z says he has 100 can you confirm. \n\n2) What was client Z\'s balance as of 12/31/20XX. \n\nNormally I choose the second option, as it provides a touch more reassurance. Now I know what your thinking "wouldn\'t this be easier with the blockchain" sure would. However that saves all of 1 minute of audit time and 49c in postage.\n\nNow that\'s not all we do. Additionally I will look through the general ledger to look for suspicious transactions. Did someone record a debt to Cash and a Credit to an expense in an unexplained way? Has the company been doing bank recs daily, weekly, monthly? What is the internal control situation? Does one person do the rec, enter the payments, make JE\'s? If so then we could have an issue. \n\nNow keep in mind that\'s one account and only a few procedures, we still have other accounts that flow through to Cash Ie: AR, AP, Prepaid, PPE, S&W etc... and those accounts get checked as well. \n\nFurthermore, if my work is shoddy it will be caught by my partners, if not them; then during peer review. Any firm worth its weight in pig shit goes through peer review (David Friehling did not). Matter of fact I\'m sitting in a conference room right now, while another auditor from a different firm is combing our files, so naturally I\'m bored. \n\nIn short could the blockchain or blockchain like tech speed up an audit?

For each address that you control that contains bitcoins, all that's needed to access the bitcoins is the address' private key.\n\nKnowing that anyone who has your private keys can access your bitcoins anywhere in the world, the only safe way to store your bitcoins is to secure your private keys.  I recommend creating a paper wallet using an offline computer you can guarantee hasn't been compromised, and sending your bitcoin to that address.": 1, '> *Should I store them on my computer?\n\nNo.  I suggest storing them on a Trezor, which provides both secure storage and ease of access.': 1, '* I want to purchase bitcoins and start using them.

What is currently the best method for doing so?\n\nCurrently, I\'d say Coinbase is the best exchange to use. Although there are some limitations on how much you can buy "instantly", but they\'re by far the most trusted and secure exchange in the US. Your other option is localbitcoins.com and buying via cash deposit, just make sure the seller has a good reputation. However, you\'ll pay slightly higher on localbitcoins.com since you\'re dealing directly with sellers as opposed to the exchange itself.\n\n2) Should I store them on my computer? (keyloggers, hard drive crashes, malware) Should I store them on an online wallet? (giving up control of my bitcoins to a third party). What measures should I take to secure my ownership? (BitGo, USB key etc.)\n\nTo be honest, I wouldn\'t be too concerned about storing them online. I\'ve been using BTC for years and have kept them in my online wallets since day 1. Coinbase is definitely secure, and they are constantly enhancing their security. Just make sure you enable two-factor authentication, and don\'t leave your computer logged in to Coinbase when you\'re not around. \n\n3) Can someone convince me that entering a Bitcoin exchange is safe?\n\nCoinbase is a hugely profitable, transparent, VC-backed Bitcoin exchange. They\'ve worked with some of the biggest US companies to implementation BTC payment processing for them, and I\'ve been using them for two years now. Paypal is even working with Coinbase. \n\n4) How easily can I convert bitcoins back into USD in the US?\n\nWith Coinbase, you can literally convert back to dollars in an instant.\n \nHope I kept it as clear and straight forward as possible for you.': 3, '"Bitcoin can be useful when purchasing from Overstock.com, Tigerdirect, Newegg, and a few local shops on either coast"\n\nAnd more stores are added every day.\n\n\n"Bitcoin transactions take up to 10 minutes to process"\n\nNot necessarily. If you pay to a Coinbase account from a Coinbase wallet the transaction is off-chain and thus there\'s no waiting time.\n\n\n"Bitcoin is NOT anonymous when you make transactions, but no one can stop you from making them."\n\nBitcoin is SEUDONYMOUS. It references a cryptographic public key, but no personal information.\n\n\n"When you decide to enter a bitcoin exchange, you have to "give" your bitcoins to the exchange. And trust that when you decide to withdraw them from the exchange, they will be given back to you. (risky)"\n\nOnly if you are going to sell them. If you bought them you can withdraw right away.\n\n\n"At this point, getting into mining is not feasible at all unless you have access to a supercomputer."\n\nNot quite.

(keyloggers, hard drive crashes, malware) Should I store them on an online wallet? (giving up control of my bitcoins to a third party). What measures should I take to secure my ownership? (BitGo, USB key etc.)\n\nThe level of security should be appropriate for the value being stored.  You might feel comfortable walking the street with $80 cash in your wallet but maybe not with $800.   Paper wallets, printed from an offline computer system are among the easiest and cheapest methods to store more significant amounts.\n\n> Can someone convince me that entering a Bitcoin exchange is safe?\n\nMost all the people using Mt. Gox to buy bitcoins were not harmed.  Only those with funds there at the point the exchange folded lost their funds.    My point is that if an exchange has a decent reputation and you only use it for the duration of performing your transaction your odds of losing money to them are relatively low.   As soon as you complete your buy transaction, get your coins moved to a wallet where you control the keys.\n\n> How easily can I convert bitcoins back into USD in the US?\n\nThat\'s the easy part, due to Bitcoin transactions being non-repudiable once confirmed. In the U.S., Coinbase will send you an ACH transfer with the USD funds when you sell coins through them.  Want cash sooner?  If you have enough funds, you can get someone to do a cash deposit into your bank account using Bitcoin-Brokers.org   There\'s many other methods, thanks to LocalBitcoins.com, Bitcoin ATMs, etc.\n': 3, "* At this point, getting into mining is not feasible at all unless you have access to a supercomputer.\n\nEven a supercomputer is vastly unprofitable for the electricity used.  You'd need a dedicated ASIC and free electricity for it to be considered worthwhile nowadays.\n\n\n* I want to purchase bitcoins and start using them. What is currently the best method for doing so? How easily can I convert bitcoins back into USD in the US?\nCircle.com is probably easiest if you have access otherwise localbitcoins.com or an exchange like bitstamp.  Again all 3 are fairly easy to go from BTC back to USD if you have a bank account.\n\nBitcoin exchanges are relatively safe, just move your bitcoin out of them if you just want to purchase coins.  I.e. install Etherum on PC/mac or a good native wallet for iOS/Android.

To do this easily, you first need a way to transact with anyone effortlessly.  \n\nWhat a blockchain based identity system will resolve:\n\n- Transact using real names (similar to Facebook).  Eliminates need for QR codes, email addresses, etc.\n- Eliminates the needs for third party websites to require a username/password to login.  This will instantly eliminate the mass hacking and identity thefts of corporate websites (Target, Home Depot, etc.)\n- Enable effortless property transaction.  \n\nThe closest thing I've seen as a conceptual solution to this has been Keyhotee.

Intentions are not relevant -- only effects are.\n\nYou don\xc2\xb4t know. I don\xc2\xb4t know either. \n\nThis Bitcoin banning effect you are talking about is the result of your personal interpretation of the law. It means it is based on your personal beliefs, values, readings, opinions, and conclusions. \n\nIn Ecuadorian case: "The law is a statement of the sovereign will, manifested in the form prescribed by the Constitution, it commands, forbids or permits." Civil Code, Art. 1\n\nSo, you should not affirm that Bitcoin is banned, if law or regulations do not mention Bitcoin.\n\n * What is considered as "simulation of money and currency"?. Which ones are in this category?\n\n> It doesn\'t matter, because the article that covers that specific prohibition is not limited to simulations of money and currency.\n\nYes. Art. 98 is bigger than simulation, and of course simulation could matter for Bitcoin.\n\nBut, you didn\'t answered none of the two questions and it is a reason for it: There is no regulation about it, not even about how the law or the Council considers Bitcoin.\n\n * Could you affirm that law does not have legalization options for Bitcoin?\n\n> In case this answers it: yes, if the "Junta de Pol\xc3\xadtica y Regulaci\xc3\xb3n Monetaria y Financiera" decides to expressly authorize Bitcoin, then yes, Bitcoin would be legal to circulate (but still illegal to mine, see below). However, no other cryptocurrencies would be, until those currencies themselves are authorized.\n\nYes, the Council could make Bitcoin legal by resolution.\n\nI disagree about your conclusions about illegality of mining. Of course our commentaries are just opinions, but again law says nothing about mining. \n\n * As a curiosity about your knowledge. Could you tell us why a bank check is not considered as "simulation of money"?\n\n> Because they specifically define checks outside of that category. Read the law:\n\nThe law defines checks as mean of payment and that\xc2\xb4s all. But law doesn\xc2\xb4t talk about simulation exceptions, so you cannot affirm "they specifically define checks *outside of that category*".\n\nBut the central idea here is: **law defines it**. The same principle applies for prohibitions. (Ref. Civil Code, Art. 1)\n\n * Where is the word "prohibition" related to "Bitcoin" in the law?\n\n> Right there, they\'re telling you that no transaction is allowed to be denominated in Bitcoin. So, unlike, say in America, you don\'t have the freedom to transact on Bitcoin. But you may say, hey, perhaps you can fix the price and the bill in dollars, right, and then you pay with Bitcoin? Yeah, not so fast:\n\nYes, Art. 94 is clear, as clear as Art. 14-39. ;)\n\nYou quoted Art. 98, but it doesn\'t mention Bitcoin. Again, is the law considering Bitcoin ilegal?. Or, is it your personal interpretation about it?\n\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nThere is a risk that Bitcoin could be considered illegal based on Art. 98. I assume it is the idea you want to transmit. In that way, I agree with you, but it is different to affirm "Bitcoin is banned in Ecuador".\n\nIn fact, the law gives the Council legal attributions to make Bitcoin legal or illegal. I don\xc2\xb4t know a legal system that allows people define prohibition or legality. It is the law and regulation those who determine prohibition. I assumed that you don\xc2\xb4t know about our legal system so here are some clues:\n\n  1. Ecuadorian Legal system comes from Civil Law specifically the Latin-Roman system. Codes and statutes are the main source of law and are designed to cover all eventualities.\n\n  2. Judges are interpreters of the law and, compared with Common Law system, our judges have a more limited role applying the law. In our system every norm should be written.\n\n  3. Legislative branch creates the law, and institutions appointed in the law create complementary norm through its regulation attributions.\n\n  4. The law is a statement of the sovereign will, manifested in the form prescribed by the Constitution, it commands, forbids or permits.\n\nIn conclusion, Monetary Council is the entity designed by Monetary Code to create regulation in that matter. The Council can easily ban Bitcoin because they have the legal attributions to do it. But until today, I cannot affirm that Bitcoin is permited in Ecuador, in the same way you should not affirm that Bitcoin is banned in Ecuador. \n\nIf you are willing to affirm the "banning of bitcoin in Ecuador", please wait for a law or resolution related to Bitcoin. Otherwise you are free to express your opinions, but please do not make a speculative assertion without mention that it is your personal opinion. \n\nLaw has its own mechanisms.': 1}, ('USA Today Money section article', 149): {"What they're showing in the picture is a [Piper](http://cryptographi.com/pages/what-is-piper).
