I don't believe that Satoshi would do something rash that would destroy his very own creation\xc2\xa0(such as plummeting the price by selling as many of his coins as possible). Plus, tech innovators are usually rewarded handsomely for their inventions. For example, Steve Jobs probably owned 10% of Apple shares at one point in time, and Mark Zuckerberg probably owned 10% of Facebook shares at one point. But I could be wrong about all of this -- maybe we SHOULD be concerned that he owns 10% of the coins?!": 1, 'What "perverse incentive"? Have you actually taken the time to understand their arguments, or are you just speaking blindly? You\'ve been making your position known on the forum for a while now, but I see no development of your understanding of the other side.\n\nTheir argument is that the current technology cannot scale hugely without centralizing the network (by increasing node hosting requirements) too much, and that this centralization is ultimately harmful for Bitcoin WRT retaining its defining characteristics, namely independence from the current system. How do these things relate? If hosting a node is too onerous, then instead of decentralized nodes we\'ll have fewer nodes hosted by powerful data centers. This makes the network more centralized, hence more vulnerable to political or corporate influence (whether for the reason of competition, or laws to try to regulate bitcoin transactions just like Visa or MasterCard, or create whitelists and blacklists of coins).\n\nI\'m not saying I agree that a simple block increase to 20MB (for example) will cause such a huge effect on centralization (my position lies in between, since there are pros and cons to both sides -- e.g. I agree that transaction fees should ideally be kept \'low\', however that is defined), but the argument is certainly sound and can be debated without alluding to "perverse incentives" (thereby implicitly accusing those making the argument of having ulterior motives that are not in Bitcoin\'s interest, which is an outrageous accusation to make re: Blockstream, considering their work). That argument is like someone who accuses another of not being a "patriot" just because the other is questioning the way forward.\n\nIt\'s extremely disappointing that you would say such things, given the good you\'ve done for Bitcoin previously with your YouTube videos and how you seemed to understand Bitcoin\'s benefits at a deeper level (benefits that are indeed threatened if Bitcoin\'s decentralization is degraded too much).\n\nP.S. As an example, I tried to debate Luke Jr on this issue (https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3afd5e/major_payment_processors_in_favor_of_block_size/csceufp) to see why he seems to support higher fees, lower user adoption, etc. instead of bigger blocks, and at least according to him the reason is that current software cannot yet scale in a decentralized fashion. I\'m still pondering what he said and trying to decide if I agree, and how to respond to this, but my point is these are legitimate concerns. There is no reason to marginalize legitimate views in a bullying or mocking manner; Bitcoin certainly will not become stronger with such an approach.': 2, 'p.s.

Thank you!': 1, 'Satoshi said vision was to premined 10% of the coins then leave, stop worshipping him': -2, 'The counterargument is that a huge centralization of nodes does not matter, as you only need one honest node. It is okay if Bitcoin is run with just 100 nodes, with a system where new nodes are untrusted for a period of X days and gradually build more "reputation" based on them relaying info. Initially the client will warn you if it is not connected to at least 4 trusted nodes, preventing Sybil attacks without a long term investment.\n\nIt is okay if only servers in data centers can run full nodes. Satoshi designed bitcoin this way - for almost everyone to use spv.': 2, 'Thank you for the compliments, and you are right -- it is not fair for me say "perverse incentives", because it does seem like they want to keep Bitcoin decentralized too. This is actually a trickier & more nuanced issue than I made it seem.\n\nMy concern in this debate is the exact same concern as yours: keeping the network as decentralized as possible. That is of the utmost importance to me. \n\nYet if the block size stays at 1 MB, it seems to me that this actually INCREASES centralization because it pushes most of the transactions to centralized companies that process off-chain transactions. That concerns me because with the majority of these off-chain networks, you are not in control of your own keys  anymore, which makes it about as centralized as you can get! ;) Plus, we\'ve already seen some censorship & tracking of transactions with Coinbase. So, we\'re right back to a Paypal-like world again.\n\nSo if we kept a small block size but Bitcoin adoption increases, it seems to me that people will be forced to use these off-chain networks, because normal peer-to-peer transactions on the "real blockchain" might not get confirmed for a day, 2 days, maybe even 3 or 4 days or longer. And if the transactions are not getting confirmed for a while but people still want to use the real blockchain, it seems to me that people would bump up their fees to try to get their transactions confirmed quickly. But if it gets too expensive, people will either (a) turn to other non-Bitcoin payment methods which could cause Bitcoin adoption to fall (i.e. back to credit cards again), or (b) turn to these off-chain Paypal-like services. \n\nI\'m actually not totally opposed to all of these off-chain services (for example, I love ChangeTip!!), but I think everyone should have the choice whether they want to transact off-chain or on-chain. \n\nGavin said that he doesn\'t believe that a 20 MB block would increase centralization. He believes that the increased cost of mining a 20 MB block (vs. a 1 MB block) at this point is only about $20 or $30 more per month, which shouldn\'t increase centralization by much (if at all). Gavin also believes that with the increase in bandwidth & CPU over the next 5-10 years, that this minimal extra cost will dwindle to almost nothing. So he believes that if you extrapolate bandwidth & CPU trends into the future, that in about 5 or so years, the average home computer should be able to process every single transaction as full nodes, even with a 20 MB blocksize, which would still keep things very decentralized.\n\nBut as you implied, this is not a completely cut-and-dry issue.

If it doesn't provide a net compelling proposition to any key factions in major governments, they will restrict it and it will fall on other governments to be Bitcoin havens and make every other state envious of their economic advancement to the point where they revise their decisions.\n\nThe reason I think Bitcoin will win is simple: it cycles the [OODA loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA_loop) faster than governments possibly can.

If demand surges, then blocks shrink. Remember, **blocks are made of transactions, transactions are sent by users**. Less demand = smaller blocks, higher demand = bigger blocks.  That's why it's dangerous to squeeze it into the artificial limit set 5 years ago, when blocks were only 300 bytes large.": 1, 'Oh, good. Somebody finally bringing sound economic theory to bear on the problem.': 8, 'OP\'s entire premise is based on a strawman argument. That the limit ought to be raised doesn\'t mean it\'s safe to lock Bitcoin into 8GB blocks in 2037.

They can at best make you "feel good" about them, and assuage with very high figures, here\'s what\'s 99% good to happen, here\'s what\'s 50% good to happen.\n\nIn this case though, the decision being made potentially results in cataclysmic failure of Bitcoin to remain free of state control, which is to say the entire point of Bitcoin\'s decentralization is being put at jeopardy. How soon could cracks in Moore\'s Law or Nielsen\'s Law lead to dramatically less true P2P participation in the network? No one can know for sure, and that\'s where you lose everyone in the XT camp. They think true P2P participation is doomed, usually because they can\'t imagine Bitcoin QT being user-friendly. There\'s no reason why it can\'t be made to function similarly to AntiVirus software. Imagine: if average internet connection speeds really *are* 140 MB/s in the year 2037, fantastic. At those rates, you could sync the entire Bitcoin blockchain in 6 minutes flat. And before then? You could use SPV mode. After? You could decide pruning is for you, and now the cost incurred on your home desktop is truly minimal.\n\nBut that is all speculation on my part. Predicting great technological boons in the future is easy, what\'s hard to get 100% right 100% of the time, is the timing of any of these events. It\'s like predicting the price of Bitcoin. No one has any clue what the price will be in 7 days, but we can get together some tea leaves, and feel pretty good rubbing our hands together over the Magic 8 Ball. TA doesn\'t even make sense in financial markets. Past trends are not predictive of the future. Why does it make sense to do that with Bitcoin, **when the very reason for the block size limit is to vaccinate Bitcoin against the type of attack that makes running full nodes impossible to do on home computers**.\n\n> And there rests the burden of proof\n\nNo. Block size limit isn\'t about active attacks, it\'s about managing risk for when attacks do happen, which can\'t be predicted, and certainly not when we\'re predicting 20 years out from today.\n\nThat your home computer can\'t keep up with 8GB blocks hitting it every 10 minutes using today\'s hardware is common knowledge. What Gavin\'s proposal does is it sets a ticking time bomb. Now, before the year 2036 Moore\'s Law or Nielsen\'s Law may show some cracks. Nothing is set in stone, we just have past data trends, but trends are not predictive. Yet demand for an international currency of fixed supply could have surged by 2036, in which case we will be left with a network outright *impossible* for any medium sized business, let alone an *individual*, to handle on a home computer.\n\nWhat does that do to Bitcoin as an evolution of currency?\n\nIf only ISPs can run Bitcoin because it was "attacked" by foes or by natural user demand after unvaccinating itself against just such an attack, is that the bedrock of the true evolution of currency? I contend that NO, it is very much something different from the evolution of currency. It\'s something that started nice, but didn\'t quite get all the way there. Maybe it wins a silver metal, but a *more* trustless currency has more intrinsic value. I am willing to say such a currency engineered by /u/nullc would be superior to any currency sufficiently large as to be *inaccessible* by the common man on a home computer.\n\nOutsourcing to some intermediary is great when it saves resources, but it isn\'t worth basing your currency on that. In the worst case scenario, this intermediary is SkyNet. All manner of attacks become possible if, failures for Moore\'s Law to hold or cracks in Nielsen\'s Law rear their ugly hands.

I think youtube is a good resource too.  You can find some good [resources here](https://bitcoin.org/en/resources) for news and information.  Mainstream news about Bitcoin can often be misleading or wrong.\n\nAs for mining, its very difficult to be competitive these days.  It might take significant investment and knowledge and is always a risk that you may lose money.  Usually people don't recommend it for newbies.  However you could do it as a fun hobby if you want as well, and who knows if you become an expert at it over time, maybe you can be successful with the right amount of investment and timing.\n\nThe massive amount of computing power is not just wasting energy.  It is securing a global worldwide immutable ledger and allowing this new technology to exist.  There are other ways to secure ledgers that may or may not be better.  Bitcoin uses Proof of Work.  Look into Proof of Stake (POS) if you want to learn another way in which a ledger can be secured without miners.\n\nBitcoin is not perfect of course.  There are flaws with anything.  It can be tracked easily, and if you are not careful you may not have a lot of privacy on your transactions.  Also there are 10 minute confirmation times, which makes it harder for some brick and mortar transactions, because of the increase risk of double spends.  The block size debate is a big issue right now as well.  \n\nI think that Bitcoin is improving on those flaws over time.  The advancement of sidechains, and also confidential transactions could solve a lot of the problems of helping Bitcoin to scale, and also providing more privacy and tools to protect against being tracked.  The lightning network could help provide much faster transactions.\n\nSure you can lose your private key and your coins are gone forever.  But people lose cash in housefires, or gold on sunken ships.  This happens with lots of forms of money.  Bitcoin is divisible to at least 8 decimal places (and possibly further), so the amount in circulation does not much matter.\n\nIf I were you I would just dip your toe in a bit.  Buy a small amount, maybe 20 dollars worth.  Get a coinbase or circle account and link your bank account.  Then you can purchase bitcoin.

Computers crash, people leave a few bits on an old wallet, there is even a guy who threw out a computer in 2012ish that had 1000BTC on it.

Bitcoin is almost 7 years old if there was a truly terminal flaw in it it would have happened by now.\n\n5. Yes that's true. You do not actually hold bitcoin, the coins themselves are held in the blockchain, so technically anyone who is running a full node has all currently mined bitcoins on their computer. What you hold are the access codes, called a private key. If you lose that, those bitcoins are stuck in that wallet forever, and can never be unlocked. What happens to the value? Well if those coins were already just sitting there anyway, they were already illiquid, so nothing really. Its really the same thing as a ship carrying gold bullion sinking.\n\n6.

His whole contention is that disruption is a very very short-lived event once it reaches critical mass (around about now); after that there is economic realignment whereby a lot of things are shifted about ... so for a period of time there\'s a currency such as Bitcoin, there\'s one such as Etherium (for other purposes mainly to do with consensus-economies such as political economies where voting is taking place or candidates are fund-raising) and then finally there is the dollar, sterling etc. as well as gold (gold only for a little bit before it becomes worth the value of its technological capability only - whatever that is likely to be). \n\nAccording to Harrison\'s Factory Banking hypothesis, this realignment period is ultimately usurped and replaced by another period - Economic Genesis. It\'s a genesis because effectively it\'s a whole new beginning, and in this world there\'s Bitcoin as the intermediary, there\'s the Etherium-type currency used in political / campaign economics, and there is sovereign currency but only represented as digital sovereign (which is still used for buying everyday goods). Bitcoin\'s fractional quality is, according to the hypothesis set out in Factory Banking, what makes it ideal as the intermediary between the physical and the virtual world - a kind of automatic exchange rate that looks more like an interest rate than anything else. Because on one side you have a whole host of traditional currencies, on the other you got loads of virtual currencies, and both of them are constantly inflating as the Internet of Things starts kick-starting the economic engine into overdrive. So what do you do? Have constant inflation volatility?

Suppose that the cartel has 60% of the hashpower:\n\n+ Cartel posts their modified version (B) of the software; tells everybody that they had better upgrade before date T or their coins will be frozen.  "This change is crucial for the safety and stability of bitcoin" etc etc.\n\n+ Until date T, both the old version (A) and the new version (B) behave identically.\n\n+ On date T, the new version of the software switches to the modified protocol, with a clean hard fork (wallets, new transactions, and new blocks that are valid for A software are invalid for B, and vice versa).  The coin splits into bitcoin-A and bitcoin-B, initially with the same state, but with independent branches of the blockchain, that can be  operated with the proper version of the software.\n\n+ The cartel divides their 60% hashpower into two teams: the "saboteurs" and the "workers" with 45% and 15% of the total hashpower, respectively.  The saboteurs keep mining the old branch A of the chain, but ignore any block that the "honest" A-miners find and mines only empty blocks on top of their own empty blocks.  Since the saboteurs have 45% of the power and the honest A-miners have only 40%, even if the latter manage to mine a few blocks they will be eventually orphaned.\n\n+ Meanwhile, the cartel "workers" mine the B-branch.  The B-version of the software will have a temporary difficulty adjustment that will ensure a reasonable block rate even with that reduced hashpower.\n\nClients, nodes, and miners who have upgraded to the B version will continue using their coins normally, except perhaps for some temporary variations in the block rate.  Exchanges and other services that have upgraded can be used by their B-clients with no problems. A-clients can still execute trades inside B-exchanges, but wil be unable to deposit, and if they withdraw they will receive only B-coins on the B-chain, that they will not see until they upgrade too. \n\nClients who are still using version A will see their transactions sit in the queues indefinitely; or be confirmed for a few  blocks, then become unconfirmed again.  If they upgrade, they fill find their (B-)coins still where they were before the fork.  If an A-client receives a payment from a B-client, the B-coins will be moved but the A-client will not see them until he upgrades too. Miners who are still mining the A-branch will see any blocks that they mine become orphans, so they will not get any revenue.  Exchanges and wallet services that do not upgrade see all deposits or withdrawals blocked.  Both A and B clients will be able to trade in an A-exchange, but will be unable to withdraw, until the exchange upgrades too.\n\nTheferore, the best choice of any A-player is to upgrade, the sooner the better.  Miners who are not part of the cartel will want to upgrade too, the sooner the better.  As miners upgrade to the B version, the cartel will shift his power from the saboteurs to the workers so as to maintain a majority of the hashpower on each chain.\n\nA change like delaying the next halving will have no effect on the working of bitcoin, so if the PR is done properly, all clients and services will upgrade -- most before the fork, the rest shortly afterwards -- so the price of the B-coin should be close to that of  the original bitcoin before the announcement.  Meanwhile the A-coin will be left practically without miners but with the difficulty in the stratosphere, so it will be dead.\n\nThis is a self-reinforcing attack.  once the players get convinced that the attack *may* succeed (and, as long as the cartel has the majority of the hashpower, it will), they will upgrade before the fork, thus helping the attack to suceed.': 3, 'The cartel can jam the "rebel" chain no matter how it mutates.  \n\nMoreover, if a minority of the miners can prevail over a majority, the most essential principle of the protocol is being grossly violated.

I think not.  Your argument against BTC is that it is not A FIAT MONEY - otherwise nationally recognized as having any country backing and thus has no \'full faith and credit\' from an underlying sovereign entity - that has nothing to do with whether or not it can work as a suitable vehicle to pay rent expense.  Had you argued "Bitcoin can never replace traditional banking systems because fractional reserve systems can float on adjusted credit balances and can lend \'lines of credit\'", I would concur with you - cryptocurrency is irreversible and lending irreversible money is dangerous - due to the exceptionally high risk of loan defaults (we can\'t just generate new BTC from thin air - that\'s effectively no longer cryptocurrency).  \n\nObviously it makes little sense to base a lease agreement in BTC at this time.  If I were to agree to pay you 8 BTC per month and suddenly BTC price jumps back to $300 or even $400 - I\'ve now lost the potential purchasing power of previously spent coin (@ $400 I\'m  Now paying you an equivalent overage of $1200 USD, you would probably like that or would potentially hate the idea of BTC dropping in value - I\'m taking it that someone proposed BTC for rent to you last year and ever since you\'ve looked at the price and see it drop and think, oh no, this is a terrible idea because its a junk currency that cannot retain value).  As a landlord - you should be happy to get whatever rents you can.  I\'m presuming you either work with a management company or you take money orders - either case, taking bitcoin as a landlord would actually open you up to potentially more tenants -again, bitcoin is real money because we, individuals choose to accept it for our goods and services - aggregately bitcoin has the full faith and credit of all other bitcoin users, enforced by consensus and proof of work - don\'t like the volatility - then convert it back to fiat.
