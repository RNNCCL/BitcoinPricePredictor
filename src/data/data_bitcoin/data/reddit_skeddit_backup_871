When Bitcoin is exchanged for Sterling or for foreign currencies, such as Euros or Dollars, no VAT will be due on the value of the Bitcoins themselves.\n\n4.

So you can only stop a 51% if you detect it in advance before the full 51% is reached?\n\nRight, so notice I already discussed that in my above comment. But to clarify, if you have a 51% delegate attack, or you have a 51% stake attack (which then allows the attacker to vote for 100% of their own delegates), the hard fork mechanism is necessary to resolve the attack.\n\n> What if the attacker specifically want to disrupt the network, with the aim to cause the need for manual hardfork concensus so often that it gets abandoned? Bitcoin recovers automatically the second the 51% PoW attack ends (you can hardfork earlier there too of deemed necessary by the majority), PoS doesn\'t.\n\nSo for a 51% stake attack, the cost of an attack is much more expensive than a 51% POW attack. Also, in the hard fork, the honest users can identify and purge the bad stake pretty easily (identify balances voting for known evil delegates). This means the attacker essentially pays a huge sum of money (half the market cap) to all the honest actors for the inconvenience of the hard fork. The attacker would be bled dry fairly quickly.\n\nFor a 51% delegate attack (meaning simultaneously having control of at least 51 of the 101 delegates), the purge is doable as well but might be unacceptable by the community depending on how the delegates were compromised. If they were good delegates that had their private keys simultaneously compromised, I would imagine the hard fork would be designed to not purge anything, just kick the compromised delegates out and let the network resume with new delegates. In this case, the cost to the attacker is not as great (whatever the cost is of doing a simultaneously attack on 51 servers spread across the world, which isn\'t trivial, as well as the opportunity cost of not collecting the delegate income). However, the important question to ask is if the cost is less than or more than the cost of a 51% POW attack. I would argue it would be easier to continually compromise the top mining pools to temporarily disrupt the Bitcoin network until people lose confidence in it (we are talking state actors here because they are the only ones with the resources to pull this sort of attack off). Since you can take more than 51% of hash power by just going after the top 3 Bitcoin mining pools, but you require going after 51 delegates to compromise DPOS, I would argue DPOS is more secure from these kind of attacks.\n\nAnd if an attacker does control more than 51% of hash power (say the government seized control of a bunch of ASICs), it is not at all easy for the good guys to take back control. They would have to purchase additional ASICs faster than the attacker could (and they would have to afford the electricity costs of running it). This would lead to a much longer disruption to users than a 51% attack on DPOS. And the fact is mining will always become centralized because of economies of scale. So, it is not fair to compare to a hypothetical case of the attacker needing to seize an ASIC from every home. The reality is as Bitcoin mining becomes more centralized in the future (due to economics), it becomes easier for an state actor to steal control of majority hash power.\n\n> In particular, network fragmentation is one of the major risks with PoS as anybody capable of creating a valid block can create 2 or more and send them to different parts of the network. There\'s no non-disruptive way of effectively and quickly settle on one fork. There\'s no single metric that says "this fork is better" that can be trusted when under attack.\n\nI\'m not sure if you are talking about the case where 51% or more of the delegates are compromised, or in the regular scenario. In the compromised case, with the victim\'s network isolated from the world, the victim would also have no way of knowing if the given POW chain is good or not. In the case of DPOS under normal operation, a user will know within one round of 101 blocks (approximately 17 minutes) whether they are on a majority chain or not. If they are on a majority chain, then they are on the consensus chain (unless the majority of delegates are compromised and their internet connection is isolated by the attacker). If they are on a minority chain, their client will know this and can tell the user to not trust transactions for goods/services until the network is back to normal. The reality is though, that under normal conditions, one can just wait for one block (10 seconds) and be very confident (more confident than waiting for one block confirmation in Bitcoin) that the transaction will not become invalid due to a fork. \n\n': 2, "> The Bitcoin mining pools only need headers to mine.\n\nThe mining pool operators still need the whole block to verify the transactions included in them and to collect the coinbase. As the Bitcoin network scales, they will need bigger and more reliable pipes as well.

I would have to now either simply hold it (and watch it bleed value) or try to find an alternative altcoin based off POW schemes, in hopes of catching a spike up (when the pump occurs).  However, guess what...I am not an insider so I don't know the timing (how can I?).  \n\nNow let us imagine that we instead have a choice to get PTS and hold them long term.  Guess what we get.  Let's look:  every altcoin dev who is working for/with Invictus will release DACs and issue a small portion of the share s to *me*.  So in essence, it is like having bitcoin and instead of all the pump and dump schemes I get a stake in all the altcoins that branch off of it...including their potential innovations.  Bitcoin is for speculators...PTS is for longterm thinkers who don't want to play in the jungle day in and day out.  It is a brilliant model.  \n\nPeople will invest and divest in these tokens so the whole idea of FED reserve 2.0 is crazy...and that isnt even consider audit has not been done on the many many years.

You can change your vote at any time by sending your money to yourself.

The idea is that this process will prevent a majority of evil delegates from accumulating.\n\nIn the worst case scenario where a majority of active delegates collude or are simultaneously compromised in some way, and they decide to reject any transactions that vote them out, the stakeholders of the system need to resort to a hard fork. The stakeholders can still use their voting power to reach a consensus that a particular fork (with certain delegates replaced) is the one to continue on. The initial suggestion of which delegates to replace can be facilitated through outside social consensus mechanisms (for example developers and lead figures in the community all publishing the same link that uses URI scheme to communicate the fork parameters to the users' clients).  The hope is that this option will never be necessary because its very existence as an option makes it futile for an attacker to do this (they only temporarily disrupt the network, they don't permanently kill it, and at the opportunity cost of losing future delegate income).

You can think of Bitcoin's consensus model as delegated proof of work. Miners delegate their hash power to mining pools that produce the blocks. Delegated proof of stake (DPOS) delegates stakeholders' stake to active delegates who produce the blocks on their behalf. The stakeholders remain in control because they can vote in/out delegates at any time using their stake. The added security comes from the fact that attackers need to buy a majority of stake rather than a majority of hash power to take over the network, and buying a majority of stake is far more expensive. The efficiency comes from the fact that holding stake is free, but mining costs a lot of electricity. Because the active delegates are known, if they double sign blocks, they will be fired and lose future income, which is what protects this POS system from Nothing-at-Stake attacks. \n\nBitAssets are even more complicated to explain. I will not attempt to explain it well in this post. The general idea is that it allows people who want *price stability* forgo any potential rise (or decline) in the price of BTSX (the equivalent of BTC for the BitShares X DAC) by trading their BTSX for a BitAsset. The other side of this trade is a short that locks up the BTSX along with their own added margin as collateral to back the BitAsset debt they owe to the network. These people who short take part in this transaction because they believe the price of BTSX is going to go up relative to the BitAsset and they want *leverage* to maximize their gains (but it also means they are at risk of higher losses if the price goes down as well). The system is designed like a prediction market so that the market consensus forces the value of BitAssets to track the value of the underlying asset. Finally, the network enforces margin calls if necessary so that there is always BTSX of sufficient value backing the issued BitAssets (barring black swan events). The end result of all of this is hopefully a derivative market-pegged to the value of its underlying which is backed in value with BTSX without counterparty risk (which is very different than the other IOU assets that currently exist in other altcoins). Keep in mind that BitAssets are a new financial experiment and therefore very risky. However, the peg has been holding up okay so far despite buggy clients and low demand for BitUSD (since no merchants accept it yet). \n\nIf anyone wants to have a calm, rational discussion about these topics, I am happy to answer questions to the best of my ability.

": 3, "Then it's a turd, amiright?": 2, "It's a leveraged betting market based upon itself that will run as long as there is no sudden 50%+ drop in prices (margin calls happen at ~34% drops, liquidation at 50%).\n\nAfter that: chaos, despair, cascading liquidations and many tears.\n\nWhat would be interesting is to calculate the failure point live from the information available (after all, it should be all public info?).": 2, "I hear what you are saying, and many shitcoins are hiding behind complexity to make it sound like something legit is going on. But people outside of the crypto space essentially say the same thing about Bitcoin. In the end you need to do your own research. If someone is interested in BitsharesX, I highly recommend listening to interviews with the founder, Daniel Larimer. He isn't hiding behind a lot of technobabble, the concepts behind BitsharesX are relatively straightforward, they just don't seem that way initially because they are rooted in financial theories and economics which are often counter intuitive. The only sketchy thing is the extent to which some people in that community seem to be trying to pump it recently, particularly the DPoS algorithm as somehow inherently superior to Bitcoin.  ": 1, "The data feeds need to be integrated into Bitshares to properly function.  This is some kind of manual intervention.  This cannot be done by magic.  You need to convert price of gold to price in Bitshares.  This is not something that can be automated.\n\nBitcoin does not depend on Bitcoins having any value at all.  It has less difficulty in that it is far more liquid than BitsharesX as well.  LOL @ Bitshares meaning you avoid taxes.  I mean it's like a Swiss Bank Account, right?!  LOL Bitshares propoganda.": 1, 'If it looks like a turd, and smells like a turd..': 4, '> What is it?\n\nThink of it as a decentralized exchange, meaning an exchange which uses a block chain. When you trade on the exchange, everything you trade is kind of like a "fake" version of its respective real life asset. So, for example, when you purchase bitcoins on the exchange, you are really only getting "fake bitcoins". These fake bitcoins have their price pegged to real bitcoins and you can trade them on the exchange. This makes Bitshares a kind of predictions market, where the price of bitcoin is what is being gambled on, some people who think it is going to go up, some who think it is going to go down. However, unlike traditional predictions markets, the assets being bet on -- in this case bitcoins -- have actual tokens associated with them which can be traded. That is, these "fake bitcoins" can be traded just like any other cryptocoin. This is why Bitshares is sometimes referred to as a decentralized bank, because they are essentially providing a way to expand the Bitcoin money supply, where actual bitcoins are like m0 money, and fake bitcoins are like m1 money. When you purchase bitshares, you are essentially buying partial ownership of BitsharesX, and my understanding is that all profits from the exchange are distributed to shareholders of the exchange. \n\nSorry for the sloppy and incomplete explanation. I have to run, and haven\'t looked incredibly closely at BitsharesX, so I am not sure how accurate my explanation is. Hopefully this is more helpful, however, than some of the other responses you have gotten. ': 2, "You have to trust the data feeds, which come from the same feeds used by major banking institutions I would assume, so if they aren't accurate the whole global financial system is in trouble.\n\nAs far as the risks that come from Bitshares plummeting in value, like I said the bitassets are liquidated when movement in either direction tests the contract. Now it is still possible, if unlikely, that an asset or bitshares themselves, will plummet so quickly that the bitasset can't be liquidated fast enough. This could create a small or massive problem, no one knows, though there has been a lot of theoretical consideration of the problem. Bottom line is, that is how banking works, there are risks inherent in it. I mean, yes, to the extent the banking system itself is a scam you could say that of BitsharesX, but that doesn't equate with what I mean when I think of a shitcoin scam. \n\n> The whole thing depends on BitsharesX having value, which is a mighty big assumption.\n\nAnd Bitcoin depends on bitcoins having value. The global financial system depends on dollars having value . . .  \n\nBut I understand what you are saying. The main difficulty with BitsharesX is that the very thing that makes it attractive -- namely that it is a way of storing your wealth and avoiding the volatility of, say, Bitcoin -- is undermined by the uncertainty inherent in the project. As you say, if BitsharesX just falls apart, all those bitassets fall with it. It is attractive the idea of converting your bitcoins into USD to avoid the risk associated with bitcoin and to lock in your financial gains, but every time you do that you have to pay taxes. Using BitsharesX you could avoid taxes entirely, however you don't really avoid the risk because BitsharesX itself is so risky. I suspect this is why they mostly sell it as an exchange at this point, rather than as a bank, where you can short commodities like bitcoin, rather than trying to sell it as a safe place to store your bitcoin. Someday that might change. ": 1, "Bitcoin always had value, the value was in the technology. However, now we have many altcoins that use the same technology, so the intrinsic value is no longer intrinsic as it were. Bitcoin could, theoretically, go to zero, at which point no one would mine it and thus no one could actually trade it. I'm sure there must be bitcoin clones that have already suffered the same fate. \n\n>  LOL @ Bitshares meaning you avoid taxes. I mean it's like a Swiss Bank Account, right?!

": 1, 'Pegged assets with escrow?': 1, 'I can confirm they also troll twitter pretty heavily and will harass people who disagree with their views ': 4, 'I\'ve listened to the concepts.  They are complete babble and are completely debunked.  I remember hearing the first conception of it something like 2 years ago, thinking "wow, this would be great if it could actually work", then the problem is it doesn\'t work.  See the User-backed escrow section here - http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/mastercoin-is-a-nightmare-of-insanity/\n\nIt\'s about Mastercoin but it\'s the same insanity.': 1, 'Yeah, I was specifically talking about that section of the article. None of it really applies to BitsharesX. Look, I\'m not trying to be a BitsharesX apologist here, I just don\'t see how anything he says applies to BSX. I\'m suspect of whether his arguments really apply to Mastercoin either, but I don\'t know. \n\nEssentially what he is saying is that pegged assets with escrow doesn\'t work in theory with Mastercoin because A) there is no reason to trust the data feeds; B) there is nothing inherently making the connection between the asset and the token, so why should anyone treat the token as representative of the asset; and C) that even if people trust the asset/token connection it will easily be manipulated. \n\nBut when you really boil it down, what he is complaining about is B -- that there isn\'t anything intrinsically connecting the asset to the token. He is assuming a system which just sort of declares, by fiat, that token "virtualgold" now represents gold, and that is all it does. He is essentially asking how can we expect anyone to respect this declaration. \n\nBitsharesX doesn\'t work that way. "Virtualgold" is created in BitsharesX when two traders bet on gold with opposite expectations. It isn\'t just created out of thin air and declared to be equal to 1 ounce of gold -- the way the author assumes is the case in Mastercoin -- two mutually opposing traders create it by putting their money together (their bitshares) and creating a contract. That contract is "this token is redeemable at any time for 1 ounce of gold worth of bitshares". That becomes the virtualgold asset, it is backed by the money the two traders put into the contract. If at any time the price of gold plummets such that it is approaching a point where there isn\'t enough money held in the contract to back the asset, the asset is immediately liquidated by the system. So the asset is always worth exactly 1 ounce of gold, payable in bitshares.\n\nI assume Mastercoin wanted to set up something similar, only backing assets with mastercoins, though I am not sure about that, so I can\'t really speak to the author\'s criticism of mastercoin per se.
