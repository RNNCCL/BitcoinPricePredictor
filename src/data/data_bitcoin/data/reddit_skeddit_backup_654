Most of us have been there, if not scammed, we have some failed projects or paths we took that somewhere within it we felt trapped and just couldn\'t walk away. Its called ["sunk cost fallacy"](http://www.lifehack.org/articles/communication/how-the-sunk-cost-fallacy-makes-you-act-stupid.html)\n\nThe brain is astonishing at many things, including fooling itself into believing what it wants, especially if its wrapped up in something interesting and meaningful (shout-out to all them religions out there)\n\nNow, Im not expert at paycoin. But what I do hear just bings all the warning bells and imo a solid case could be made against almost all alternative crypto currencies. There just isn\'t a market for it, (apart from speculation) and Bitcoin who has near 100% of the "actually used for its purpose market" will continue to develop on it self and improve, with a hoard of nice and talented people who contribute solely for the betterment of it.\n\nAt the core of all this is, decentralization.\n\nIts the heart of Bitcoin and fortunately the one thing scammers struggle to replicate in a manner that they can profit on.\n\nBut you see all these attempts, how many alt currencies do we have already? How many of them are created for malicious reasons? A lot, but ofcourse some have potentials but then outside of Bitcoins realm, by actually solving a problem and setting itself up to create its own space.\n\nPaycoin however, is hugely centralized, so much so that is should be renamed "paygaw", not only that but its whole momentum was built on the promise of VC investors and a "get rich quick scheme" etc.\n\nIt doesn\'t create its own space, nor solve any problems Bitcoin cant. Yet, it wants to directly compete and somehow get everyone who uses bitcoin to jump ship.\n\nWhy would anyone choose Paycoin over Bitcoin given the choice? \n\nI mentioned before many alt coins are made with malicious intent, no surprise there, on the contrary its almost strange there aren\'t more considering the fact that its so easy to create one, little risk in terms of investment, an exploding market, a surplus of miners looking for the next big thing and others who are desperate afraid to miss the next "Bitcoin train"\n\nAny logical person would expect to see various shady individuals backing and/or starting coins, creating marketing campaigns, building hype, promising the world if you just invest in their coin. Sadly it works, and it will continue to. People are just people.\n\nIn the end, you have to make a decision. Do you want to sit around and wait for what Joash Garzia says or does with his crypto currency? Hoping that everyone in Bitcoin decentralized-land joins the paygaw sekt and finally gives one company/man the reigns of internet money.\n\nCan you really visualize a future where everyone hails to the king Josh Garzia? and we all wishfully sit there and wait for a blogpost about what new feature paybase will implement in 2-3months?\n\nNo ofcourse not, what willl you do about it tho? Is today the day you make logical and decisions that are in your own best interest, or perhaps you wait a few days, just incase the paycoin value goes up?\n\nHow many do you think are in that "wait a little longer" boat atm? Noah would be in awe.\n\nMeanwhile Josh is making tons of cash, not only on a hefty paycoin holding he has been selling on top of that hype daily, but also on mining services, which mines "his coins"..\n\nIts almost impressive, what the paycoin lacks in real innovation he compasated with taking scamming to a whole new level.\n\nOnly question now is, can it be topped? It would be hard, but never doubt greed, within the end of 2015 we will probably see a premined coin, given out by a mining company pretending it was mined, while it mines Btc and pumbs its own coin with returns, while building hype for a 4-7months long con.\n\nIn the end though, all scam currencies live of one thing, hype. The day someone actually figures out something of value that can live side by side with Bitcoin you probably wont hear about it until everyone else does.\n\nAnd another note worth considering, if you invest into something solely on someones word and they fail to deliver on the first opportunity they have, Its probably safe to say it wont work out. especially in a market riddles with scams and get rich schemes. And, when that does happen and everyone sits there with something that actually cant be used for anything, and its dwindling in value while the invention of the millenium (Btc) is there looking directly at you, perhaps you should reconsider your path.\n\nOr just stick it out and wait, perhaps paycoin will be super huge next week.': 24, "The only innovations to PayCoin he's been able to make have all involved new ways to give him money.

It involves storing a wallet in a secured place that is not connected to the network. When done properly, it can offer a very good protection against computer vulnerabilities. Using an offline wallet in conjunction with backups and encryption is also a good practice. Here is an overview of some approaches.\n\nOffline transaction signing\nThis approach involves having two computers sharing some parts of the same wallet. The first one must be disconnected from any network. It is the only one that holds the entire wallet and is able to sign transactions. The second computer is connected to the network and only have a watching wallet that can only create unsigned transactions. This way, you can securely issue new transactions with the following steps.\n\n    Create a new transaction on the online computer and save it on an USB key.\n    Sign the transaction with the offline computer.\n    Send the signed transaction with the online computer.\n\nBecause the computer that is connected to the network cannot sign transactions, it cannot be used to withdraw any funds if it is compromised. Armory can be used to do offline transaction signature.\n============================\n\nSo my aim is to have all my bitcoins in cold storage (Raspberry Pi), and use other computer/android hot wallet to pay/get paid.\n5. I also need to see my balance, keep track of things, somewhere safe, like on my RPi?\n6. And this my other wallet, hot one, I can have more (computer/android)?\n\n\n@Aussiehash\nArch, and if OS update is not an option most likely gentoo (once compiled, i think i can clone SD card?).\nI am doing all this for SAFETY, so OS should be simply build with apps you need. The right OS is surely importaint, so pre-prepared distros are not an option, they are just full of apps I do not care for, or know of.\nI understand that Raspberry Pi will never be online... but I will have to stick a usb stick in it sometimes, to transfer coins?\nAnd in the future, when I get comfotable with this bitcoin thing, and realize futility of RPi\'s OS, I might change it and try something else.\n\n@394 (ooo, very nice looking card), right man,  I will remember you for clarifying this paper thing to me, and I\'ll read that github essey after I reply here.\n\n@mrmishmashmix, 1 ok, thank you, that is what i needed, 2 How do I keep track of my bitcoins? 3 "wallet generation seed", is that the node thing or feature of wallet?': 1, '1.

There are websites that you can save to a USB that will allow you to generate the keys necessary for your wallet. The file size at most would be a few hundred megabytes. I apologize but I can't think of the websites I've used before.\n\nAs for the Raspberry Pi, install your OS. Connect the USB that has the webpage on it. Open the webpage, then create your wallet. Creating a wallet is really just creating a very large random number. The webpage may have you move your cursor on the screen in a random way, you are giving it entropy that will be used to generate your keys (basically just trying to guarantee the randomness of the private key).\n\nLastly you can keep the keys on the Raspberry Pi, but you would never want to connect the Raspberry Pi to the Internet again, or you can write the keys down on a piece a paper.\n\nJust remember, that the numbers you are writing down is the only way you will be able to unlock the funds.

I will respond to you within a day\'s time, I am checking the different fora (bitcointalk, reddit, here, etc.) So definitely feel free!\n\nMy (admittedly very basic) platform is:\n\nChoice for the users. Anything that does not provide or preserve user choice is a non-starter.\n\nBitcoin development.\n\nPrivacy and anonymity development using bitcoin. (I acknowledge that privacy and anonymity are two very different things, and I support the idea that the use of technologies that offer either should be a choice for end users ~ and I understand that the technical and development details of this cannot be whisked away by legislators, but that the details and the interface of technological progress and cultural progress must be honored as part of how our digital expression is evolving.) Support for open source initiatives that accomplish, or can help accomplish this goal in bitcoin and in any distributed-digital currency that is supported or funded by the Board and is determined to be within the ambit of the Corporation\'s purpose.\n\nAdditional details about what I support:\n\nListening to the users, as well as recognizing and including member and non-member input in the context of the Board\'s deliberations and decisions. Enhancing communication and supporting education about bitcoin. Greater transparency about what the Foundation is doing, through timely presentation of agendas before meetings and posting of minutes promptly thereafter. No-one should have to wait weeks or months to know what the Board does. No censorship here... We came to bitcoin tired of financial censorship in the regulated marketplaces. Now we are experiencing censorship in bitcoin communities, in fora, in "services." Listening and support yes, censorship and exclusion no.\n\nDecentralization, support for the Foundation in its present configuration as a recognized nonprofit, and support for proposals that would decentralize aspects of the Foundation, including support for use and development of systems that would enable the userbase to collectively make funding decisions (to complement Board votes and decisions relating to funding). Independence from regulatory efforts. Focusing on expanding support for solutions based in technology (bitcoin development, decentralized exchanges, anonymity solutions).\n\nInitiatives that reduce possible coercion while preserving or enhancing the users\' ability to voluntarily make decisions about their own resources. No-one should ever be coerced or forced to provide funds to any organization or effort that they do not support, regardless of whether or not an organization claims a basis in law for its extraction of resources from the users. Freedom to express ourselves as we wish across the blockchain.\n\nSince early November 2014 and coming out with this platform, I have stated that I will vote against any Foundation proposal that would result in initiation, continuance, or expansion of support for: a.) Foundation lobbying (to Washington, D.C. or in any country where such lobbying activity would be proposed to extend to), b.) proposals to regulate bitcoin users or their identities, and c.) any effort, whether or not its proponents claim a basis in law, where evidence suggests that Foundation support for such an effort would result in user choice being impaired or limited.

Each company has its own people in charge and the actions of one cannot really reflect on the others. And again, it is not yet time to rush out to "prove" anything as of yet. As I said, Bitstamp\'s priority should be to secure their assets, to secure their systems, and then to make good on their promise that refunds will be made. If they fail to do that in a timely manner then certainly, let\'s pursue them further.\n\n> in fact, if the pesky people wanting proof could shut up\n\nWhat "proof" do you want, exactly? What memo could Bitstamp release right now that would placate you? That they were robbed was obvious. Would you like to know precisely how? What would you then have? How would you benefit? I think what you want would be summed up neatly in what is commonly called an "After Action Report", not a "During Action Report".\n\n> Good to get an insight into why Bitstamp should be congratulated for being robbed.\n\nNobody is congratulating them for being robbed and nobody is happy about it happening. However do recognize that they were robbed - that their company and each employee\'s job is basically on a fragile bubble of existence right now and unless they all did the heist themselves, they definitely have skin in the game as well here.\n\n> You\'re basically saying there\'s nothing that can or should be done other than let these guys handle it.\n\nIn an immediate sense, this is supremely true.  What could the police do?  It would take lots of time to get most regular police up to speed on what bitcoins are and how they work.  Maybe a full-on cybercrime division would be more helpful but those resources are rather thin in reality. Financial regulators could swoop in but in general they operate best within frameworks established by regulations - regulations which Bitcoin does not have and which the community frequently fight against. \n\nSo who are you going to call to "fix" this right away - and I mean within hours or a couple days - who could do better than Bitstamp itself?\n\n> And I\'m not suggesting the exchange be closed down: that would be an extreme measure after all.\n\nIt would be.

Most banks (or other companies) try to hide that they have any security breaches at all.\n\n> What is the point of Bitcoin\'s decentralized nature if another exchange is holding people\'s money?\n\nIf people want to actively trade bitcoins in a marketplace where it is easy to do so, are you going to try to stop them?

A lot of the money *exists* as digital credit 'loans' from banks (backed by their cash reserves or total capital inc assets, as fractions of the amount credited), which must be paid back with interest on top; so, if sufficient new money is not created, this will lead to a contraction of the money supply until there literally is not enough money in circulation to actually pay back all the loans, no matter how much value is produced. In Bitcoin, money is created without debt, and without interest.\n\nThe way in which '**money** *is* debt', is just that it functions in place of social debt, it is not actually debt. It's like a metaphor really, it kind of substitutes for social debt.

So after today, I apparently have 3 wallets, 99 cents in bitcoin, a working knowledge of how it works, several places to purchase bitcoin (with credit card which is far easier for me), and a solid understanding. I saw the post on Coinbase wanting your credit history and saw how they want a photo of your state issued id and since I can't even talk to the guy let alone walk into a physical location, that makes me uneasy (you don't even need a SSN (an SSN?) to open a bank account...

In my opinion, this is one of the key, and insufficiently recognized, uses of tipping: it makes it possible for you and me to play with a little bit of bitcoin *without having to buy it first*. Which means: without having to decide which of these services are trustworthy, which you\'d want to give your SSN to, etc. I had been lurking around here for a while, being curious but not feeling comfortable with it, when someone offered free 100 bit tips to anyone who asked. My 100 bit tip -- all of three cents!!! -- was all it took to get me over the chicken and egg problem: it\'s hard to feel comfortable before you\'ve played around a bit, but you have to feel comfortable in order to get a little BTC to play around with in the first place. Or rather, you would, if it weren\'t for tipping.\n\nEvery so often, people here make posts about how silly tipping is. ("Giving someone a few cents: how insulting!" Etc.) I think they completely miss how important it was for me, and perhaps for you. In my case, the tininess of the tip didn\'t affect its usefulness at all; if anything, it made it easier for me to play with it without worrying. \n\nIn any case, again, welcome!': 1, "I'd still suggest Circle... low weekly amounts to start with, but instant and safe.

I'll start a bounty of 3,000 bits.": 12, '[deleted]': 0, 'did u try: https://web.archive.org/web/*//www.reddit.com\n\npost may have been deleted': 1, "This is the post... Quiet scary regarding recent events...\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI would specifically like to give an opinion on Bitstamp and the general discontent that has been building with the exchange for the last few months.\n\nThese are the reasons why I think it no longer makes any sense, based on risk, to be trading on Bitstamp.\n\nThe fact is, trading is about assessing risks and the likelihood of events playing out in a certain direction. The future is not fixed, but one can look at indicators now and make informed decisions about how to act.\n\nBitstamp has now lost it's no.1 position to Bitfinex. I find this odd because while Bitfinex is the better exchange, they are terrible at marketing. You only every hear of Bitstamp in the news. So how is it possible that all of a sudden (because it happen in the last 30 days), that Bitfinex is suddenly the go to place for big money? Nothing has changed at Bitfinex, they offer the no new services except for the bizarre and frankly stupid decision to add a shitcoin to their exchange (which doesn't appear is doing well by trade volume and is certainly not the reason for knocking Bitstamp out of poll position). \n\nThis my friends is the first overt indicator. The whales have moved from Bitstamp to Bitfinex. Make no mistake about it, whales talk to each other and whales get insider information, they moved for a reason unknown to the public.\n\nBitfinex used to place a large percentage of their orders onto Bitstamp's orderbook, in fact it accounted for up to 25% of Bitstamp's daily volume. Bitfinex used to publish the figures, so it's not speculation. So here comes indicator number two, Bitfinex no longer place much liquidity on their books. Why, because they don't need to. That is indicator number two which confirms and corroborates the first indicator.\n\nRight after MtGox's insolvency, Bitstamp did something curious. They issued a notice in March about their solvency, but they did so using an audit from November. This could suggest an attempt to divert attention from something because it makes no sense to use an audit that was 4 months old to claim solvency today. This is the next indicator. [Game theory: What would you do if you were short of BTC especially at a time when the entire community was asking serious questions of all the exchanges? Better divert attention fast.]\n\nBitstamp were then caught with their pants down with a deceptive fee structure. They were sure to publish it in their rules, but few actually realised how evil it was. It is akin to how payday lenders hide their 2000% APR in the small print. \n\nThere is no reason for an honest company to do this. Fees are subject to rounding per trade. This means if you place 1BTC up to sell and it gets nibbled away in 0.01BTC chunks, your fees would be rounded up to the nearest cent making the fee orders of magnitude higher than you would pay if you paid the fee without rounding. No other exchange does this. It became such a furore that eventually Bitstamp responded by making the minimum trade $5 so it wouldn't be so bad. \n\nWhy would a profitable, popular exchange need to scalp people like this. So this be the next indicator and the fee rounding is in itself enough to make any serious trader consider a different exchange.\n\nRecently, Bitfinex have begun to distance themselves from Bitstamp. Could be a matter of trying to separate out the brand, but the timing is strange to me. http://www.cryptocoinsnews.com/news/bitcoin-trading-platform-bitfinex-distancing-bitstamp/2014/06/12\n\nNext comes Bitstamp's AML/KYC procedures. It has been widely noted in the community that Bitstamp has been exerting unreasonable AMY/KYC on customers, including already verified customers. This was a trick used by MtGox. Since obviously there are people trading in stolen bitcoins etc., an exchange can easily confiscate bitcoins and USD from people by asking them extra hard KYC. The criminals are not going to comply and the exchange gets an easy excuse to seize funds. MtGox collected 80,000BTC this way if you remember. Ask yourself now, is stamp doing the same thing [to recoup a loss?].\n\nNo other exchange anywhere behaves like this. This is the next indicator. \n\nThe recent proof of solvency by Bitcoin Core Developer Mike Hearn is my next complaint. I believe Mike went into the audit with a presupposition that Bitstamp is all above board, so he simply failed to make any reasonable steps to verify anything properly. His process was simply to run a MySQL SUM() on what he was told was the live Bitstamp database to get a balance of BTC across all accounts, and then compare that with the cold storage wallet [the address of which was not published for us to see].\n\nMike Hearn should know better than this, and I am shocked he could be so cavalier. Anyone in a similar position should think very carefully about the influence their reputation can exert. It is entirely possible he is an unwitting party to another deception. In any case, his 'audit' is not worth the paper it is written on because he made no effort to determine if the database he was looking at was the real one (e.g. place an order on Bitstamp for an odd amount and run a SQL query to find it for example). There was no attempt to audit the integrity of the database \xe2\x80\x93 records could have been removed or altered for the purposes of the audit.\n\nThere was no simultaneous audit of the USD balance, so if there was a shortfall there, it could be seen: if there was a shortfall in BTC, USD could be used to temporarily buy back coins for the purpose of the audit, or even borrowed. In short, the audit was a complete farce and proves nothing. This is the next indicator. If I were running an exchange and I really wanted to prove the exchange was solvent, I would do it properly \xe2\x80\x93 it doesn't cost much for a couple of real accountants for a day... It just seems like a knee-jerk reaction to a lot of heat they were taking on r/bitcoin.\n\nOver the last week we have seen an unreasonable discount appear at Bitstamp. A discount is when the price is cheaper at one exchange than another. A discount or premium (the opposite) can only appear when there is arbitrage friction. That means the inability to move funds between exchanges in order to trade the spread and make a profit (eventually evening out the differences). Arbitrage is the reason most exchanges remain at relatively the same price. \n\nWe saw a spread indicator with MtGox too, twice. Once when it was a premium (caused by their 'banking troubles') and again when it became a discount, cause by their BTC insolvency.\n\nBTC-e for example always trades at a discount because there is a certain amount of friction moving fiat, and it is more expensive to do so there. Historically this is how it's always been. When an exchange deviates from the norm, then you have look at why (these are ninja trading indicators).\n\nThe norm was, Bitstamp and Bitfinex traded more or less at the same rates, with Bitfinex being a little higher at times. Recently, Bitstamp has been trading at up to $20 less than Bitfinex and even lower than BTC-e at times. There has to be a reason for this. Since Bitstamp is a white exchange with good banking connections, there is simply no reason for this to occur, so it means clearly, something has changed. There could be a perfectly reasonable explanation, but it is likely pointing to some form of distress.\n\nLastly, redditors have begun to complain of delays in BTC withdrawals. This is exactly how it started at MtGox (signs began in September/October 2013 on and off). Small amounts were going through instantly, large amounts were getting stuck. Obviously delays can happen when hot wallets are depleted, but again, there has to be a reason for a deviation from the norm. Deviation plays a big part in risk analysis.\n\nSo, I leave this report with a lot of questions. I cannot say what is wrong, if anything, at Bitstamp because I just don't know. But the signs are not good. On the balance of probabilities, it looks highly risky.\n\nWhen the signs are not good like this, you would be a fool to keep on risking your funds at Bitstamp. Like many people, I had a lot of loyalty to MtGox, but the final straw came for me in October 2013 when I also experienced major BTC withdrawal issues. That was a major red flag to me, since barring time to refill a hot wallet, there is no reason for long delays. Bitcoin is supposed to be frictionless. I warned everyone about it and was shouted down repeatedly. I left MtGox, and 4 months later MtGox took $450 million USD down in flames.\n\nI implore you all, don't get 'stamped' like you got 'goxxed'. The fact is, Bitstamp is not running a tight ship, and they are not offering the level of service they should be. On that basis alone, you should be using a different exchange.\n\nI've not talked about Bitfinex since this isn't a sales pitch for them. I've not talked about how they offer leveraged margin trade as well as normal exchange. Nor have I talked about the p2p lending platform where people who don't want to trade can earn swap interest on USD or BTC balance. I've also not mentioned the 5 order types they have: limit, market, stop, trailing stop, fill or kill; nor about the OCO orders or hidden orders. Bitfinex is truly way ahead of the curve.\n\nSo please, for the love of all that is good, do not take unnecessary risks with your money. For me, Bitstamp is rotten until they prove themselves otherwise. It would be easy for them to prove themselves, and if I was running the exchange I would have pulled my finger out and got it done a long time ago as a priority with full transparency, all the way. \n\nIf it turns out Bitstamp is rotten, don't come crying to me if you failed to heed my advice. If I am wrong, then I am wrong. But frankly I am not taking any risks being so bold because I have raised a set of reasonable questions that remain unanswered and I cannot remain quiet about what looks like yet another scandal in the making.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n": 10, "I don't think so.

There isn\'t a substantial unradicalized undercurrent of revolution-seeking individualists out there. Libertarianism is a fringe philosophy, classical liberalism is too big to be fringe, but far away from a substantial position almost anywhere in the developed world except maybe the United States, where it\'s entwined with various other political positions in a stagnant two party system.

They\'re okay, and this isn\'t because all of these people are sheep, it\'s because life in this developed world, even if there are certain things that we might not *like*, generally **is** pretty okay.

Life would be pretty difficult if there were no things. That said, some of them are good, and some of them are bad. \n\nI don\'t think we can or should try to do without regulations. To those total libertarians out there: the government regulates what counts as private property. This seems unnecessary as long as you\'re thinking about things like your coat or your car. But what if you own land that a stream flows through, a stream that you and others who live on it use to irrigate your land? Could someone upstream from you just decide to divert *all* the water, on the grounds that once it flowed onto his land, it was his? If not, how much could they divert? \n\nLikewise, think of intellectual property. We don\'t think of a lot of innovations as intellectual property, even though some of them are highly cherished by the people who came up with them. (Think of fashions in clothing, especially among teenagers.) Which ones should we be able to patent or copyright, and for how long? \n\nOr think of traffic laws. I\'ve always wondered how libertarians deal with this. If freedom means not being interfered with, especially by the state, then traffic laws are one big giant loss of freedom, and one that we encounter all the time. But if freedom means being able to get where you want to go and arriving in one piece, without anyone having the right to tell you what your destination should be, then traffic laws (driving on one side of the road, stop signs and red lights, etc.) are a net gain for freedom. Most libertarians I know have a hard time getting exercised over traffic lights. But I think this is odd, since (as far as I can tell) the same logic that justifies traffic lights justifies the Affordable Care Act as well. (I\'m fine with this, being a liberal. But my libertarian friends are not. I\'ve never seen what the difference is supposed to be.)\n\nA good set of traffic laws is good for everyone. A bad set (lights red for all parties 9/10 of the time, speed limit of 1 mph, the side of the street you can drive on changing from minute to minute) would be terrible. A good intellectual property system is good for everyone, since it rewards innovation. A bad system (vague patents that last forever, the right to copyright words like "the", what have you) would be terrible. \n\nThis is why it\'s good to be wonky, rather than reflexive, in ones political opinions: to know who actually cares about writing good regulations rather than bad ones, and to vote for them.

First of all, the number is considerably less than 2^64 \xe2\x80\x93 1, the largest integer that can be stored in a standard integer on a computer \xe2\x80\x93 go above that, and the integers wrap around to zero like an odometer.\n\n>Second, however, there is another, lower threshold that the total satoshi count manages to fall just below: the largest possible integer that can be exactly represented in floating point format. Integers are not the only kind of number that computers can store; to handle decimal numbers, computers use a format known as floating point representation. Floating point representation is essentially a binary version of scientific notation. For example, here are some values that you may be familiar with if you studied any physics:\n\n>Mass of the Earth: 5.972 * 10^24 kg\n\n>Mass of the Sun: 1.989 * 10^30 kg\n\n>Speed of light: 2.998 * 10^8 m/s\n\n>One lightyear: 9.460 * 10^15 m\n\n>Mass of a proton: 1.672 * 10^-27 kg\n\n>Planck length: 1.616 * 10^-35 m\n\n>Notice how scientific notation allows you to express all of these values with reasonable accuracy despite their wildly varying scales. Floating point notation is essentially scientific notation in binary; when you store the number 9.625, your computer stores \xe2\x80\x9c1.001101 * 10^11\xe2\x80\x9d (or rather, it stores 01000000 00100011 01000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000, which is the same thing in high-precision serialized form). In this high-precision form, the \xe2\x80\x9csignificand\xe2\x80\x9d (the part that\xe2\x80\x99s not the exponent) has 52 bits. What this means is that high-precision (more precisely, \xe2\x80\x9cdouble precision\xe2\x80\x9d) floating point numbers are good enough to exactly store integers up to 2^53, but not higher \xe2\x80\x93 if you go higher, you start lopping off digits at the end.

The reason being, is that now developers and sysadmins are going to have to think outside the box.  They'll have to become a bit more paranoid because the stakes are so much higher.  Things that used to be taken for granted are now going to become real issues.\n\nFor example, who'd have thought that USB drives could infect a computer by just plugging them into your computer (e.g. not an auto run, but at the driver level...), or how one researcher found that stock hardware transmitted a virus via ultra sound (one computer sitting next to another without even an Ethernet cable).  Snowden exposed the NSA hacks where they intercepted hardware and replaced the Ethernet ports with ones that intercepted and transmitted data via RF to receiving devices.  Before the advent of LCD, CRT's were vulnerable to people watching in another room with a specialized device that picked up the radiation the CRT was emitting.  Imagine if modern video cards were equipped with a backdoor to transmit a low power TV like signal that could pick up what is being displayed.  \n\nAll this will have to be addressed for Bitcoin to be accepted on a large scale.
