" and "Electrum\'s key stretching is not intended to protect the seed against someone having an encrypted seed and bruteforcing AES.

And that's taking into account all the computing power on earth and all the computing power that will be created any time soon, and assuming Moore's Law.\n\nSo that twelve word seed is pretty safe.  Some of the super paranoid of people use a 24 word seed (not currently offered by electrum, although it may be when 2.0 comes out), and 24 words truly is overkill.  To put that in perspective, a 24 word seed has about the same number of combinations as there are atoms in the universe (aka an 80 digit number).

It doesn't make sense to modify those words because then they aren't valid digits and don't decode to numbers.\n\nElectrum seeds are 128 bits.  If you were to encode that using all printable characters on your keyboard (say, 52 letters + 10 digits + 10 symbols) then it would be log72(2^128) = 20 characters long.

But as long as the protocol stays the same and as long as there is no efficient distributed pool such that miners get frequent reward based on their mining power brought to the Bitcoin-network, exactly those distributed mini miners are surely devoting their power to a centralized pool. That means, we have solved nothing. I think we need to really find a solution, maybe in the protocol itself that miners directly get as much Bitcoins as they have share in mining power - that would be a solution that would benefit from more decentralization caused by economy of scale. But until we have not solved this issue, nothing would change, since the economic incentive is to strong to work for a centralized pool.': 1, 'As a first goal for mining, I would say that if someone invests in mining hardware, this person should have full control over the blocks mined with this hardware. A lot of miners give away exactly this kind of distributed power to a pool operator.': 1, "I got to thinking this is OK.  Pools can't win that much by a 51% attack, or whatever, and they have much more to lose by damaging bitcoin - which is their revenue.  They don't even want to look like they could damage it, as that might be enough to reduce the price and their revenue.  \n\nSo you'd expect, particularly as the participants are free moving (fundamentally decentralised), they would naturally settle at some level of organisation that trades off the efficiency of large pool size with the risks of being too big.  I gather that is pretty much what we observe?\n\nIt is still possible, it seems to me, that pool operators could short bitcoin and then subvert their pool to deliberately damage bitcoin and drive down the price.  But as long as the damage was only superficial, any price fall would quickly be cancelled out.  Once the market realised this, it would take away the incentive for doing it again.\n\nThat would leave the possibility of shorting and then seriously damaging bitcoin, so it's future utility was threatened.

Maybe e.g. in quantum computer research or acquisition of mining hardware. Basically, with Bitcoin all trust comes down to the non-invertibility of the SHA256 hash function. I trust this function since it is used in many other crypto-applications as well and a broken SHA256 would have much more impact than only on Bitcoin. But with the pool problem the trust remains on the good behavior of miners which is nothing that I would trust.

An obvious goal, which is better for the whole community including the miners, would be if each miner always obtain a reward based on its mining contribution to the network.

But if we came up with an efficient competitive distributed (and thus no-trust requiring) pool miners would definitely prefer that.\nA thought btw.: If we had an absolutely no-trust requiring distributed pool that is not competitive it could still solve the problem if most of the miners would devote their hash-power to that pool. Why? because such a pool could perform selfish mining in a positive way.\n\nPlease, before you start shouting. Just think a little about my thought. This would not require a change in the protocol and it does not depend on the efficiency of this distributed pool. If this pool takes over most of the mining power it has the potential to receive all rewards by performing positive selfish mining. All other miners outside that pool also need to change, otherwise they would have no chance of earning anything.

If you would like to hear a number, I'm sorry, I can't give you that. But I basically think we should distribute everything as much as possible to obtain the biggest amount of trust, namely by having the lowest trust-requirement.\n\nAnd to define the problem (again): The hash-power-ownership is much more distributed compared to the distribution of the ones having control over huge amounts of this hash-power (centralized pools). A fundamental cause for this problem is the economic incentive of miners to mine for a centralized pool rather than a distributed pool or even alone. And even though currently there seems to be no pool powerful enough to cause any harm to the network, the risk is still much larger compared to a more distributed solution. And furthermore, the chance is much higher that a few powerful entities are attacked and controlled compared to many entities with little power.\n\nAdditionally, with centralized pools, how do I know that pool operators do not already work together? I cannot know.
