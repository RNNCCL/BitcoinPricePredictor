There is zero downside I can think of to updating a warrant canary regularly to keep people aware of the project\'s current status.\n> If you\'ve been given a warrant and told not to update the canary, how would a user be able to tell the difference between a negligent dev and legitimately rooted software?\n\nYes, I found it kind of silly that he linked to his own comment in our thread about his authority in canary warrants, when my reply was upvoted and his downvoted.\n\nRegardless, I understand reddit may not be the decider of all knowledge, but there is some common sense and logic at play here.\n\nHere are a few issues that /u/itistoday needs to address -\n\nFirst,\n\n*Why* is it a bad/unsustainable idea? \n\nUsing the logic that you "may forget your keys" is a illogical stance. Keys can be backed up with redundancy, and if you are a developer of software that will hold millions of dollars of peoples money, surely you can give a friend a usb/cd with your pgp private key to hold onto incase your ~~cat~~ dog decides to eat your pgp key?\n\nBut aside from that, lets discuss the legal aspect of it.\n\nFirst, a court issued order comes with threat of violence. Thugs with guns and badges will come to your house, beat you down to the floor and throw you in a cold concrete and metal cell to rot if you disobey the order.\n\nSo let us evaluate the *possible* orders that could be issued,\n\n- Court order to keep updating your canary warrant  \n- Court order to gag/silence you from speaking out that you are under legal scrutiny, or worse, fully compromised by a legal authority who may be using your software as a honey pot.  \n- Court order to provide your keys for your canary  \n\nYou *must* comply with all of these actions or face violence/jail. All three scenarios can be reconciled by having a 3rd party update your canary for you. You can create a login to your site (Maybe add ssl ...lol <:/)for your canary pgp key wielding friend, who updates it for you through a anonymizer so that his security may not be threatened. You can also subscribe to a canary watch, which is devoted to this specific cause. You can also have said friend with key provide regular signed canary messages to the canary watch provider. \n\nDisclose this information, signed with your key, on your site, and disclose you are not in possession of the keys and have no way of stopping the canary updates. Since the court order is not for your friend your friend can legally update it on your behalf. The entire purpose of this is so that you are not ever in contempt of court for disobeying a court order.\n\nYou cannot give what you do not have and you cannot update what you cannot sign.\n\nYou and /u/SamouraiWalletDev and anyone else can read this and see the logic in it. There is a reason these canary watch sites exist, and there is a reason you periodically update.\n\nThe common sense question of "How will I know if you are compromised if you do not provide updates" is valid. He cannot answer that question of course, because if you only create one message one time, then there is no way to know that you are not compromised.\n\nThe reason is obvious - If a court orders you to specifically *not* update your canary, you *have* to comply or you face threat of violence/jail. Now, im sure everyone sitting behind their keyboard thinks they are a libretarian badass that will scream in the face of the law as its kicking down your doors, but let me tell you that most people are pissing themselves when the thugs come knocking. \n\nAnd when the reality of jail is in your face, who can say whether you have the balls to defy a court order? Unlikely, if you ask me and im sure most will agree.\n': 1, 'proGuard will stop a lot of people in there tracks too. It will decompile but be a massive pile of gibberish.

The off hand tweet someone posted here? I just want to make sure that we are looking at the same thing. \n\nThe findings here we aren\'t refuting, and never were hiding it either. From day one we have highlighted - mostly within our alpha group discussion group, but also there is a mention on our website - the need to move off third party API\'s - not only due to privacy concerns but also the increased downtime we were experiencing due to no fault of our own. Indeed, this is part of the reason we are not publicly available in the Google Play store today instead behind an "opt-in" testing path.\n\n> I think this is unethical. Good privacy is very hard.

If any of our testers feel that we have been unethical in our practises I would like to sincerely apologise and work to rectify that. \n\n> You said the other day that if you were co-opted by interests that wanted to harm users, people would notice in your behavior, and stop trusting the wallet.\n\nI believe that was in the context of requiring KYC/AML, but yes overall the point stands.\n\n> Is this true? Lets see: You released a closed source wallet, that phones a third party API and reveals private user data. You did not disclose that it did this. What are we to conclude from that?\n\nYes a closed source alpha testing wallet. Yes it relies on a third party API (in the build being discussed BC.i is the sole API source, in an upcoming build we separate address balances from transaction pushing). I wasn\'t aware I needed to disclose this piece of technical information on a reddit thread about a tweet I made regarding KYC/AML in Bitcoin.

Thank you. \n\n> What good does it serve anyone how much you\'ll wax philosophic about "going to jail"-- when the rubber meets the road it seems you are already showing that you won\'t do the right thing.

You provide the keys to a unknown/unpublicized 3rd party (friend) to update the canary for you on the condition that so long as you contact him regularly and tell him to do so, he will update it for you. You do not have the keys, he does. You cannot force him to update the canary if present conditions are not met and neither can the court without knowing who he is. Thats kind of the point and you ignored that conveniently. You create conditions ahead of time such as having two email accounts you send the update to. You must send the email to both accounts for it to be updated and if one mail is missing then it should not be updated.\n\nThen, if you *are* forced by the court to contact your 3rd party to update it, you comply with the order and send the email to have it updated to only one account. Either way, since your friend is not known and not under court order, he will not update since the conditions are not met. You can say with full legal compliance that you did as asked and cannot be held in contempt of court as you can provide evidence. His email can be anonymous, they cannot comply a non-treaty zone email provider to comply with a US warrant.\n\nEither way, this is all a aside.

In that context, it becomes more clear that false positive rate is directly correlated with privacy/non-linkability and perfect privacy could only ever occur with 100% false positive rate, while perfect delivery accuracy could only ever occur with perfect linkability. The rest is essentially a trade-off.\n\nGiven that bloom filter linkability would only ever increase with subsequent message delivery, if you want it to provide privacy, you have to recycle the bloom filter after a certain number of deliveries and perpetually keep the false positive ratio high at the cost of bogus delivery.\n\nNot only that, but if there\'s any kind of ACK subsequent to receipt, you have to make sure that happens completely independent of processing the message or you torpedo privacy via timing attack.

Good privacy is very hard. But even more important that the best privacy is being utterly honest and frank about the limitations. Phoning home to bc.i API and leaking the user\'s private information isn\'t just some mistake, it\'s a major functional design decision. \n\nYou said the other day that if you were co-opted by interests that wanted to harm users, people would notice in your behavior, and stop trusting the wallet.\n\nIs this true?  Lets see: You released a closed source wallet, that phones a third party API and reveals private user data. You did not disclose that it did this.  What are we to conclude from that?\n\nI think this is indistinguishable from what would happen if the wallet were co-opted... and the fact that your response here is to attack back and make excuses rather than acknowledging a serious breach in privacy and communication does not bode well for the future prospects of this wallet as a pro-privacy tool.\n\nWhat good does it serve anyone how much you\'ll wax philosophic about "going to jail"-- when the rubber meets the road it seems you are already showing that you won\'t do the right thing, even when the stakes are much lower.

It takes an equal number of confirms to open a payment channel securely as it takes to get security on a regular bitcoin transaction. Equally to close the channel and finalise the payment takes an equal number of confirms and is just as susceptible to network forks as any regular bitcoin transaction.\n\nAt best you can say that lightning is  'instant' only because you have prepaid with an incorrect amount and waited the correct amount of confirms for your prepayment to clear. Only difference is now you need to be given your change in the final transaction, which still requires that you wait the recommended amount of confirms before you consider it safe from forks.": 0, "It doesn't need to be demonstrated, we have logic. What you're saying is that every full node can/will be able to validate all of the world's transactions during a 10 minute interval. Let's disregard that the time to verify a block should be extremely quick, otherwise miners would spend the whole 10 minute interval verifying before they can _safely_ decide to extend that block. But whatever, we'll use 10 minutes as an relaxed upper bound. \n\nAt some point we will hit a limit to verifying transactions. If you want the network to handle 2000/s, you also have to validate at least at that speed.  2000/s is achievable on moderately powerful desktops (and secp256k1 improvements help), but taking 10 minutes to verify a block erodes the security properties from the underlying consensus protocol. The security of the Bitcoin protocol [drops dramatically](https://eprint.iacr.org/2014/765.pdf) as block propagation + block verification time approaches the block interval. This also doesn't take into account network spikes, but let's do a little more math to arrive at something more conclusive. \n\nTechnically, verification it has to be done even faster because of block propagation, which we'll say is 15s for 1MB on [average](http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/49318d3f56c1d525aabf7fda78b23fc0/P2P2013_041.pdf), which is conservative given the sustained growth in block size.\n\nTo handle 2000/s, we'd need 2000 txns/s * 600 s/block =1,200,000 txns/block. At [600 bytes/txn](https://tradeblock.com/blog/analysis-of-bitcoin-transaction-size-trends), the block size would have to be 720MB. Propagation scales linearly with block size, so propagating a block now takes 15 s/MB * 720 MB = 3 hours. I'll even ignore the storage requirements for storing that every 10 minutes...\n\nEither way, we need a way to reduce these figures so that they take a small amount of time compared to the block interval. Let's shoot for 30 seconds, 15s for propagation and 15s for validation. \n\nFor block propagation alone, we'd need a 720x improvement, and this needs to adopted by a significant majority of the network. This just doesn't seem possible in the time frame we all have for Bitcoin.\n\nFurthermore, trying to verify all those transactions in 15s means a 40x improvement in verification; again this just isn't reasonable in our time frame if we're looking for a scalability now. \n\nNone of this accounts for peak traffic or myriad of other concerns. But these numbers demonstrate the inefficiencies of forcing _all_ nodes to validate _all_ transactions, which is inherent to the original design outlined in the paper. If you don't care about centralization, then sure Bitcoin scales; cough cough, Mike Hearn and R3 are building this. \n\nThis is why the Lightning network is so critical to the scalability roadmap. We can get a nearly infinite number of transactions since the majority of them will never hit the blockchain. \n\nEssentially, LN locks funds between any two given parties. Once that happens, the network doesn't care about their intermediate transactions, since they have no effect on anyone else. Nodes only have to validate one more transaction when the channel is closed, since these funds are released and can now be sent to any party. \n\nIrregardless of whether blockchains can actually scale, which they don't, decentralization is what makes Bitcoin special. LN gives us nearly instant transactions and less burden on full nodes. It's a win win for safely maintaining decentralization while providing better scalability and usability. ": 3, "What are you implying when you say it isn't bitcoin?\n\nThe units are bitcoin, the transaction format is Bitcoin.\n\nThey bitcoin are not actually transferred until you broadcast the transaction. Perhaps that's what you mean?\n\nBy your definition, Coinbase, Circle, and any custodial handling of bitcoin units is not bitcoin.\n\nBy your definition, LN is more bitcoin than custodial handling, because you have a guaranteed ability to transact on the Bitcoin network.": 1, "I think of there being two ways to approach scalability. \n\nThe first way is to create a monolith, to make a super beefed up, super fast computer that can handle what you throw at it. \n\nThis is often the simple and easy way to scale, however it has drawbacks: after a while you can't really buy a beefier computer and super top end computers are expensive.\n\nThe second way is to shard into pieces, many computers separated out and responsible for a fraction of the overall task.\n\nThis is usually the harder and more complicated way to scale, since projects generally don't start out this way and separating into parts makes coordination between the parts a new component. The benefit of this method is that you can always buy more computers, and a failure in one shard doesn't necessarily bring everything down\n\nI see Lightning as more of a sharding system for Bitcoin. Each client keeps his own state (the transactions) and nodes process and relay only their own neighborhood of transactions, not the entire networks'. This puts a firm limit on the computing resources required for an individual node.\n\nI'm not a believer that Lightning will necessarily win the scaling competition, but whatever does win will have to transform this problem into a sharding one like Lightning does. \n\nAny ideas where individual nodes can just have ever increasing workloads is not going to be able to compete with sharding ideas where the network becomes more diverse and demand on nodes remains constant. You could write a great search engine that ran on one super machine, but when you put it against Googles 1 million machines, no amount of upgrades to your server could match their combined power": 8, 'That sounds like a fair analogy.': 3, "LN doesn't prevent you from sending an ordinary Bitcoin transaction, so if you are unhappy with the who you're being routed through that's always an option. And they'll be relatively cheaper since the majority of transactions will never hit blockchain, so there'd likely be less demand per capita for block space. ": 1, 'I guess.

In this case, it appears that a 6 block invalid chain happened that penalized F2Pool more than $25,000 for failing to validate.\n\nSuch a large invalid chain can easily avoided in the future if miners would just start validating and mining at the same time. It seems likely to me that this is what they are all doing by now, as it is their best option.\n\n\nAlso note: validating nodes would not be fooled by these bad blocks at all. And SPV nodes (which already trust their data sources) could simply politely request that they only be sent data from validated blocks.\n\nSo there is really no unmanageable downside with SPV mining, as far as I can see. Maybe /u/petertodd can point out where I\'m wrong.\n\nAnd SPV mining makes it possible to start mining immediately, without waiting for the full transmission and validation. Which is a HUGE benefit.\n\nSegregated witness allows an even more attractive scenario.\n\n1. Miners start SPV mining an empty block the moment they receive a solved header.\n\n2.  Miners optionally use bloom filter magic to start including some transactions that they know aren\'t in the solved block.\n\n3. They receive the complete non-witness message, and they provisionally update their utxo set.\n\n4. Finally, they receive the segregated witness and validate the previous block to ensure that they are not mining a chain that will eventually be abandoned.\n\nThe change being proposed here, of requiring that the block demonstrate knowledge of the previous block contents, makes SPV mining impossible and requires the entire block to be communicated before work can begin.\n\nIt is imagined that miners will be forced to validate the previous block, but most miners will not be able to validate fast enough to be competitive.

Where are these made?\n\n-- Generally in America.\n\n-- There are more and more Bitcoin ATM\'s around the world. We can see them on the map. There are 555.\n\n-- 16 in Japan, huh?\n\n-- Yes, there are different brands too: Genesis ATM is the leading manufacturer of Bitcoin ATM\'s. Lamassu is #2. One\'s that are easy to use are becoming more common. We are adding one Bitcoin ATM per day on average right now around the world.\n\n-- Recently the price has been going up and down. But it seems more people are buying bitcoin these days; we can safely ignore the recent Hearn debacle.\n\n-- There was a seminar recently that we attended. How was it for you?\n\n-- I thought that it was easy to understand, and I thought it was noteworthy that transactions are almost free of fees\nand the fact that everyone in the network secures bitcoin together I thought was interesting. I also thought, wow, I\'ve never thought about the nature of money before either...\n\n-- A lot of people were buying bitcoins there, too, huh?\n\n-- Yeah, quite a few people.\n\n-- Some individuals were buying a large amount too.\n\n-- So let\'s talk about how people are getting their hands on bitcoin these days... If you buy bitcoin at an ATM you\'ll either send it to a wallet on your phone, or you\'ll get one of these paper wallets with the private key and the public key showing. Of course if you\'ve got a lot of money on your paper wallet, it\'s insecure, and you stand to lose it all if anyone scans the private key before you transfer the bitcoin associated with it away to some other wallet (and a new address).\n\n-- So how do you secure bitcoin? If you look at the top 100 richest bitcoin addresses on BitcoinRichList, it shows there are some with over $60 million worth of bitcoin in them. And notice the addresses here, there are a few that start with a 3, and most of the rest start with a number 1. The number at the beginning of the addresses tell you something. A 1 tells you that it\'s a normal single-signature wallet address. A 3 tells you that it belongs to a multi-signature wallet.\n\n-- Multi-signature wallets, such as the Trezor hardware wallet, or any number of multi-sig software wallets, allow you to divide the ownership or control over a bitcoin wallet amongst three or more keys. You can distribute these keys around the world, or have your neighbor or a friend hold a 3rd key for you while you hold 2. If you hold 2 keys, you can use those 2 keys to spend your bitcoin from the multi-sig wallet that you\'ve got. If you lose one, your neighbor can still help you sign off on the transaction so it can be sent.\n\n-- It\'s kind of like a bank, isn\'t it?\n\n-- It is like a bank except only the wallet (account) owner can move the bitcoin to a new address.\n\n-- Only about 30 out of the top 100 bitcoin addresses now is a multi-sig wallet address. It seems rather foolish. You\'re much more vulnerable keeping all your bitcoin in a single-signature wallet. I think we\'ll be seeing the number of multi-sig addresses increase a lot in the near future. We could expect more multi-sig addresses to be taking up the top 100 richest address spots in the next few years.\n\n-- There are some trends in top companies around the world (having to do with dematerializaiton). So many of the world\'s most innovative companies have little-to-no property or inventory; they generally just coordinate others\' resources:\n\n* Uber - The world\'s largest taxi company owns no vehicles.\n* Facebook - The world\'s most popular media owner creates no content.\n* Alibaba - The most valuable retailer has no inventory.\n* Airbnb - The world\'s largest accommodation provider owns no real estate.\n\n-- I could see bitcoin fitting into such a role the future: "Bitcoin - The world\'s largest bank holds no money".\n\n-- The Trezor is a really cool way to protect your bitcoins. If you don\'t plug it into your computer, you can\'t spend the bitcoins. If your computer is hacked, you\'re protected because the private key for your wallet is on the other device, the Trezor. Not only is the key separated from the network (offline), but you need to enter an pincode with on-screen obfuscated number pad, but also you need to confirm two times by pressing a button on the device before you can send money to someone.\n\n-- And now Trezor is selling this multi-sig set of hardware wallets. There\'s three in each package. You could take two and trust me to hold the third as a backup. You\'d need both of your keys, or one of yours plus mine, in order to withdraw from the account. I can\'t ever withdraw from the account because I only have one key.\n\n-- You can see this being potentially very useful for companies to secure large accounts. For example, they could distribute 15 keys to members of the board of directors. Maybe they give one to a law firm they hire to arbitrate in the case consensus cannot be reached or if, heaven forbid, more than half of the board members die or lose their keys. You can set the minimum number of keys needed to send a transaction to whatever you want: 5 of 15, 10 of 15, etc.\n\n-- There are new physical hardware wallets that work just like credit cards, too, now. They use the same kind of chip technology and everything. As of right now, there is no standard way of securing your bitcoin with hardware wallets. The bitcoin ecosystem is still in its infancy, but it is developing quickly.\n\n-- What do you think about all this?\n\n-- I feel like I want to know more now, like it would be good to know about bitcoin and how it works.\n\n-- What about the economic and technological impacts that this technology can have? What do you think about this?\n\n-- It seems like it could be useful for many things. Since you can send money to anyone it would be great for charity, wouldn\'t it?\n\n-- Yes, indeed. You can donate to any given cause around the world.\n\n-- Ultimately, it\'s really a young technology and is not very user-friendly yet. But the developers in the space are working at a frantic pace to build it out and make it better and easier to use.': 1}, ('UN Commission Calls On Caribbean to Become Digital Currency Hub', 16): {'Its interesting that the Carribbean was the center of world trade during the first phase of globalization in the 15th and 16th centuries as well.

Its practically the same as using blockchain.info wallet directly.': 2, "I wouldn't worry, as other comments have explained. ": 1, 'The Bitcoin Core DNSseed lookup only runs when your node can\'t get enough peers on start fast enough. For most users it does not usually run at all, except the first time the software is run.\n\nWhen it does run, it makes DNS requests rather than connections-- the result may well be returned by the cache in the upstream resolver (at your ISP) without ever contacting the origin sever, but if it isn\'t the server usually does not see your IP but the IP of a recursive resolver at your ISP.\n\nThis behavior is fully disclosed and can be disabled by setting dnsseed=0. If you disable it, it may take several minutes to get peers when your node starts the first time (or if the ones you\'re aware of go away while you\'ve been offline for a while)... but it will work, even on the first run, without it... due to the hardcoded list of nodes snapshotted before major releases (but many of them will be down, months later, so finding the network via them takes a long time.)\n\nIn no case does the dnsseed learn anything about your addresses or transactions. The dnsseed operators are also generally [prohibited](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/dnsseed-policy.md) from collecting the limited information they may be exposed to by virtue of running a dnsseed.\n\nIf you use Tor, which is the strongly recommend configuration if you care about any privacy at all, then the dnsseeds don\'t learn anything about you. If you do not use Tor your node will be broadcasting it\'s IP over the p2p network too _all_ bitcoin users in any case, so the "leaked" information would largely be information you broadcast yourself.\n\nRegarding pigeonholing: excluding a particular node type from the results would have little to no effect on Bitcoin Core clients, as they\'ll learn about those nodes from other clients. Confining a peer to a given subset would require compromising all the DNSseeds, not just one, and is only really a potential vulnerability on first-run because otherwise your node will already know of many others (and likely won\'t consult the DNSseeds at all). Beyond the technical protections here, dnsseed operators are generally prohibited by policy from engaging in the attacks you described.\n\nNow, compare that to wallets that directly connects and sends all your addresses and transactions to a service that has no limitation on what it can do with the information and a poor privacy track-record... and this single service could distort your view of the network (instead of needing a 6 of 6 compromise), and AFAIK has no published policy guidance to set expectations and prevent abuse.  Do you really think this is at all comparable?\n\nBitcoin Core takes considerable efforts to preserve the user\'s privacy, and I believe that objectively when configured correctly (e.g. using Tor) it can provide the best privacy currently available to Bitcoin users... but we do not advertise it as a privacy tool or make strong claims about its privacy as there are many limitations and known areas for improvement. \n': 12, "Some background:\n\nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#peer-discovery\n\nThe main difference is that Bitcoin Core is open source.

But what we now think of as "SPV nodes" lack these fraud proofs, instead trusting miners absolutely. (This redefinition was first made by Mike Hearn\'s BitcoinJ.) This is way less secure than Satoshi imagined, and the rise of these validation-less nodes is a major threat to Bitcoin as a whole (see [here](https://bitcoin.org/en/bitcoin-core/features/validation) and [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node#Economic_strength)).\n\nSatoshi might not have realized it, but it was previously impossible to do fraud proofs that cover all of the rules. But with SegWit, this will be possible, and I hope that fraud proofs are implemented soon after SegWit. Even if the number of full nodes was reduced by 90%, if all lightweight nodes became capable of processing fraud proofs, this\'d probably still be a net gain in security for Bitcoin as a whole as well as for each of its users.
