It is stored in "unspent transaction outputs" (UTXOs), where each output has a value and an address (well a script, actually, but that\'s another topic).\n\nA UTXO can be thought of like an envelope of cash, with the address on the front. A transaction takes one or more envelopes, proves that the person/people opening them control(s) the addresses, tears them open, and redistributes the cash to new envelopes.\n\nThe new envelopes can\'t hold more in total than the old envelopes that were destroyed, but they can hold less. Any cash that doesn\'t make it into an envelope is collected by the miner as the transaction fee.\n\nThat\'s why change addresses are so important. If I want to pay you 0.1 BTC, but all I have is an envelope holding 1.0 BTC then I have to create two new envelopes. One with the 0.1 BTC and your address on it, and one with one of my addresses for the other 0.9 BTC (minus the transaction fee). If I forget to include my change output in the transaction, then the miner will get the unclaimed 0.9 BTC as a big transaction fee. There have been a couple of people that have lost as much as 20 BTC that way. (They were creating transactions by hand, which is playing with fire. Wallets will automatically handle change for you, so you don\'t have to worry about it.)\n\nDouble spending is creating two transactions that spend the same output, regardless of how much the address may have in other outputs.\n\nLet\'s say I have an address that controls a total of 3 BTC in 3 UTXOs, with each UTXO holding 1 BTC. We\'ll call the UTXOs A, B, and C. If I create one transaction that spends A and sends the money to you, and another transaction that spends A and sends to someone else, then that is a double spend. Only one of those two transactions will be accepted. It doesn\'t matter that the same address controls other outputs that could cover the amount for both. The two transactions only authorize the spending of UTXO A. In order to spend UTXO B or C I would have to create a whole new transaction that spends one of those specifically.': 2}, ('Can I purchase a Money Order with bitcoin???', 0): {}, ('Your Toolkit for Bitcoin Education.

You have all experienced this, in what I call the Murray Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. (I refer to it by this name because I once discussed it with Murray Gell-Mann, and by dropping a famous name I imply greater importance to myself, and to the effect, than it would otherwise\nhave.)\n\n> Briefly stated, the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect works as follows. You open the newspaper to an article on some subject you know well. In Murray\xe2\x80\x99s case, physics. In mine, show business. You read the article and see the journalist has absolutely no understanding of either the facts or the issues. Often, the article is so wrong it actually presents the story backward\xe2\x80\x93reversing cause and effect. I call these the \xe2\x80\x9cwet streets cause rain\xe2\x80\x9d stories. Paper\xe2\x80\x99s full of them.\n\n> In any case, you read with exasperation or amusement the multiple errors in a story\xe2\x80\x93and then turn the page to national or international affairs, and read with renewed interest as if the rest of the newspaper was somehow more accurate about far-off Palestine than it was about the story you just read. You turn the page, and forget what you know.\n\n> That is the Gell-Mann Amnesia effect. I\xe2\x80\x99d point out it does not operate in other arenas of life. In ordinary life, if somebody consistently exaggerates or lies to you, you soon discount everything they say. In court, there is the legal doctrine of falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus, which means untruthful in one part, untruthful in all.\n\n> But when it comes to the media, we believe against evidence that it is probably worth our time to read other parts of the paper. When, in fact, it almost certainly isn\xe2\x80\x99t. The only possible explanation for our behavior is amnesia.': 25, '>But why does any of this matter?\n\nI didn\'t say it did.

I can get you an accurate count now if you\'d like.\n\n>mining computers start working on assembling the next block in an automated fashion (without manual intervention)\n\nThat\'s not what the quote says. I\'ll remind you:\n\n"as soon as one block gets completed, another is automatically generated"\n\nIt doesn\'t say "start working on" as you did. It said generated. The definition of generated is: *to bring into being*. It can take over an hour for a new block to be brought into being, which makes the statement "as soon as ... another block is automatically generated" incorrect. \n\nAlso, to be technical, miners start working on completely *invalid* blocks. They don\'t work on the successful block which will be added to the blockchain. Only one lucky miner does that (usually) at any given ten minute interval, and that miner only knows it once the correct combination hash is found. That miner works on invalid blocks first too. And even then the block must be broadcast and accepted by other miners and not get orphaned, which happens too. So, no, another blockchain block isn\'t automatically generated as soon as a prior block is found.\n\nAnything else?': 1, "That's how the CEO ordered it!

Hobbyists can and do [build their own](http://cdn.instructables.com/FPK/PB8U/GZ0JIFCR/FPKPB8UGZ0JIFCR.MEDIUM.jpg) such machines.\n\n* A group of people bootstrap a "community machine shop" starting with hobbyist-level machines, but constantly upgrading to bigger and better ones.  These are automated machines, driven by software files.  Once you have enough machine tools, you make different machines, like a [sawmill](http://www.oakstump.com/personal/projects/sawmill/MVC003X.jpg), or (concrete block press).  With those, you can make parts for a house.  You can also machine parts for an engine and axles.  From those you can build a [tractor and attachments](http://s018.radikal.ru/i526/1304/58/6066f9a70753.jpg).  Then you can grow food.\n\n* With food and housing taken care of, the community machine shop has grown into a mini-economy.  You keep building out your capabilities with more machines, and put more displaced people to work for themselves, making what they need.\n\n* Where bitcoin comes into this is *not all the machines have to be in the same place*.  If they are networked, the whole network can collaborate on the next machine, and ownership of the machines can be distributed.  So when you need something made, you send out the parts files across the network, the parts get made, and eventually sent to you to assemble.  You pay for this with bitcoin, which you acquire by making other things for people in trade.\n\n\n\n* By trading, each person can specialize in things they like to do or are good at.

The world is going to continue like it is now for a good long while: statist, centralized, ignorant, high time-preference.

And as the protocol exists right now; and with much higher demand and volume; it is not usable as much more than a settlement layer.

Bitcoin admittedly won\'t be much use to you if that occurs, but I\'m not sure physical gold will be all *that* much more useful.

You can\'t send digital fiat without trusting an intermediary (a bank, PayPal, Western Union, etc.) to properly effectuate the transfer and you can\'t store fiat (digital or physical) without trusting the central bank not to destroy its purchasing power through money printing.  I was thinking more in terms of "systemic risk."  With Bitcoin, that\'s the risk that, e.g., the crypography underlying it breaks suddenly in a manner that makes it impossible to preserve the ledger.

This is genuinely revolutionary.\n\nIt also vindicates Satoshi\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on the generality of the Bitcoin scripting system.  And though it\xe2\x80\x99s long been suggested that bitcoin would become a clearing system on which genuine microtransactions would be layered, it was unclear that we were so close to having such a system in bitcoin already.\n\nNote that the scheme requires some solution to malleability to allow chains of transactions to be built (this is a common theme, so likely to be mitigated in a future soft fork), but Gregory Maxwell points out that it also wants selective malleability, so transactions can be replaced without invalidating the HTLCs which are spending their outputs.  Thus it proposes new signature flags, which will require active debate, analysis and another soft fork.\n\nThere is much more to discover in the paper itself: recommendations for lightning network routing, the node charging model, a risk summary, the specifics of the softfork changes, and more.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ll leave you with a brief list of requirements to make Lightning Networks a reality:\n\n* A soft-fork is required, to protect against malleability and to allow new signature modes.\n* A new peer-to-peer protocol needs to be designed for the lightning network, including routing.\n* Blame and rating systems are needed for lightning network nodes.  You don\xe2\x80\x99t have to trust them, but it sucks if they go down as your money is probably stuck until the timeout.\n* More refinements (eg. relative OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY) to simplify and tighten timeout times.\n* Wallets need to learn to use this, with UI handling of things like timeouts and fallbacks to the bitcoin network (sorry, your transaction failed, you\xe2\x80\x99ll get your money back in N days).\n* You need to be online every 40 days to check that an old HTLC hasn\xe2\x80\x99t leaked, which will require some alternate solution for occasional users (shut down channel, have some third party, etc).\n* A server implementation needs to be written.\n\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work!

Any amount over the charge, they simply issue change to whatever address you have linked in your Uber profile or a separate change address you specify.\n\nI would also like to point out that if you have a CC that cannot be charged, they always have the option to simply suspend your account... which would most likely be the case.": 2, "I love that they're 2-5 years out.

Let's not be callous in our approach, remember their situation is shitty - us yelling I told you so does not leave them with a nice sentiment.

When you look at the data, the extreme price fluctuations that have occurred are due to market manipulation and extreme conditions - either a country threatens to ban bitcoins or some pundits lauds bitcoins as the second coming of Jesus. \n\nIf you look at all the data we have so far, and ignore the extreme fluctuations between October 2013 to late April 2014 what you see is a pretty stable, pretty predictable price increase that will only continue barring there are no outside interference as we\'ve seen before.\n\nMy facebook status at the beginning of this year recommended that people purchase bitcoin because the price will stabilize in April/ June barring any outside interference, and like magic it did. Not because I\'m some economic mastermind, but because I just looked at the data and saw the obvious trend.\n\nNow what makes what\'s going on in Europe so dangerous is because bitcoin, once again, is being presented as a messiah for all of Greece\'s problems... it isn\'t and we need to be careful that we don\'t present it as such. Prices are going to react to European situation but we have to be cautious, and frankly skeptical, if it starts to rapidly break the trend.\n\nAnd if the price does sky rocket get those fingers ready on the sale button because you could be in for a tidy profit... just be prepared for another recovery period before it returns to form and the predictable "bitcoin is dead" mantra that will undoubtedly follow.': 7, 'Brilliant job, Brian Armstrong.
