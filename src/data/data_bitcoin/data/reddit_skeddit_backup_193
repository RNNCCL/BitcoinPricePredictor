Maybe that was a lie... We are a month short of a year.  Sorry.**\n\n> Here it is if anyone is interested. \n\nI think that was the right link.  Is it broken for you?  I just checked and it seems to be right.\n\n> You will note that most of the questions being raised were answered last year.\n\nLuckily Yahoo has a transcript feature.  It ended with the following (partial) summary:\n\n30:03 **Chris:** Well, we have people encroaching our space. We\'ll wrap this up soon. One or two more questions.\n\n30:08 Granted there\'s a little bit of a controversy there because I think somebody, it was either\n\n30:13 misquoted, or expressed that a good number of books will be stored on block chain. And\n\n30:17 then people were kind of taking it apart. Maybe they were being a little pedantic. You\n\n30:21want to clarify the record on that, just so that we can broadcast that to the community?\n\n30:25 **Paul:** Oh, certainly. It\'s a tempest in a teapot. We did a demo where we took somewhere near\n\n30:38 29,000 books out of the Gutenberg library, all public domain, open source books. And\n\n30:46 we entered a hash for each book along with metadata, the author, the title, that sort\n\n30:56 of thing. And created an entry and entered it into a chain in Factom. So there\'s a Gutenberg\n\n31:03 chain in Factom. It has an entry for each book. It has also this metadata in it. And\n\n31:11 then through Factom and the level D.B., you can do a search and find that book and data.\n\n31:17 And you could rehash the book, and verify, and validate this book is exactly the one\n\n31:22 they had when they created with this chain.\n\n31:25 So over time, a hundred years from now, if they found a set of books, and some of them\n\n31:32 were corrupted, and some of them weren\'t, they could figure out what was corrupted,\n\n31:35 what wasn\'t, and validate them against the Factom chain.\n\n31:39 **Chris:** So that\'s the official answer.\n\n31:40 **Paul:** That\'s the demo.\n\n31:41 **Chris:** That\'s the expounded answer.\n\n31:43 **Paul:** Yes. But what was the reason? To secure books? No. The reason was this is something you could\n\n31:50 download, read yourself, see how we used the A.P.I. because all the code is open source.\n\n31:55 And you can say, "Oh, I would like to secure medical records," or "I would like to secure\n\n31:59 legal documents." Well, of course, you would do it exactly the same way. But I don\'t actually\n\n32:05 have legal documents or medical records that I\'d want to use in the demo so we used some\n\n32:10 other source of data.\n\n32:11 **Chris: Okay. That seemed like a very easy enough clarification. So there you go. Not a big**\n\n32:13 **deal. We appreciate the transparency, of course. You only get so much time in front of a microphone**\n\n32:19 **on the stage, and people pick and choose little bits and pieces and you know...**\n\n32:23 **Paul:** I think most of the criticism was coming from people that weren\'t in the talk. Because,\n\n32:27 I think, it was fairly clear in the talk this was a demo so that people could see how the\n\n32:32 A.P.I. was.\n\n32:32 **Chris:** I wasn\'t there in the talk. I\'m at these conferences always, but in this room. Right now, you are\n\n32:39 missing a talk as well.\n\n32:41**Paul:** No!\n\n32:42 **Chris:** You only have so much time. And we only do what we can. So hopefully...\n\n32:43 **Paul:** Well, the video is available. Mo is putting the video out within 24 hours.\n\n32:46 **Chris:** Yes. That\'s what I typically do. I\'m the last one to see all the conference videos. I have\n\n32:50 to hear bits and pieces from everybody at the show. But it\'s nice to get reviews on\n\n32:54 who did what before it comes out.\n\n32:56 **Paul:** Sure.\n\n32:57 **Chris:** I know where to focus my attention. Well, Paul, it was wonderful to meet you and to\n\n33:00 interview you. Is there anything else you want to say to the audience? Where can they\n\n33:03 learn more about Factom?\n\n33:05 **Paul:** You can go to the Factom.org. From there, you can find our white paper. From there you\n\n33:09 can find the consensus paper that we\'ve released for review. You can find the links to the\n\n33:17 Gutenberg demo. And you can find the explorer that lets you look at the records that were\n\n33:23 entered and see how it works. The A.P.I. is documented. If you\'re a developer, you can\n\n33:31 play with that. And of course, you can find contact information to us.\n\nIt seems in the interview you had your questions answered, and seemed to acknowledge the transparency.\n\n> Not exactly sure what has changed...\n\nI am not exactly sure how in person you seem to acknowledge the transparency and the explanations, and even say "no big deal".

The principle idea that my logic is based on is maybe something that i didn't articulate well enough. There are basic human needs that have proven consistent when you look at how/why societies evolve and they both can fall into the categories of opportunities and protection. We should never rely on any one system to fully protect us nor should create a system that creates unlimited opportunities without any oversight. \n\nI understand your concern for decentralized processes and how they can run ramped but thats assuming the worst just like on the opposite end how regulating monopolies have protected us against fully centralized processes. We already have created regulation that acknowledges the risk monopolies brings to a complex system of trade due to the unpredictability of human behavior. Thats why they are not allowed. Same can be made for the decentralized side of the spectrum. Regulations can be created that prevent a forever extending system of untethered opportunities but that will make us unstable just like relying on one single process makes us unstable. \n\nI feel like you logic is accurate from more of a generalized perspective which can limit complete understanding because of how generalize thoughts keep a perspective settles on the surface instead of diving into a deeper understanding of the concept.

Either way, yeah - it just assigns each miner a different chunk of nonces, and each individual just scans by incrementing. Makes sense.  \n\nAh okay. So final summary: 2 miners not in a pool are scanning for nonces and it doesn\'t matter if their nonces match due to different payout keys.  Thus in effect they\'re just scanning different 2^32 chunks of nonces from a hugely larger set. If somehow their block headers were the same though - e.g. by having the same payout keys - then they would be mining the same nonces and we\'d have a problem, but that shouldn\'t happen.

It\'s not that the big blocks get increasingly orphaned (because actually, they don\'t) as you increase the bandwidth and resources of larger miners.\n\nRather, orphaning is effected by block size because of bandwidth asymmetries on the network. You (as a smaller miner) can\'t mine on top of a block (or even headers) that you haven\'t seen or haven\'t downloaded.\n\nBut that big block can still exist out there even if you haven\'t seen or downloaded it, and others might be mining on it (even in spite of the bandwidth asymmetry). But meanwhile a smaller miner is mining on top of something else, which will get orphaned when it\'s discovered to be not the best chaintip - especially if other miners (a significant portion) have already been mining on the other non-smaller-miner chaintip. They can\'t upload/broadcast/publish faster than the mega-bandwidthers anyway.\n\nSo orphaning does not really allow smaller miners to stop larger miners from mining big blocks, especially to the extent that the smaller miner\'s bandwidth can\'t push out their blocks fast enough. Over time, their orphans mean that others are accumulating more BTC to buy/build more hashrate on the other side of the bandwidth asymmetries, thus the hashrate consolidation.... (but see my [other comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3uz0im/eli5_if_large_blocks_hurt_miners_with_slow/cxl0728) for the good news; as long as we keep an eye on orphan rate and even try to tune it downwards more, it\'s possible to keep everything working pretty well, I think.)\n\nThis is where people got interested in the "weak block" concept. However, in http://gnusha.org/bitcoin-wizards/2015-12-02.log I expressed some concerns that "weak block" just shifts the bandwidth requirements around from block publishing to weak block downloading, which while it could possibly make more even utilization of bandwidth, can\'t really magically increase local bandwidth heh. So weak block may be useful, but I doubt it minimizes orphan rate in a world with increasingly big blocks and increasingly big weak blocks. (The size of the weak block and the size of the block have to be related somehow, because otherwise the concept is pointless. e.g. by receiving all of the weak blocks, you have all the transactions that would have been included in the strong block.

The takeaway appeared to be that you need the registration marks (the squares) and a pretty small area at the middle of each "pixel". This is obviously dependent on the QR reader software but would appear to make sense.\n\nThen there is how much the QR code can be distorted. This is obviously software dependent but it seemed that the QR code recognition was sensitive to shear and bending but somewhat OK with being keystoned.\n\nThen there are the acceptable levels of dark & light. I haven\'t seen anything solid on this but you\'ll need some level of contrast. I believe that inverse QR codes are not acceptable. Light and dark colors can be substituted for black & white though.\n\nThen there is error correction. QR codes are resilient against a certain level of "damage" to the data pixels (not so much to the registration marks) and this can be set when the QR code is generated. This allows you to overlay some picture over the QR code and may help with some disguise.\n\nEdit: It also seems to me that the registration marks do not need to be square. So that could be an option too.\n\nThis is just my understanding and there may be some misapprehension in there but I hope it helps.
