As to why it only applies to free transactions:  because miners could just flip a switch to disable it and earn more income as a result.\n\nSo there are a couple of considerations to this-- it sends miners down the adventure of "tuning" for better income, which can have bad outcomes if carried a long way-- it also would make policies less consistent which increases doublespending risk (there is a continuum here); and then there is a principled concern: as creators of the software we owe it to all the users of the software to make the software behave in a way which is in their best interest; and that means miners too.  There can be some spongyness is trading off between overall system best interest and absolute short term selfish best interest, meaning there isn\'t just one right answer...  but to the extent that we trade-off fee income for helping the system, at least historically we\'ve preferred to do it in terms of the free transaction area, which is simple and easy to understand and can be controlled.\n\nWhat I\'ve proposed elsewhere is changing how the blocksize limit works to account for these costs better; and in doing so this would align the incentives so that the income maximizing approach would also be the system health maximizing approach, and it wouldn\'t have the above problem of a conflict in incentives.': 9, 'Even better idea: allow for a new transaction type where you can define the inputs to a transaction with a simple "list comprehension" syntax.\n\nSo instead of writing a transaction with 100 inputs and the tx being really large (because you have to list each one indicidually), you could write that same tx by saying "all inputs like this one" and it would be considerably less size.

If the discount is the same in the future as today, people might as well keep the input around since nothing is lost by not merging it right now.\n\nIf we do want to encourage merging inputs, I have another idea that might encourage that. We could tax each input by age. For example 1 satoshi per day. So the sooner you merge, the less tax you pay.

Pretty typical.\n\nThere are several hash/crypto parts which can't be shrunk much without making the system weaker.  Let's start with those:\n\n1.  For each input, we need to know the transaction it came from.  txids are **32** bytes long.\n2.  For each input, we need a public key (**33** bytes), and a signature (**64** bytes).\n3. For each output, we need to know the pubkey which can spend it.  pubkeys are **20** bytes long.\n\nSo that's 32 + 33 + 64 + (20 * 2) = **169** bytes.\n\nThe remaining 57 bytes encode the following:\n\n1.  Version number (**4** bytes)\n2.  Input count (**1** byte)\n3.  Output count (**1** byte)\n4.  Locktime (**4** bytes)\n5.  Output amount (**8** bytes, times 2)\n6.  Output script length (**1** byte, times 2)\n7.  Input index, showing which output we're using (**4** bytes)\n8.  Input script length (**1** byte)\n9.  Input sequence number (**4** bytes)\n10.  DER encoding for signature (**8** bytes)\n11.  Output script opcodes: (**5** bytes, times 2)\n12.  Input script opcodes: (**2** bytes)\n\nYou'll note that fields (1), (3), (6) and (8) are already 1 byte long: that's bitcoin's varint format which uses 1 byte for small numbers.  We can't save much there.\n\nVersion number, locktime and input index (ie. (1), (4) and (7)) are generally low, so could use the same encoding, saving **9** bytes.\n\nOutput amounts up to 42 bitcoins can be represented in a 5-byte varint, saving **6** bytes for the two outputs.\n\nThe DER encoding (10) is just stupid, and has been a source of malleability and bugs in the past.  That's **8** bytes.\n\nThe scripts cost us 12 bytes; 15 if you count the lengths.  Eliminating scriptability altogether would save that, but ugly hacks like packing these common patterns into single opcodes would get back **9** bytes.\n\nIn total, we've managed to shave off 9 + 6 + 8 + 9 = **32** bytes (and we'd have to do a hard fork to get those first two savings).  That's only 14%.\n\nAnd that's why it hasn't been done: too little gain :(\n\n": 17, "Compression would at most get 10-15%, much of the data is highly random (keys, signatures), the scripts and a couple other things will compress a bit, but it wouldn't do much.": 8, 'For data compression-- there really isn\'t much that can be done, sure.

Instead of a txid in and vout index,  an index into the utxo set as off a recent height could be used (if you want to spend unconfirmeds, set a bit andtransmit more data)-- the real value could be used under the hashing so there is no ambiguity;  ECDSA could be replaced with 256-bit BLS signatures. Amounts could be replaced with the variable length encoding used in the utxo set.\n\nAssuming the values take up 4 bytes, A 2 in 2 out transaction would take:\n\n1+1+3+32+3+32+1+32+4+32+4 = 145 bytes;  compared to 4+1+32+4+4+33+72+32+4+4+33+72+1+20+8+20+8 = 352\n\nNow one of the benefits of BLS signatures, is that they can be aggregated, so if we assume that, the 32+32 in that goes away and becomes shared for the whole block, so if the block processes 2000 inputs the total signature cost is 32/2000 which we\'ll call 0 and the marginal cost for that 2 in 2 out transaction becomes  81 bytes.\n\nSo this is less than 1/4th the size. Now what-- what other effects did this have?  well all the features were made optional, and potentially much more expensive if you actually use them. Perhaps a few extra bytes could be added to get back sighash flags or per-output pubkey trypes, so they\'re not too terribly expensive to use.  Unfortunately it also makes signature validation about (say) 8x slower, and switches to a system that has a less well trusted cryptographic assumptions. It also makes the system much more complex in that you have a radically different transaction format depending on what features you\'re using, and you get punished for using certain feature because they make the txn much larger (or even larger for sending values that have many significant digits).\n\nAnd what that got was only a factor of 4...
