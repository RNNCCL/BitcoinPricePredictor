And they can mine any valid transactions they like. A valid transaction could have 0 fees. So they could make up a bunch of addresses and just have transactions going in circles just to fill disk space. Why do that? Because effectively, you would be forcing full nodes and other miners to start looking at having to store several terabytes of data in just a few months. It could start to go up to being 1 Terabyte every 8 days or so. That would consume disk space, bandwidth, CPU for blockchain analysis. The goal would be for them to kick out the casuals. The rough cost just for storage would go to about $5000 a year. No biggy for a big business but maybe 10x-100x what a casual bitcoin peasant like me would want to pay to play.\n\nSo Gavin had an idea to slowly raise this limit over time.\n\nThat may or may not stick because it\'s a hard fork and anytime you have a hard fork you have to do a little game theory: stay with the old system or switch? And think about which direction the value goes or stays on and whether or not you get swindled by moving forward or lose out by staying behind. Really tough trade offs.\n\nNext something like Maidsafe etc. Um having nodes all point to the cloud for their storage may or may not help. De-duplicating data might make it cheaper, centralizing data might make it censorship attackable, decentralizing it might mean data disappears out from under you, unless you do math to make sure there\'s redundancy, unless the redundancy is fragile and no one is really keeping up their copy, etc etc etc. Not sure if it helps or not.\n\n': 6, "I'm a plumber, not a cryptologist, but are you saying using something like the maidsafe network idea for the decentralized storage of all those 1gb blocks?\n\nI'm sure that must have been thought of.

He said Bitcoin was a bad store of value in 2011, yet here we are, and the price of Bitcoin is orders of magnitude higher.  Thefts are irrelevant, just like they were in 2011.  Anything of value an be stolen.  Transactions do NOT take 1 hour and 48 minutes.  Every person who has ever used Bitcoin knows that transactions take seconds.  It's only confirmation (settlement) that takes time.   Legacy payment networks take far longer than Bitcoin's *average of 10 minutes* for settlement of transactions.  It is a user's choice if he wants to wait for settlement or not.  Merchants routinely accept credit card payments with no guarantee of settlement.\n\nWhy is bitcoin better than fiat money?  Because any person in any country can use Bitcoin to send money in any amount to any other person in any country at any time, practically instantly and practically free without requiring permission from any third party.  This cannot be done with what he refers to as 'real' (fiat) money.  The only way fiat moves is with the cooperation of a bank or banks with with each transactor needs a relationship.  Bitcoin moves person to person online without requiring a trusted third party.  That's the problem Bitcoin solves.  It's digital money that works the same way for everyone who chooses to use it, without regard for the whims of some controlling party who may or may not operate in the same jurisdiction as the transactors, who may or may not have the best interests of the transactors at heart, who may or may not be above stealing the transactor's money or stopping the transactor's payments, who may or may not be above manipulating the money supply for their own advantage at the expense of the users.\n\nNone of the same arguments we've been hearing for years can change the fact that more people understand Bitcoin's useful properties today than did three years ago, just as Bitcoin's users expected.  The only way to move money over the internet person to person is for the transactors to choose to value bitcoins as money, and that is what some people are choosing to do.  This is not theoretical - it is happening now, it's been happening for years, and it shows all signs of continuing to happen.  \n\nThe only valid point he makes is that we don't know what exactly the future will look like in terms of transaction fees.  But that does not change the fact that people who make the informed decision to think of bitcoins as money can do things with their money that people who do not think of bitcoins as money cannot do.

To me, Bitcoin is a *store of wealth* that has the added benefit of being able to be spent like money in ways that today's money can't be spent.  \n  \nOne statistic that I like to bring to people's attention is that the store of wealth market (just gold and government bonds---ie not even including stocks and corporate bonds) is $63 *trillion*++.  That. is. HUGE!  The 500 billion (in revenues, mind you) remittance market is paltry in comparison.  Moreover, the dollar denominated value of worldwide government bond holdings more than *doubled* in the last decade.

It just confirms what it wants. Whenever it\'s mining it just -- Eew, and it mines, transactions... Watch it reward! Look at that mining.\nThe Bitcoin is really pretty badass. It has no regard for any other currency whatsoever. Look at it, it\'s just hashing, and mining blocks. Eew! What\'s that? Silk Road? Oh that\'s nasty. Bitcoin\'s so nasty.

It says, "You do all the work for us, Bitcoin, and we\'ll just profit whatever you mine, how\'s that? What\'daya say, stupid?"\nLook at this currency: "Thanks for the treat, stupid!"\n"Hey, come back here," says the Bitcoin.\nCurrencies don\'t care, and you know what? The alt-coins do it too. Look at these little alt-coins. They\'re like "Thanks stupid! Thanks for the mining! See you later." The Bitcoin does all the work and all these other currencies just pick up the scraps.\nAt nightime the Bitcoin goes mining, because it\'s hashing. Look! Here comes a fierce battle between a government currency and Bitcoin. I wonder what will happen?\nLook at this, there\'s the Bitcoin just hashing a block, and then look, "Get away from me!" says the government, "Get away from me!" Bitcoin don\'t care. Bitcoin smacks the shit out of it. And the government comes back and it lashes at the Bitcoin.\nOh, little does the Bitcoin know, FYI: it\'s been hacked! It\'s been forked by the 51% attack, so while it\'s hashing the block chain -- eew, that\'s disgusting -- all the hacked blocks are seeping into the Bitcoin\'s block chain, and it forks out. Look at that forked fuck.\nNow the Bitcoin is going to fork out for a few minutes, and then it\'s going to get right back up and start hashing all over again, because it\'s a resiliant little bastard.\nLook at this! Like nothing happened! The Bitcoin gets right back up and continues hashing the block chain.\nHow disgusting.\nAnd of course, what does the Bitcoin have to hash for the next two weeks?\nTransactions.\nThe Bitcoin: it doesnt give a shit\xe2\x84\xa2': 7, 'Drats.': 1, '/u/changetip 5000 bits\n\n> Look at that forked fuck.\n\nlol\n\n\n': 1}, ('[Guide] Setting up Trezor + Electrum 2.02beta + armory on a Raspberry Pi 2.
