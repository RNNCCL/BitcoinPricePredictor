Not trying to give you a hard time, btw.  \n  \nEDIT: I think maybe the answer you are referring to is *below* at this point. And here I was rifling through your website for the answers... I think I've found what I was looking for, thanks.  \n  \nEDIT2: Could you reference the solution (link? video?) you use for applying the non transparent scratch off later as part of the printing process? I'm curious to see how that works.\n": 2, '> How exactly do they guarantee this?\n\nDo you mean which precautions we take - or "how" we guarantee? If the question is the first, please study our product specification. If it is the second one, we do so as a statement in writing\n.\nBitcoin Suisse AG is a Swiss financial intermediary, active in the market since 2013.\n\nWhen we guarantee something, we take on the liability. Thus - if a certificate is unopened, un-tampered with, yet compromised - we are liable, and our reputation destroyed. Under Swiss law, our entire management would also face long prison terms and steep fines.\n\nYou will find all data about the product in the various product description PDF\'s available for download on our web-site.\n\nPrecautions include:\n\n- Strong "true" random numbers for key generation\n- All key handling and final assembly done internally at our offices, not where the prints are produced.\n- There is a four eye principle in place during key handling and final assembly.\n- Keys are generated by our self-made software in a completely offline and windowless environment, at our offices, which are also to be considered a secure environment for purposes of financial dealings.\n- Our software does not visually or otherwise display private keys to the operators.\n- Private keys are printed and covered with a non-transparent scratch off layer as a single process.\n- Keys are not stored outside of the certificates any longer than the time it takes to make the days production batch, are never left unguarded, and until nested inside their respective certificates, always under a 4 eye principle.\n- The offline environment is wiped after each production batch.\n- The spools of the printer involved in the printing of the private key strips are physically destroyed immediately after printing by fire, after each batch.\n\nThe issuance of physical bitcoin certificates constitutes less than half a percent of our business. It would indeed make no sense if we risked our name and reputation by issuing this product, if it did not meet the strictest of security and quality concerns.\n\nAll physical bitcoin products delivered by 3rd party, and perhaps especially those which are proprietary loaded, will always involve 3rd party trust. We make this very clear, also in our product description.\n\nThe big difference is whether one chooses to trust, what is often a private person or small startup from Hong Kong - or a financial institution which has been professionally working with bitcoin for several years in central Switzerland.\n\nAs to what needs our product fills - and why it is made as it is, please also refer to the product description.\nOur product is analogue bitcoin cash, designed to be transferable between 3rd parties without the use of electronics & internet, and without the immediate need for sweeping for concerns of compromised private keys.\nWe cannot secure them with BIP-38 or multi-signature or similar means, for the same reason. This would destroy their 3rd party interchangeable "cash" property.\n\nWe have secured the certificates against tampering, Ultrasound, X-Ray, Water, Tear, Probing, Solvents etc. to the degree possible while keeping costs at reasonable levels.\n\nThe clients who purchase our certificates are non-crypto savvy investors who wish to hold bitcoin as they hold their bearer bonds or gold bars - in the safe. It is also BTC-enthusiasts, who wish to surprise family and friends with a small, but nicely wrapped bitcoin present under the Christmas tree, or as part of company handouts at conferences etc.\n': 4, ">>No offence but I don't think you understand exactly how multi-sig works.\n\nNone taken but sure we do, what makes you think otherwise? Our complaints with making multisig/BIP38 certificates however remains the same. \n\n- Need to involve client and custom make certificate for that client alone.\n- Client if passing on cert, will have to pass along that extra key, which is not stored in the certificate.\n- All holders/owners need to be tech-savvy.\n\nIt would work for some kind of clients, namely bitcoin savvy ones, who intend to keep the certificate and not pass it along. But the work involved would be unjustifiable.\n\nIt would also render the certificate rather useless for circulation, it would disqualify ordering of certificates for non-bitcoiners, and it would make sweeping technical for the non-bitcoiners.\n\nIn short, we would likely end up with a product that would appeal to 30 people on the planet, all of them which have better options available.\n\nTrustless multi-sig solutions cannot be made unless custom made for a client, and that rules out cheap production. It also narrows the use case and customer vase for the certificate.\n\nIt would certainly be worth while for an art object style physical bitcoin solution, or perhaps large denomination single owner certificates, but not for the product we indented to create.\n\nYou are however not the first to suggest multisig, so perhaps we should offer that in some future product.": 1}, ('Requesting help for bitcoin', 1): {'Either pay around 15 dollars for 8 dollars in bitcoin via virwox.com(just paypal needed) or sign up for coinbase or other site like that and link your bank account.

(like yesterday:  "pgp keys" protecting Satoshi\'s BTC?   Just wow...) \n\nBut I have to ask:  What do you plan on putting in the "downsides" on the version 2 article?\n\nHopefully you could shed some perspective on the developer infighting and how something as simple as removing what was designed as a temporary SPAM limit cap by satoshi (1MB) has caused great consternation.  I mean the fact we have certain Core Developers thinking "1MB is already too big" yet we are already hitting the cap repeatedly just shows how out of touch some are!\n\nMaybe also something else about the Chinese influence since they own the chip fabs run most of the mining pools that are popular?\n\nOh even better yet, all the [score hidden] nonsense around here these days, I would label certain forum admins as a threat also!  Mass censorship campaigns in regards to an open source software project is definitely a gem!\n\nOf course you are probably looking at bigger red-flag issues, but those of us that live in Bitcoin land really do think some of those topics should be included!': -1, 'Hehehehehe She own some bitcoins.': 3, 'Moon': 9, 'I enjoyed the article.

First, one share of GBTC is *not* worth 1/10th of a bitcoin. Since the fund takes a 2% fee out annually, currently one share of GBTC is only worth about 0.095 bitcoin, which is a significant difference.\n\nAnother point. While you correctly state that it will be about the year 2140 before all 21 million bitcoins are issued, it is always important to note that, for practical purposes, nearly all of the 21 million will have been issued within the next 20 years. The block reward decreases exponentially, so it will take another century to technically reach the max amount, but for practical purposes most of the currency will have been issued much, much sooner. \n\nI\'m afraid when people use that 2140 number most people assume it is issued at a linear rate.\n\nI wish more articles would state something like, "Within 20 years almost all of the 21 million bitcoins will have been issued."': 8, "It's true of every group of people that has at least one member with missing limbs.
