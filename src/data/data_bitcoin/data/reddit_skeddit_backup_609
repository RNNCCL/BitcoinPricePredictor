I wrote a bit about this here:\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2u018i/in_bill_gates_ama_he_worried_about_bitcoin/co4iex8?context=3\n\nIn fairness Gates did actually say something along the lines of 'bitcoin has this problem just like any other new technology'. But still, why even bring it up? \n\nSure if he worked at the department of defence and was known as a top security, sure, that's relevant to his job and field of work. But that's not his position. He's a technologist that speaks 3-4 lines on a new technology and brings up the fact that it could be used for terrorism. It's just ridiculous. It's as if every single comment or article on Google Driverless cars also mention that 'terrorists could use the driverless cars for suicide bomb attacks'. It'd be a completely ridiculous thing to say unless you specifically worked in the field of anti-terrorism or if you were speaking at an anti-terrorism conference. But outside of that niche context it's just basic slander really. \n\nEspecially when the statistics show that you're as likely to die from a fridge falling ontop of you as from terrorism. It's just basic scaremongering. \n\nThe reason I say this is because it's terrible unproductive. For example Bill Gates is a huge fan of Mpesa and digital money. And he doesn't like bitcoin because it's volatile and because your money can go missing if it's sent to the wrong person. \n\nWhat's interesting is that Kipochi already built a bitcoin wallet that works on feature phones exactly like Mpesa using an STK interface (not SMS) to get something like this on feature phones: http://movotek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/m-pesa-movotek.jpg\n\nThat wallet could if they wanted interface with Bitreserve or Coinapult Locks or Tether and lock in the price to that of the dollar, euro or gold. Oh and the transactions could indeed be reversible like Changetip, yet built on bitcoin. And the transactions could be extremely cheap. All built on bitcoin. \n\nSo you get cheap transactions and a stable value (dollar) on your phone. Only it was shut down by carriers at a time when bitcoin barely had a reputation and didn't have a single billion-dollar company accepting it.\n\nMeanwhile in Kenya 90% of transactions are done with Mpesa which charges an insane 10% if you want to send $6 to a friend and the phone credits are in Kenyan shilling, a currency which averaged 11% inflation the past decade, saw 30% inflation a few years ago, saw big volatility swings versus other currencies the past years.\n\nIf Gates was really excited about digital currency he'd fund some research and some non-profit digital currency initiatives both using cryptocurrency and non-cryptocurrencies.

Just mentioning some of its positives while mentioning some of its negatives is just commenting on it, it's not 'backing' or 'advocating' for bitcoin, at least in my opinion. \n\nHe seems more like the guy to tell you cars are better than walking in that they're fast (cheap transactions), but the problem is that it's bad for your health to drive everywhere and bad for the environment too (non-reversible transactions, volatile currency, terrorism concerns). That's not really advocating for driving or using bitcoin in my opinion. Those are the kinds of comments Gates made. There's definite positive bits in there I agree, but 'backing bitcoin' like the article says imo is way too strong.\n\nI'll call him an enthusiast sure, advocate is a bit too strong for me personally. But I can see why you call him that, I don't strongly disagree on that, it's not a stretch of imagination just a bit too optimistic for my taste.\n\n> Funding terrorism is valid... whether you think it's been over-hyped or not.\n\nI already said that it's a valid concern. I'm not denying it's not *a* concern. But whether it's important or not **matters**. It wouldn't be sensible to to ask Bill Gates every single time 'Microsoft Software is a concern, how do you feel about that, Bill? Knowing that terrorists might use it?' in every single interview. That'd just be slander, don't you agree. Hell that'd be a much more valid thing to bring up, seeing as the story is that 9/11 terrorists used MS Flight Simulator to plan their terrorist attack. Obviously technology will be abused and obviously it'll ALWAYS be a concern for any technology (phones, cars, microwaves) to be used by criminals, that's **not my point** (in bold seeing as you didn't seem to get that from my last post) But you don't normally bring that up unless it's really relevant or important.\n\n> Ultimately you look at Gates as some irrational critic\n\nNot at all. I think he's one of the most sensible guys on this planet. And I'm not saying he's just a critic (critic isn't negative you know, as in, critical thinking, one of the most important things we should apply to everything in life). What I'm saying is that it doesn't make sense to talk about terrorism every single time you mention bitcoin. That doesn't mean it's not a valid concern, it's just ridiculous.\n\nDid you read my example on the Google Driverless Cars? What if Bill Gates said they were fantastic, but every single time he'd say 'but I'm concerned that terrorists will let driverless cars drive into large crowds in suicide bomb attacks'. It'd be a completely valid concern, but it'd also be ridiculous to bring that up every single time, in my opinion. You really think when Larry Page gets on TV he gets questioned whether Google Driverless cars, or any other google products, might get used for terrorism, and whether that's a concern? Like everywhere he goes? Or that Bill Gates talks about terrorism concerns of other products everywhere he goes, like Microsoft's Hololens that allows virtual reality combat training of terrorists? No, that's ridiculous. And not because they're not valid concerns as they clearly are, just not very big ones, big enough to bring them up all the time.\n\nBut I guess we disagree.": 1, "The Internet allows communications to Terrosit, cash and western union transfers funds terrosim, gun makers helps terrosits......

Look at 10 Elon Musk interviews, they're literally all the same safe for 5% of it talking about some recent development. I must have heard him say 'reason from first principles' a million times now haha.

It's hilarious but it extends to people like Gates, too. \n\nWhich is generally why I don't watch interviews and such anymore from extremely well known people. There's just too little room for error to see any outspoken opinions surface, can't blame them either.

As the first licensed U.S.-based Bitcoin exchange , it will help legitimize the digital currency in the eyes of the public as well as the broader financial community.\n\nIt was no coincidence that Coinbase won $75 million in venture capital funding last week . Among the investors were the New York Stock Exchange, former Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: \nC) Chief Executive Officer Vikram Pandit, and Spanish banking giant Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (NYSE: BBVA ).\n\n"To have an organized exchange that has the backing of thoughtful venture capitalists and investors addresses one of the main problems with Bitcoin: its extreme volatility," Duke University finance professor and cryptocurrency expert Campbell R. Harvey told The Wall Street Journal . "Bitcoin has been sorely in need of something like this."\n\nBut just as importantly, the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange finally will give U.S. investors a safe, secure, and seamless option for trading Bitcoin.\n\nWell, at least for investors in 24 states. Financial regulations require Coinbase to win approval on a state-by-state basis.\n\nEven so, the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange is a major step forward. Until now, U.S. Bitcoin traders had to use exchanges based overseas. But the lack of regulation, inadequate security, and difficulty in getting U.S. dollars in and out of these exchanges has made them extremely risky.\n\nRemember, it was just about this time last year that the Japan-based Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange started to unravel . Mt. Gox was by far the largest Bitcoin exchange in the world.\n\nWhen it collapsed in February 2014, it lost 750,000 customer bitcoins and 100,000 of its own. The Mt. Gox disaster remains a black mark on the digital currency. It\'s a big reason many have continued to avoid Bitcoin.\n\nMt. Gox hasn\'t been the only Bitcoin operation with security issues. Many Bitcoin wallet services and exchanges have been hacked over the past few years.\n\nIt\'s still happening. Just a few weeks ago, BitStamp - a large Bitcoin exchange based in Slovenia - was hacked. BitStamp said it lost 19,000 bitcoins worth about $5 million.\n\nThe lousy security at so many Bitcoin companies slowed mainstream adoption - and rightly so.\n\nThis is why the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange will make a difference.\n\nEarly Bitcoin companies operated on the fringes of the financial world, unregulated and with little understanding of how to keep people\'s money safe. The Coinbase Exchange promises to change all that.\n\nJust being regulated in the United States and by individual states makes the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange much safer than overseas alternatives. Beyond being licensed and regulated, the Coinbase Exchange has put extensive security measures in place...\n\nHow the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange Is Better\nCoinbase went to great lengths to ensure the safety of customer money. Since Coinbase has already operated a wallet service, as well as an easy way to simply buy Bitcoin directly, it already has a robust security system.\n\nFor one thing, Coinbase has insurance. Few Bitcoin companies have bothered with insurance - so they had no way to cover losses.\n\nCoinbase also keeps most of its bitcoins offline in "cold storage." That means the bitcoins are not linked to the Internet where hackers could get at them. In addition, the data is heavily encrypted and stored in multiple physical locations around the world.\n\nTo prevent internal theft, all Coinbase workers must pass a criminal background check. All employee hard drives are encrypted and use a two-step verification process.\n\nCustomers must use strong passwords. They are also subjected to the two-step verification process. That means when customers log-in to their Coinbase account, the company texts code to the customer\'s phone. They must type that code in to complete the log-in process. The code can\'t be re-used.\n\nNot only that, but logging in from a different computer requires e-mail verification from that same computer.\n\nI can vouch for the system\'s effectiveness. I just tried to log in to my Coinbase account from my work PC, but was blocked because I clicked on the e-mail verification that came from my iPad - a different device.\n\nOther Details About the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange\nSo it\'s secure, but how does it work?\n\nFirst, users must have a Coinbase account. To trade Bitcoins on the exchange, a user must fund that account with either Bitcoin or U.S. dollars. Since Coinbase already allows customers to link to their personal bank accounts, fund transfers are far easier than with most foreign Bitcoin exchanges.\n\nCustomers will be able place orders to buy or sell at set prices. Buyers will be charged a 0.25% fee, while sellers will pay no fee. Customers also pay no fees for moving funds between their Coinbase wallet and exchange accounts.\n\nOf course, the long-term question is whether the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange will succeed. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong boldly told The Wall Street Journal that "our goal is to become the world\'s largest exchange."\n\nThe Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler, might have something to say about that. Last week they announced their own plan for a U.S.-based Bitcoin exchange called Gemini.\n\nThe Gemini Bitcoin exchange would partner with a New York-chartered bank. It\'s unclear if that means Gemini can bypass the state-by-state approval slowing Coinbase down. But it does mean Gemini is eligible for FDIC insurance.\n\nIn a Jan. 23 blog post, Cameron Winklevoss said that Gemini, too, will emphasize security.\n\n"Your U.S. dollars on Gemini will be as safe and secure as they are in your bank account today," he wrote.\n\nHaving not one but two U.S.-based Bitcoin exchanges will do even more to speed Bitcoin adoption. So far, it looks like 2015 will indeed be a crucial turning point for the digital currency.\n\nThe Bottom Line : The arrival of the Coinbase Bitcoin Exchange does more than give legitimacy to the digital currency. Because it\'s regulated, U.S.-based and focused on security, the Coinbase exchange will also help build confidence in Bitcoin. And that, in turn, will speed adoption.\n\nThe New Year couldn\'t come soon enough for Bitcoin... But even as a lot of bad news grabbed the headlines, positive things were happening away from the spotlight. And those powerful trends have set the stage for some big leaps forward in 2015.Here\'s why this year will be pivotal for Bitcoin...\n\nFollow me on Twitter@DavidGZeiler.\n': 2, 'I just want to point out, BTC-e has a similar problem.': 1, 'This.

You can use one if you prefer, but it isn't necessary by any means. Compared to the existing model, the optional autonomy offered by btc is an incredibly valuable feature.\n\nThe difficulty in this business is in converting from btc, into the local currency. Many smaller economies do not have the necessary bitcoin demand required for the remittance-provider to convert large amounts of btc into fiat dollars. Additionally, the infrastructure of third-world countries introduces an additional degree of difficulty. If you're processing remittances for people who are unbanked, you'll certainly need some type of physical location, or somewhere they can go to get their paper money.

We are working on changing the password criteria to allow for longer passwords, as well as the use of special characters. I was unable to get a completion date for the changes. In the mean time, Schwab offers an additional layer of security using token authentication for electronic products, such as the Schwab Web site (www.schwab.com).\n\nA Schwab Security Token displays a randomly generated 6-digit passcode that is used in combination with your regular web password.  This extra layer of online security may be desirable if you are a frequent traveler or prefer the extra measure of protection for your account information.  For more details on this service, see the SchwabSafe link at the very bottom of your Schwab.com page.  Select the "How you can prevent unauthorized account access" link in the center, then scroll down to find the Security Token information.\n\nTo order a token at no charge, you can call Technical Support at 1-800-433-9196.  Or call our 24 hour line at 1-800-435-4000. \n\nPlease note: Once you begin using a Security Token, you will need to use the device for every log in.  If you need access without the device, you may call Technical Support at the above number to ask for a temporary passcode.  Token authentication applies only to an individual login, so each account holder will need to make a separate request in order to set up Security Token use.\n\nAlso, Schwab offers a Security Guarantee. This is our promise to cover 100% of any losses in your Schwab accounts due to unauthorized activity. Details about the guarantee are available at www.schwab.com/guarantee. Protection of our clients\' security has always been a top priority of ours, and it has always been our practice to make clients whole in cases of unauthorized account activity. Schwab\'s Security Guarantee is our commitment to protecting the privacy and security of your accounts.\n\nIf you have additional questions, please feel free to reply to this email.

I know that writing a concise introduction to Bitcoin is no easy task, so I hope you don\'t take offense. My own writing always benefits from feedback, and I hope some of this helps you.  \n\nINTRO BOXES  \n\n* RE: first intro. box. You write that "Bitcoin ... does not function within the constraints of traditional banks, governmments, or third party corporations"; this seems to imply that no laws pertaining to Bitcoin exist or will exist. Instead, you could write something like the following: "Bitcoin enables secure payments and a predictable\nmoney supply without the need for a \ntrusted third party such as a bank, company, or government."  \n\n* RE: third intro. box.  Bitcoin revolutionizes the way the world views communication? You might focus on finance alone, explaining that by providing a global, open platform, Bitcoin could be to finance what the Internet is to communication.     \n\nGLOSSARY  \nYou mention miners without explanation. It\'d help to have a separate entry for the term "miner." Perhaps mention that "miners" are specialized computers all over the world that verify transactions, and that for doing so, they\'re rewarded by the software with newly minted or "mined" bitcoins at a set rate; this is how the currency is issued. "Miner" also refers to those who own the computers.  \n\nWHY BITCOIN?  \n\n* RE: bullet point 4. IMO "fraud is next to impossible" is too general. Scams have been implemented on a large scale (Mt. Gox being the most notable example; whether Gox\'s collapse was due more to fraud or incompetence is probably not a worthwhile distinction in this context).  \n\nAlso, people\'s coins do get stolen, and it\'s currently quite difficult to implement a robust system that secures them against both theft and loss. I believe experts such as Andreas Antonopoulos and perhaps Gavin Andresen have acknowledged this. Also, consider the regular posts in r/bitcoin of people\'s coins getting stolen or lost, including those who use paper wallets, etc.  \n\nInstead, you might consider including the following:    \n\n*Bitcoin is kind of like e-mail. You don\'t need to give your\npassword away to send an e-mail, and you don\'t need to give your private key to send a bitcoin payment. With credit cards, you give merchants access to your account (via your card number) in order to submit a single payment, and then those merchants get hacked.*    \n\n* RE: bullet point 5. I don\'t think this is what you had in mind, but perhaps it\'s not totally fair to say Bitcoin is clean, at least not without mentioning the ways in which it is not clean. Proof of work does necessitate rather large amounts of energy consumption, and that energy need not be clean. The fact that this energy is used to secure the system is perhaps too nuanced for a brief introduction. \n\n* You might replace the cleanliness bullet point with *financial access for the unbanked* (that is arguably the biggest advantage of all).  \n\n* RE: bullet point 6. You might replace the wedding example with a more useful application that beginners will immediately understand, such as notary services.  \n\n* You could mention that Bitcoin could be a solution to high inflation. If Bitcoin is successful in the long-run, then an increase in its use could lead to a significant increase in its value, due to the limited supply. Such a store of value would be beneficial to those who live in countries with a highly inflationary currency. (If Bitcoin fails, due to lack of adoption for example, the value could go to zero.)    \n\n* You might add that, like the internet, anyone can develop applications that make use of Bitcoin. This is a really key feature.  \n\n* You might add a bullet point for new business models (e.g. imagine paying a few cents to read an article online instead of a monthly subscription; this was previously impossible since the merchant would pay more in transaction fees than they would earn; the Chicago Sun-Times has already experimented with this).  \n\n6 WAYS TO ACQUIRE...  \n\n* RE: bullet point 1. "Online accounts far less secure..." I know this is a common sentiment, but currently, this depends greatly on the user. Those with limited knowledge of security practices might well be better off using something like Coinbase\'s vault feature than attempting to secure their own coins.  \n\n* RE: bullet point 4. You could specify both goods and services, as opposed to just "stuff." (nitpick)     \n\n* RE: bullet point 6. You might include YouTube in the list of platforms you can use w/ ChangeTip. To me, this is perhaps the best current application. I\'d rather tip someone who has made a carefully produced video than someone who has tweeted 140 characters.  \n\nHOW TO USE BITCOIN  \nIMO, it\'s not feasible to explain how to securely store Bitcoin in a beginner\'s introduction. It\'ll get easier with time, but we\'re not there yet.  \n\nYou might consider mentioning a reputable third party such as Coinbase, which is backed by the NYSE, or Bitpay as a place to get started with a small investment.  \n\nYou could add a disclaimer that the benefits of being an early adopter are balanced by the risk of using a new financial technology, and that investment in any form carries risk.   \n\nYou could then mention that it\'s also possible to store your bitcoins without a third party, but that you have to be careful to store your keys securely. Developers will make this more user friendly in time (just as they made it easier to send e-mail, which used to be hard). For those who are interested, you could then include links to more advanced references on secure storage methods.  \n\nI know that many early adopters see the ability to store their own wealth as a big advantage, but it\'s just not that easy to do yet for the average user.\n\nORGANIZATION  \nYou might split your "How to Use Bitcoin" section into two sections. After the "How" section, you could have a "Where to Use Bitcoin Section."  \n\nIn the "Where" section, as long as you\'re listing merchants who accept Bitcoin, you might as well add a few more of the big names (see below).   \n\nYou can explain that it\'s easy for merchants to accept Bitcoin without subjecting themselves to volatility, by instantly cashing out through services such as Coinbase (used by over 38,000 businesses, including Overstock, Dish Network, Dell, Expedia, and Time Inc.) or Bitpay (used by over 50,000 businesses and organizations including Microsoft and Tiger Direct).  \n\nHISTORY  \nYou could add...  \n\n* Coinbase as first major U.S. exchange \n($106 million total funding, backers include NYSE); \n* Gox collapse is surely a big moment in Bitcoin\'s early history\n* Bitcoin ruled to be property by IRS (more important\nthan Texas judge ruling?)   \n* auctions of silk road coins by U.S. Marshals\n\nTYPOGRAPHICAL ISSUES  \n\n* first box: techonology (typo)\n* under "6 ways to acquire", no comma after "few ways to get your hands on this currency"  \n* ChangeTip (no space) \n* give away (need a space because you\'re using this as a verb, not a noun)  \n* history chart: "led", not lead (past tense) \n* the word "pseudonym" not used correctly (a pseudonym is an identifier, not the person it identifies) \n* typo in *jacsonville, florida"  \n* You might consider distinguishing Bitcoin (capital B) from bitcoin (lowercase b); the former can be used for the network/protocol and the latter can be used for the currency. This isn\'t completely standard yet, but it\'s common and emphasizes that bitcoin is more than just a currency.  \n\nEdit: formatting': 1, 'Bookmarked, this is a good starting point.

But yet we are not starving. The people in Rhodesia were not starving either, when the white people moved in, bought land and ran farms there; indeed it was known as ["the bread-basket of Africa"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadbasket#Zimbabwe). The reason why it was the bread-basket of Africa, was because the white government there at the time protected property rights, which lead foreign people to invest in the country, to buy land and to build up enterprises such as productive farms on it, as they were confident that someone was not going to take it from them after they had cultivated it; and also because no one did take it from them in the middle of their cultivating it. The white farmers employed the Africans on their farms, and the Africans benefited from the wealth created there. When the white government was replaced by an African government, and the country was renamed to "Zimbabwe", the African government set its \'war veterans\' to go and seize the white-owned farms, but rather than taking them over and running them, they burnt them down. Now the people there are poor and starving again.': 0, 'I totally agree. Bitcoin is not bad. I don\'t think it\'s bad, and Bill Gates doesn\'t think it\'s bad. His actual comment from the AMA was this:\n\n>Making sure that it doesn\'t help terrorists is a challenge for all new technology.\n\nWhich is very close to what you just said. All things that are useful will also be useful for "bad guys" who want to do bad things. But certain things seem extra useful for bad stuff compared with their use to the general public. \n\nPersonally I\'m a big fan of bitcoin, but I totally see why law-makers would look at a system that let\'s people easily send money without identifying themselves, and instantly focus on all the bad stuff that enables. The argument that that bad stuff already happens doesn\'t change the fact that bitcoin will make it all easier.': 1, 'I see': 7, "Yes, he is giving his wealth away, all of it, and more than that he devoted his time for that... what did you do that can count to change the lives of these poor souls ? you asshole low life...\n\n\nyes, there are people who aren't as greedy as you, and they care about other human beings, not only about their investments.": 8, "The presence of his vaccination program allows for more doctors to diagnose for disease.

He's obviously buying!": 6, "But it is important even in frictionless transfer, because people will mainly want the thing that other people want the most. Money is an all or nothing process. There have been multiple forms of money in the past for reasons, but in an interconnected digital world, there is no reason to have multiple forms, and the push will be towards a single form, just from sort of evolutionary pressures. People most want the form of money that other people want the most. That's the main reason why. \n\nAnd there is nothing un-decentralized about having a single network. It is not anti- the spirit of bitcoin. Like I said, I think the analogy of the Internet is accurate. We can have one single network that is completely decentralized. One network is efficient because then there is no friction and no barrier. The Internet can become even more decentralized (mesh networks, etc.), and yet still be a single network, all running on the same root and the same protocol of TCP/IP. So too, there is no reason why there is any problem, and there are many good reasons, to have a single network of value transfer.\n\nAnother equally important reason is the way blockchain security works. Two blockchains are much less secure than one blockchain of equal hashing power to both combined. If we have many blockchains they will all be less secure. That's why if we need a new coin or digital asset that requires a blockchain, it will probably be as a sidechain in the future. Therefore I maintain we will see one main base layer of value transfer (main blockchain) and everything else will be layers on top of it (like we have with the modern Internet). There will also be sidechains.\n\nAnd yes, friction between networks is an issue. There is financial friction just in trading, even in very efficient digital markets. This, while not the main issue, will also be a subtle but significant evolutionary push towards a single chain.\n": 1, "Africans can't access food because they can't access land without paying rent on it or being a day laborer on someone else's.

How would you get your wealth out of the country or keep it in country but keep it safe?\n\nWe have parallels.

They are only a few decades older than Bitcoin, which is not very long in money terms. Look how much trouble credit cards are in already. They are a failed experiment that Central Banks just keep pouring money into.\n\nBefore credit cards, people saved money. They used escrow and down-payments to secure contracts. There was a BBB. Local banks loaned money for homes and small businesses. People deposited their money in banks and were paid compound interest.\n\nThe old ways worked for hundreds of years.

I think one of the things that will help drive consumer acceptance of bitcoin will be an app that helps highlight this mark up. I don't, however, believe goods will ever be priced in bitcoin.\n\nOne way I see this mark up being exposed is through some sort of instant bitcoin back program. I pay for an item in bitcoin at some USD amount but received bitcoin back because I saved the merchant money and they're passing *some* savings onto me.

Don\'t you realize that?\n\n>> And if they would control over 50% of the bitcoin nodes they could even actually "inject" transactions which never happened\n> What do you mean?\n\nThe bitcoin system has this little "flaw" of being vulnerable if you control 50% of the transaction approving nodes. You should read about your beloved technology.\n\n> What? Who is \'we\'? Are you seriously suggesting that we have transparency over our transactional system today? Are you trolling?\n\nWell these days money cant just flow from A to B without someone knowing, there is no full transparency but there is also not much possibility to hide a lot (and use it later to gain power). And again: Bitcoin wouldn\'t change that 1 bit..... People who want to hide can still hide, they can even much better hide as they can use digital technology to spread the money even over more accounts and activities and you as someone using the transparency to see whats going on, will still know nothing.......\n\n> Also Bitcoin has 100 other features than transparency.\n\nWhich of those problems solve the problem of how cash _FLOWS_...... Bitcoin is just another way of define a currency, a technical tight one, which doesnt change anything, in Germany Bitcoin is already taxed, i can\'t take in money from Bitcoin without registering with my country, else I am doing a Fraud, which is logical, cause we have the tax concept and I just cant illegal evade it, the concept can\'t change, or you say taxes and government is evil and we should go anarchistic, then bitcoin would be ACTUALLY useful... ONLY THEN... but trust me, then people will torture you to get your bitcoin wallet password and noone is there to care.\n\nOr to make it more simple: There will be still someone giving you a credit and he still wants 5% from you, and _THIS_ is the core problem of the cashflow we have these days, as those 5% doesnt exist, and so the banks have money that doesnt exist (Read up about money really..... 99.99999% of people who know bitcoin have actually no idea what MONEY really means). So if bitcoin is not changing that (and there is nothing of bitcoin actually caring about this, bitcoin is just the coin, why the coin should care about how it is "parsed and used"?) then you will not really change anything of the problem....\n\nUnderstanding what the problem with the cashflow really is, is the key to understand how to solve it.

You understand that Bitcoin is still in its infancy, and that commercial development is only starting to pick up steam, right? Venture capital investment in 2014 totaled about $500 million USD, and for 2015 it\'s on track to be around $1 billion USD. The fruits of these investments may not start to appear for another year or two at least. Major financial organizations such as [MasterCard](http://redd.it/2zt8hq) and [Credit-Suisse](http://redd.it/2zt8hq) (among many others) are starting to take serious notice. Regarding being an acronym on NASDAQ, one entity, the [Bitcoin Investment Trust (symbol GBTC)](http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/gbtc) is already listed (though not on NASDAQ) and is poised to start trading OTC any day now. Several others should be following on soon.  \n\nRecently, it\'s become quite trendy in business and the media to praise the block chain, the technology pioneered by Bitcoin and that underpins it, while dismissing bitcoin as a currency. The proof-of-work backed block chain is truly a revolutionary innovation that represents the first time in history a consensus can be achieved across a fully open network where no trust must be vested in any network member. However, the position that you can embrace the block chain as a platform for innovation and dismiss the value token that is inherent in its function is a fallacy based on either a basic misunderstanding of Bitcoin\'s core technology, or on the presumption that some dramatically superior system is just around the corner (which hypothetically would not require a value token at all). The problem is while such an upcoming development cannot be said to be impossible, its emergence hardly seems imminent. In addition, should any such developments arise, Bitcoin is software that can adopt innovations into its protocol. As its existing network already stands as the largest, most secure, and most highly capitalized digital currency by far, keeping up with obviously beneficial changes will be strongly motivated by those already supporting or invested in Bitcoin.\n\nThe final thing I\'ll bring up might be the first thing most in the general public notice about Bitcoin: do you still own any of the coins you bought at $1 or $20? If so, their current value would seem to be a good recommendation on Bitcoin as an investment (and if not, I\'m sure you\'re kicking yourself a bit on what you missed out on so far). If Bitcoin grows and succeeds, it\'s valuation should continuing increasing the way it has for most of its short six-year life for some time to come (in overall direction at least, if not in the explosiveness of its past, virtually exponential growth). There are so many areas in which Bitcoin shows potential that I feel if it achieves even a small fraction of its promise in just some of these areas its valuation has tremendous room for growth. It must be acknowledged that the price has fallen severely over the last 15 months after the most recent spike, but this doesn\'t even represent its sharpest decline nor the longest down period of its six-year existence. There still has never been a time span during which you could buy bitcoin at the worst possible moment and *lose* value if you held for more than 19 months. Still, since its entire history is so short, this is hardly a guarantee these trends will continue (and past history never assures future returns). But just maybe the current valuation represents a good buying opportunity (disclaimer: bitcoin must be a considered a high risk investment). Be aware, also, that I suspect it\'s volatile and spiky valuation patterns will continue for some time as well. If precipitous drops after huge price spikes make you nauseous, be prepared to lock your valuation (via services like Coinapult Locks or Bitreserve), utilize short positions, or exit Bitcoin temporarily if another steep run up occurs. Timing could be tricky, though, and the old Bitcoin "HODL" strategy may prove more foolproof in the long run (or at least until Bitcoin matures, after which volatility and explosive growth will likely no longer be the considerations they are now).': 1, "Bitcoin is financial freedom.

I bought 2000.00 usd at 17.74 a coin. 10 days later or so btc price was less than  1.00 usd. I at that moment had really little choice because what return would I get out of these coins, however I did think about it, but luckily I did not need the money and I have pursued a fantastic life to this point. Most or about 63% of my portfolio stands mainly with btc and add about 7 % we will loosely say is holdings in mainly 2 other coins.

I believe these are the group that must be isolated and push away from this great thing we have. Take this thought for example, and let me dissolve the huge importance the general public has on our success or failure. But this is how I see things and how Nakamoto's group quite possibly for seen the future too. With the core wallet of Nakamoto having the ability to sink this ship, I truly believe that they have given us such a great future with this amazing development they handed over to us. I must pause cause some may take this out of context, I am in no way relating the core group known to most as Nakamoto to a divine figure as I proceed. that said, back on point, they literally handed this great and powerful achievement to us to basically do as we wish with it. If it helps the world as I believe they intended and watch the world come together and start to achieve and see the greatness we were given. I believe they will continue to allow us to flourish and assist us along the way and grow further TOGETHER. \nNow for the bad part of what I believe was also part of there plan. With all these negative results and negative impact we read about almost every single day anymore. Once we have destroyed, or sorry have sunk bitcoin and the positive vision it was developed for to the point of no return. This too is where I see the group without a doubt saying enough is enough. This is when they come out and absolutely flood the market and take the very thing they gave us away, and believe me when I say this, it will be taken from us quicker that it was Given to us. \nI really want to expand on the integration inot the general public, but I feel I've taken to much time.

Why is ability to touch a unit of money important to you?  People tend to get confused about money because they see currency as a unit that has value--this is the wrong way to model money.  A better way would be to look currency as a ledger for keeping track of things.  In primitive societies people did this by remembering the favors they did for the fellow members of their tribes.  You couldn\'t see or touch these favors, but they were very real and they were the first currency.\n\n* Precious metals have held a value through all of recorded history, even in many isolated cultures. They\'ve withstood the test of time, while cryptocurrencies are new and untested.\n\n**The argument here is that things have always been a certain way, therefore they will continue to be that way.  This is utterly absurd.  What the fuck does "test of time" mean anyway?  It isn\'t time that does anything to a currency but rather market conditions & competition that occur over time, but up until 6 years ago Bitcoin did not exist and it did not face this competitive threat.  Gold may have survived the *test of time* in the past, but I\'m damn sure it won\'t survive the test of Bitcoin. \n\n*Precious metals are actually scarce. You can\'t just create an exact clone of gold out of thin air and start mining it. And even if the entire world came to a consensus that the amount of gold that exists isn\'t enough, they could not increase the amount.\n\n** They can and do create gold out of thin air in the form of fiduciary media.  Gold, being physical, cannot be moved around quickly which necessitates the market to create digital representations of gold, which are duplicated.  Incidentally if the gold price does get high enough it actually cann be pulled out of thin...water, in that it can be harvested from the ocean, or space via asteroid mining.  If the price gets high enough you can create it by fusion or just building a star...but Bitcoin??  You can\'t create more of that...\n\n*Precious metals don\'t rely on network effect to retain value. You can\'t make a copy of gold with the same properties and call it something else.\n\n** The only reason gold has (monetary) value is because people are willing to accept it as payment and horde it--this is a directly result of the network effect, such is always the case with any currency\n\n\n\n': 2, 'I need to look into it.

This effort has failed because it is impossible to compete against a digital currency, like the dollar, with a physical commodity due to the high transaction costs associated with the latter. The only way metals can succeed is if fiat fails.
