Getting back to your question:\n\nLightning nodes are not custodians. When you build a payment channel you and the counterparty put coins into a 2-of-2 multisig contract. Spends require both of your signatures, so it is absolutely impossible for the other party to take your funds without your permission.\n\nLightning payments involve constructing spend transactions which settle the net balance for the channel, and then replacing these transactions for each payment. Each replacement must be signed by both parties before it can be broadcast to the Bitcoin network.\n\nSo there aren\'t any IOUs involved, and your signature is required to spend your coins.

When there are people working both on Core and for Blockstream, and the Blockstream business model depends on the bitcoin blockchain being unable to handle a large volume of transactions, he would be hard-pressed to convince people that these players have some OTHER reason to cripple bitcoin.  \n\n> But as I mentioned, he didn\'t take either of those approaches.  Let\'s look at the points one at a time.\n\n> **It\'s not just Blockstream employees who prefer to keep the blocks small.**\nThis is probably true, but it seems to me to be fantastically irrelevant.  Yes, there are people who do not work for Blockstream who want to keep blocks small.  I would imagine that any person who 1) understands the situation and 2) wants bitcoin to fail would likely fall into this category (that doesn\'t mean all small-blockers want bitcoin to fail - read carefully).  How does that counter the myth?  Is it not possible for both of these hypothetical people to exist:\n\n> * Person A - Core developer, Blockstream employee, wants to keep bitcoin block sizes small so that LN is necessary\n\n> * Person B - average joe, wants to keep block sizes small\n\n> Even if Person B was a bitcoin super-guru who had lots of excellent reasons for keeping the blocksize small, the fact that person B exists doesn\'t mean that person A does not exist.\n\n\n> **Some of the most prominent Blockstream employees and Core developers opposing a block-size increase were skeptical of raising this limit long before Blockstream was founded.**\nAgain true, but again irrelevant.  Just because these people wanted to keep the block sizes small before they had a financial incentive to want to keep them small doesn\'t mean that the financial incentive they have NOW isn\'t driving their current desire to keep the blocksize small.  That doesn\'t mean that it IS what is driving their current desire; I\'m simply pointing out that this argument makes no progress in "debunking" the "myth."\n\n\n> **Even if transaction fees on the Bitcoin network do rise, that doesn\'t really "force" people onto the Lightning Network at all.**\nThis is a straw-man fallacy.  His argument hinges on the use of the strong "force" in the wording of the myth, as if the people on the other side were saying that high bitcoin processing fees would inexorably compel people onto the lightning network against their will.  But that is not the position of the large-blockers (which is what makes it a straw-man).  A carefully enunciated objection from a large-blocker would not use the word "force" or any other verb that suggested the end-user had no choice in the matter.  We **know** that there are "plenty of alternative solutions with which to transfer money" and we know that they all suck; that\'s why we use Bitcoin in the first place!  We are watching a group of people who, as far as we can tell, are actively trying to destroy a revolutionary and near-free system to transfer money so they can put their own not-free system in its place to make money for themselves!\n\n> **The case for smaller blocks is simply much more reasonable than the "force-bitcoiners-to-use-Lightning" argument would have you believe.**\nMaybe that is the case.  Maybe there are super-stupendous reasons for keeping the blocks small that have nothing to do with the lightning network.  How does that debunk the belief that at least one of the reasons why the core developers are doing this is so that there is a market for the lightning network?\n\n> I am saying: He wants to steal the cake so he can eat it.\nHe is saying: No he wants to steal the cake so he can have it.  You should not worry that he is stealing the cake since his reasons for stealing it are different than you think they are.\n\n\n> I\'m afraid I haven\'t read the rest of the myths.  I assume they are just as nonsensical as this one.  Of course I could be wrong, so I\'ll keep an eye out here in case somebody posts a good reason to go back!  ': 15, "Consider an analogy to chequeing and savings accounts:\n\nYour hard bitcoin (stored on-chain) is like a savings account.  The bitcoin you commit to a payment channel would be like a chequeing account.  There's flexibility to setup payment channels with anyone you want, but (because of the fact that bitcoin is locked into the payment channel for the life of the channel) it's more practical to have only a couple channels (chequeing accounts) with a couple hubs.\n\nThis friend that you might send one or two payments two (and thus have little incentive to setup a payment channel with directly) can be paid through your existing 'chequeing account' payment channel by the routing capability of the LN.

How much the fees will be in the future is impossible to guess though.\n\nI think the Lightning Network (or other hub-and-spoke micropayment channel networks) have a lot of advantages and will be a great asset, but I don't think that they'll take a catastrophic amount of transaction volume off the chain.\n\nCan't be sure though, only time will tell.": 3, "Fact 1: Lightning networks still don't exist for a good reason.": -4, '> and maybe they will\n\nExactly.

There is no way you'd ever see this only a few times a year.": 4, "From what I understand, Lightning Network when completed in either hub-and-spoke or truly decentralized form, should be a useful extension layer on top of Bitcoin. However, the entire premise of this article seems flawed to me for the simple reason that Lightning Network does not yet exist in a finalized form (not even in beta). Even Lightning developers can't assert with absolute certainty what the final attributes of the production product will be, so how can any outside observer know what will actually be fact or myth?  \n\nThe best that can be determined now is project intent, and even that seems to have migrated from initially being available via a hub-and-spoke model to now including decentralized routing as an integral (?) part of LN. Who can say if project intent will migrate further before a finished product is delivered?  \n\ne: grammar clean-up": 2, 'Correction to u/AaronVanWirdum: pedantically, BIP 62 is not required for lightning, although it is required in order to have a quality user experience. Also, "Lightning" usually refers to schemes involving relative time-lock, e.g. BIPs 68 & 112, not absolute time-lock (BIP 65).\n\nBIP 65: enables traditional payment channels with trustless setup. This is sufficient for pseudo-Lightning with baked-in channel expiration and locked funds, which would be a suboptimal user experience as the counterparty to a channel could hold funds hostage, even if for a limited period of time, and fee would need to be paid to renew a channel at periodic intervals.\n\nBIP 68 + BIP 112: full-on Lightning is possible, using hash-locked contracts instead of malleability fixes. This approach does not suffer from the tradeoff between availability of funds and channel duration. Channels can be kept open indefinitely, yet close quickly even if the counter-party is unresponsive. The downside is it requires having your node online 24/7, or at least checking in more frequently the duration of the close-out, and being able to respond quickly. This service cannot be outsourced without giving up full control of your funds. It\'s an annoying, although perhaps not unsolvable limitation.\n\nBIPs 68, 112, plus one of BIP 62, segregated witness, or other such malleability fix: removes the requirement that the user be online 24/7. The malleability fix ensures that you can instead pre-sign dependent transactions and then outsource the responsibility of broadcasting them to one or more third parties, for a fee. Should the counterparty try to cheat while you are offline, the untrusted third party will intervene on your behalf without taking any more than the fee allocated to them for doing so.': 27, 'Hubs function like routers: they form a web of payment channels.

Similar to an email money transfer today -- you already have funds committed to bank X, your friend has funds committed to bank Y (i.e. two payment channels with two different hubs).  When you email your friend money, you're actually asking bank X to authorize the transfer of money to bank Y (i.e. send the money between over the inter-bank payment channel).\n\n> no one believes Bitcoin survives if a transaction cost \xc2\xa3$\xe2\x82\xac 5--10...do they?\n\nWhy couldn't it?

Can the tech (blockchain) stand without the currency (bitcoin)? ': 22, '> Thank you. So one can imagine a future in which the banking system has its own blockchain. Correct? \n\ntl;dr: Yes, but it has some drawbacks.\n\nThe banking system *already* has private funds transfer systems: clearinghouses and SWIFT.  But they are slow and outdated.  For example, US domestic clearinghouses can take up to three days to settle an ACH transfer (ACH means automated clearing house).  [SWIFT](https://www.quora.com/How-long-should-international-bank-transfers-take-by-SWIFT), which is mostly for international transfers, takes 2-5 days if no special problems crop up.\n\nA blockchain system works differently.  All the bitcoins in existence reside in the blockchain.  They never leave it, but merely change which address, and therefore which private key, can make the next transaction.  A change in ownership of bitcoins is immediately visible to everyone, and irreversible by mining in about an hour.  \n\nThat would be faster and cheaper not just for banks, but for their customers.  The downside to a private chain is less hashing power to keep it secure, and the possibility of reversals if the member banks agree to discard a transaction and redo the chain.  They can do that if they are the only ones mining.  Distributed mining makes reversals infeasible because no single entity has enough power to redo the chain faster than everyone else just keeps adding to it.': 5, '5 YEARS? LOL...

If the service charges no fees directly, money will be made elsewhere - indirectly. Perhaps selling customer information. Perhaps risky leveraging of customer deposits. Maybe complicated exchange rate engineering. One way or another, Minor and Co. will try to collect a fee. And when the plan blows up due to factors "nobody could have predicted," it will be Uphold\'s customers who lose.\n\nSecond, one of the main criticisms of Bitcoin comes from well-off Westerners who see no need for P2P, cross-border transactions given the availability of banks, PayPal, and VISA.

However, a user does not gain a significant advantage by doing so. As we have seen above, paying only the current leader increases the direct motivation of the current leader to place the transaction in a microblock, but reduces the motivation of future miners to mine on this microblock. Moreover, if the leader does not include the transaction before the end of its epoch, subsequent leaders will have no motivation to place\nthe transaction.\n>\n> Other motives for fee manipulation such as paying a large fee to encourage miners to choose a certain branch after a fork apply to Bitcoin as well as Bitcoin-NG, and are outside the scope of this work.": 2, "Thank you for separating the signal from the noise.\n\n>If you stand to gain more than the block reward by cheating, you can do so and benefit. \n\nOnly when someone is accepting transactions in a microblock whose value exceeds the block reward. Don't do that. Microblocks are much better than 0-conf transactions, but they are not foolproof.

I cannot imagine a new coin *not* using something like this to increase throughput.\n': 1, "Here he addresses a situation where a user pays fees to the current leader (although I don't know whether his argument is convincing for that case, either). \n\nThe vector I was referring to, however, is when a user's wallet pays their fee to an OP_TRUE script. This is different because it actually offers an incentive to both the current miner and the next leader and pits them against each other.\n\nSo if I pay my fee to a script redeemable by anyone, the current leader will certainly publish a micro-block including a tx which pays that output to himself. Others on the network might try to spend it, but the leader won't include those transactions in his blocks. So far, this is the same as the case in the above quote.\n\nExcept miners can choose which micro-blocks to confirm in their leader block. This leads to a cost-benefit analysis each time a micro-block is published. If there exist enough OP_TRUE fees in some subset of 'unconfirmed' micro-blocks to offset the genuine fees the leader would receive by confirmed the block, he will mine on top of the micro-block prior to that subset, and after he authors the new key block and becomes the new leader, he will author new micro-blocks that spend said OP_TRUE fees to himself.\n\nNow, it's possible that this would lead to a recursive problem where miners only mine key blocks because they are eternally fighting over an increasingly-large set of up-for-grabs fees. Transactions are never confirmed, and the network dies. With this outlook, it may be true that users are not incentivized to pay to OP_TRUE instead of paying a fee normally, but malicious actor who wants to see bitcoin fail is certainly incentivized to instigate this miner-brawl with some valuable OP_TRUE outputs.\n\nDisclaimer: Of course, this is conjecture on my part, and I deal with wallet code more often than consensus code. /shrug": 2, 'Can you please summarize the concern(s)?

It is not very secure against centralization, the only cure for which would be to switch to a "less proven algorithm" in case a mining cartel is proven to censor transactions. At present Ethereum runs on SHA3 and has an army of GPU miners on it. Before centralization happens they intend to switch to a variant of PoS (in about 9-10 months). Even straight forward PoS provides ECDSA backed security which needs a signature or set of signatures from an account holding the token. Even with only one ECDSA signature, the entire bitcoin network would never be able to resign that block without the original key, since there is only one target value and not a set of target values as with PoW double round SHA256 threshold targeting. PoS has been said to hold risks like nothing at stake, which the Ethereum PoS scheme addresses by insisting on a bond from the staker. However, since PeerCoin has been running for years and is still unhacked, this attack too remains theoretical. \n\nSecondly, Rootstock is an **awesome** idea. Really, it\'s almost inspired. Unfortunately they have not yet submitted a feasible 2-way peg. I\'m not saying they don\'t have one, but I\'ve asked a bunch of times and they have mostly been hinting at a n-of-m multisig entry and exit wallet. Those are limited to x-of-7 uncompressed addresses and x-of-15 compressed addresses. They say they "just want a workable system" to start with. Ethereum is currently at about 36 million USD. Even if RootStock\'s token was backed by the more widely accepted bitcoin, it will not grow to that level if it\'s entire backing could be compromised by manipulating less than 15 key holders. \n\nThirdly, there are a great many awesome projects in this space that never got off the ground. Ethereum, for all the hate spat at it, is not one of those, its token may fail but its underlying concepts and the functionality is allows is so important that a whole team of people is willing to run a project to try and allow the same functionality that is working on Ethereum **today** on Bitcoin based tokens.

Im curious how you extrapolate such insider knowledge from 2 systems, one that you can possibly know nothing about. Hard to catch up? They are launching in 6-9 months. They are pretty much on the same pace. Ethereum has been vaporware for a couple years, and rootstock has been being built quietly for 2 years. There's very little difference.\n\nAs for your opinion on the project, I think you are being very unrealistic. It seems to me that it is *you* who is desperately holding to this idea that etherum is going to be 'king of the castle'.\n\nThe entire premise of your opinion is defeated by one simple fact: Bitcoin is orders of magnitude larger and more secure than etherum. Ethereum could run for the next 5 years and it would still in no way compete with the hashing power that bitcoin has generated. While rootstock gets to jump right into the network with merged mining. I think it will not just take off, it will *fly* forward way past etherum.

Big reveal in Mexico. Jargon, jargon, jargon.': -1, '> Why would you think a switch to POS would increase network hash rate? Changing your algo will decrease hash rate, not increase?\n\nThe cost of compromising the Bitcoin network (or any other POW network, really) can be considered to be identical to the cost of bribing some combination of pool operators who collectively control 51% of the network\'s hashrate. Assuming that pool operators are rational actors, this figure is likely less than the cost of actually obtaining the necessary hardware oneself. If we assume pool operators are rational actors, that the average pool fee (weighted by hashrate) is 1%, and that the average pool operator has a 10 year outlook, it\'d cost $7,589,461.15 to bribe enough pool operators to get 51% of the network\'s hashrate. That\'s 51% of ten years worth of earnings from taking a 1% cut of the blocks produced by the whole network, given the current exchange rate.\n\nThe cost of compromising a POS system is derived from its staking participation rate. You\'d need 51% of the currently staking deposits to compromise the system. At ether\'s current price, you\'d need a staking participation rate of 18.5% to match Bitcoin\'s security. This seems fairly reasonable. And if the value of ether rises, the participation rate can drop and still maintain the same level of security.\n\n**Edit:** Also, POS isn\'t a hashing algorithm. It\'s a method of securing a blockchain such that any full node on the network can also be a "staker." That\'s a much larger set of people than can be miners in POW schemes.': 3, "Why would you think a switch to POS would increase network hash rate?
