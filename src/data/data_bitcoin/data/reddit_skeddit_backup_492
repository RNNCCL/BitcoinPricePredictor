So less open-ended than fiat money creation.\n\nBitcoin is a different beast entirely. We *know* there will eventually be 21M bitcoin.

Many people (almost everyone it seems) are keen to point out they believe the efficient market hypothesis is wrong, but it\'s a base case that one should consider; I see it as much like natural selection - given only very trivial assumptions it is close to a logical necessity.

Certain objects are simply *more likely* to be regarded as such, due to a range of properties (i.e. scarcity, fungibility, being able to settle debt with it, among others).\n\nThe value of **everything** depends on context and is heavily situational. ': 3, "I would review the properties of gold that have made it a preferred store of value for centuries:  scarcity, divisibility, fungibility, portability, cost of storage,  resistance to counterfeiting, etc.  Then I'd discuss how bitcoin equals or exceeds gold in these areas.  \n\nRegarding the issue of scarcity, your article actually shortchanges bitcoin relative to gold.  Although there is a finite amount of gold in the world, we cannot predict with certainty how much will be mined each year.  We cannot predict what new technologies may enable the mining of gold from previously uneconomical or untapped sources.  There is also the possibility that we could someday mine gold from extra-terrestrial sources or that gold-laden meteors could shower the earth.\n\nYou also shortchange bitcoin on the issue of intrinsic value (other than its value as money).   I would observe that the industrial demand for gold is dwarfed by investment demand and the price of gold primarily reflects it's use as a store of value.  It can be argued that bitcoin has greater intrinsic value than gold due to its connection to an underlying technology that has many potential uses.\n\t\nIn the interest of honesty, I would also mention the ways in which bitcoin is inferior to gold.  Unlike gold, bitcoin depends on a network of computer hardware and software which may be susceptible to attack, failure, or replacement by superior technology.  Bitcoin's limited acceptance (compared to gold) and its association with illegal activity also make it more susceptible to government repression.   In addition, bitcoin is confusing and intimidating to most people...and not without reason.

Both bitcoin and gold derive their primary value from their nature that make them useful as a monetary instrument to account, store, and transfer value.  \n- Bitcoin is a new type of monetary asset and has some advantages over gold.  It cannot be counterfeit and is trivial to validate compared to gold.  It is easier, quicker, and cheaper to transfer and divide compared to gold.  It\'s easier and cheaper to secure than gold (presuming you know how to secure it properly).  Unlike gold it\'s digital and exists everywhere so as a result you have access to it (or it "goes with you") no matter where you go or how much you own.\n- The value for both bitcoin and gold is arbitrary in that it reflects the size of the market that trusts the asset and holds value in it vs the amount of asset available.  Both gold and bitcoin have a restricted amount available.

Do you want ultimate security or do you want easy access with moderate security?\n\nHonestly my recommendation is creating many denominations of paper wallets.

If done properly the only way for someone else to access your bitcoin is if you divulge the decryption keys.\n\nYou have a lot to secure, you should plan a full weekend for this task, but you will feel safe and understand how to secure your coins in the future.\n\nFirst consider denomination sizes for paper wallets.

Then you have safety of offline frozen storage received addresses for your availability.\n\nBut if using transacting for your bitcoins is your goal, perhaps technology of multisig may be the solution for your security. Famous websites as for example BitGo offer service to co-sign transactions for when two factor text message is authenticated to you. In that manner, the hacking of your computer may yet not lose your quantity of bitcoins.\n\nFor best of security in practice, much studying is required.

If you're spending with it often, then just save yourself the headache and get a trezor.  You can have one setup in minutes and can create many different backups on seed (I would recommend making 3-4 seeds for that much money and storing them on different ones if you don't need to spend too much of it and you simply want to secure it, otherwise, I would have to say keep it on one trezor with a backup seed [keep that in your safe deposit box mind you] and spend it when necessary)": 1, 'My personal favourite is offline cold storage using Electrum.
