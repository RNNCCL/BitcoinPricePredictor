Remember, the problem is that both parties have to know that both of them have seen and agreed upon a set time.\n': 1, 'Well, they\'re going to need some computers. And an internet connection. So the analogy has already failed, really.\n\nBut you can encode a message in any block chain transaction. "Attack at dawn". Or whatever.\n\nSince it\'s a public ledger, and you can see that it\'s made it into the network by the number of confirms skyrocketing, you can assume that unless the other army is experiencing technical difficulties, they are seeing exactly the same blockchain that you are. So, it solves the two generals problem... *if* your computer and internet connection is working.\n\nOf course, the enemy can see your plans, too.': 1, "Perhaps. Given his apparent genius, though, I'd like to see him/her/it/them work on improving electronic security as a whole. My thinking is that there has to be a better way than having people try to memorize/write down passwords. People get lazy and use bad passwords, and/or one password for everything. There has to be a better way.\n\nThat would make everything online more secure, bitcoin included.": 2, "Have you heard of bitcoin? That's the solution.": 0, 'The problem is that two parties whose communications are unreliable (or cannot be trusted) cannot easily coordinate their actions. The traditional problem uses an analogy of two armies who are trying to coordinate the timing of an attack while encamped in the field some distance from each other, and whose messengers might be captured by the enemy which occupies the position between them. How do you know the other army received your message? How do you know they didn\'t receive a forged message?\n\nBitcoin had to deal with this problem. In the case of bitcoin, the two parties are the sender and receiver of bitcoin who need to be able to know that the bitcoin (or, a message attached to the bitcoin) has been correctly sent and received *without a trustworthy third party to make that promise*. Under the normal financial system you have banks that quite reliably relay transactions around and are required to do so, by law, in a more or less honest way.\n\nWith bitcoin, the idea was to make it decentralized. You don\'t have a single third party who can make these promises. In fact you have numerous third parties including full nodes and miners. In the analogy to the two generals problem, these numerous third parties can be thought of as everything that lies between the two armies, including the enemy but also including people who will offer to help relay the messages. They can decide to ignore transactions, and some of the bad apples may try to falsify transactions. How do you know you can trust them?\n\nBitcoin\'s solution to the problem is a combination of the public ledger and the majority rules nature of the network. The main effect is that it makes all communications visible to everyone, and greatly reduces the risk of forgeries or tampering of any kind. It would be like if the two armies decided to communicate by hiring an army of emotionless robots to collect their messages, compile them together, and drop them via leaflets from airships. The possibility for tampering with the messages still exists but the more robots you have and the more leaflets you have raining from the sky, the harder it is for somebody to collect them all and revise them all before the intended recipients gets a chance to see them.\n\nWell, that\'s my interpretation anyway.\n\nI can see your point, I mean, TCP/IP had to deal with this too so solving the problem is not a new thing.

This is for both backup and in the case of my death.  I have no kids right now and single, so I am playing the "dead rich uncle" game with my nieces and nephews.\n\nI generated a bunch of addresses offline.  This was on a pretty fresh install of Linux on an old laptop, using a copy of bitaddress.org that I saved to USB.  I used Create Paper Wallet with Hide Artwork.  I made five wallets per page, printed them to PDF file.  I BIP38 encrypted them with pretty long (30-40 characters) somewhat-meaningful strings.  So I now have several sets of wallets, all BIP38 encrypted with different strings.  \n\nIn each set, I use the first address as a tester by sending some mbtc to it, and verified the private key and bip38 password worked.  This wasn\'t so bad because I just scanned the QR code of the private key from the PDF file onto my phone wallet, and entered in the password (I figure even if my phone has a key logger, which is unlikely, they won\'t know the other private keys).  This is just to give me a warm fuzzy that the private key and BIP38 password are good for the sets I created. I sent the bulk of my coins to the other addresses that were generated in each group.  I copied each of the BTC addresses into a text file to move over to my regular computer.  Don\'t care if anyone finds those, they\'re welcome to send me BTC.\n\nI then created on a USB flash drive a bootable instance of Linux with an encrypted HDD (no swap drive).  I changed the background image to [something like this](http://i6.minus.com/iJrGQyPwzLP9I.png), which was mostly done for kicks.  There\'s a single folder on the desktop and inside are those PDF files with the encrypted private wallets.\n\nI shutdown from where I was booted into the encrypted USB flash and then dd copied the whole flash drive onto three other flash drives.  I\'ve hidden these in objects with secret compartments at home and offsite.  \n\nAs a backup practice, every month or two I will verify one of them on a rotating basis by booting into it and ensuring I can view the PDF pages.   In order to gain access to the coins, a person would have to 1) find one of the USB 2) access the encrypted partition 3) have the right BIP38 key for the private keys.  \n\nNow the crazy dead uncle fun part.  \n\nIn my will, I\'ve bequeathed to my nephews/nieces the objects where I have the flash drives hidden.  For instance "To X, I leave you an [unopened can of miller high-life](http://www.diversionsafeshop.com/diversion-can-safes.html).    And to Y, I leave you a ...  And to Z, I leave you ...  May the swiftest and smartest of you all be enriched by these humble belongings of mine."\n\nSo, when I die, they\'ll get what looks like a piece of junk.  If they investigate it, rather than throw it out, they\'ll soon discover it contains a flash drive.  I\'ve left clues for the HDD encryption password and the BIP38 password elsewhere.  If they figure it out, they\'ll have earned themselves (some undisclosed amount of BTC i have in cold storage).\n\nIt\'s not an automatic way of giving it to someone when I die.

It should perhaps use a HD seed for 1st time turning on and a secured passphrase in conjunction to access administrative functions.   If the \'outlet\' is stolen or your move or something, the user would need to \'wipe\' the device to re-enter a fresh HD seed to use it.  It SHOULD plug into the existing private network (utilizing the existing access to internet from your ISP and router) and offer an extended \'for hire\' internet.  \n\nFor all intents and purposes Ethereum,Maidsafe,Stor-j are worthless marketing speak: "potential hopeful applications that can be tackled after the initial goal of a Bitcoin OS is made"  \n\nIMHO The device should (if they could offer it for 80USD) simply act as a p2p private hotspot 4 hire that uses the factom method and possibly a compiled minified bitcoreJS script tailored to work in conjunction with DDWRT - potentially earn back its income - allows off the grid folks a method to utilize someone else\'s internet if its already not freely available.  \n\nA \'self healing meshnet blockchain\' is not necessary.

Also, how does it make sense to have BTC running on all these different devices when its already running on an existing computer - I would rather want it to connect to an existing running BTC node and do its thing.  \n\n Disclaimer:  I do wish for something like the eplug to exist, but I also feel like its not going to happen based solely on the premise that it requires THIS \'OS\' to happen.  Furthermore, the white paper says, I quote:\n> 10 Purchasing an ePlug\n> Some were sold locally for testing purposes, but the ePlug will not be sold directly to the public, instead:\n> Many different electrical manufacturers are getting their electrical outlets and light switches "ePlug\n> Certified" once the mass-production version is ready.\n> Manufacturers will then offer an \xe2\x80\x9cePlug Certified\xe2\x80\x9d line of their existing electrical outlets & light switches\n> that can be purchased from most home goods stores.\n \nSo if in earnest, Ken is raising 140K to do NRE (possibly bundling in the hiring costs of a Linux Kernel Developer), marketing/presentation materials, Prototypes, and possibly Travel/Airfare money to market to these MFG he wishes to license his technology towards.

What's actually been proposed is you verify part of the blockchain yourself, and just trust that the rest was mined honestly. Although if we don't implement UTXO set commitments first, you'll have to get the UTXO set from a trusted source, a source that can blacklist coins undetectably. Or may be forced too if governments decide distributing illegal data in the UTXO set is a crime. (Mike Hearn advocated we blacklist UTXO's in that scenario back when someone uploaded the child porn sections of the Hidden Wiki to the blockchain)\n\nAll this has the additional hazard that the UTXO set can grow up to as fast as the blockchain size itself. Right now the usage pattern is such that it's growing a fair bit slower, but than can change rapidly depending on what people use the blockchain for. Equally if we *do* implement UTXO set commitments, it becomes very attractive to use the blockchain as a massive key-value database for all kinds of stuff. This is why I've proposed we have a fixed-size UTXO set, and use TXO commitments to spend old coins, but that in turn uses significantly more bandwidth to spend txouts that have been dropped from the UTXO set, which puts bandwidth constrained miners at a big disadvantage.

No matter how much we want to scale Bitcoin main up, there *IS* a limit to its scalability, and at that point sidechains will take the additional load. But we need to get to the limits of Bitcoin main's scale, even though sidechains exist as an avenue to increase the Bitcoin ecosystem's scalability, because SC transactions are simply not as good as Bitcoin main transactions, even in theory (let alone practice). In terms of adding new functionality to the Bitcoin ecosystem, sidechains will be beneficial no matter how scalable Bitcoin main is, because Bitcoin main cannot be hard forked to add every feature we may want. \n\nSo I don't think the SC guys are looking at a more scalable Bitcoin main as a threat to demand for SCs, or at least I hope they're not.

There would have to be a UTXO set commit for the externally sourced UTXO sets to be relied upon. And I think claiming full nodes will not be able to validate all of the transactions themselves, and have to rely on others doing the validation, if the blockchain gets bigger, is quite an assumption.\n\nThe surest way to allow authorities in authoritarian countries and even liberal democracies to impose effective blacklists is to limit access to the blockchain to only a small number of financial intermediaries, and force everyone to use their off-chain solutions, by keeping blocks limited to 1 MB of transaction data for millions of users. \n\nIntermediaries are easy to regulate. Look how Coinbase is forced by regulations to spy on users' accounts and close them if they find they're spending on the wrong things.

In the US, banks belong to clearinghouses, mostly the 12 Federal Reserve district banks, but also a handful of private ones.  Checks are instructions to pay someone, but are not in themselves a transfer of funds.  During the day, incoming and outgoing checks are processed and added up.  At the end of the day, the clearing house opens a new account.  All the banks with more outgoing than incoming funds wire the net difference to this account.  Then the clearinghouse wires the right amounts to all the banks due a net of incoming funds.  After the account is zeroed out (cleared out, hence "clearing"), it is shut down.  Thus each bank makes or gets one wire transfer per day, instead of thousands to every other bank they owe or are owed funds to/from.  In the days before cheap computing and the Internet, this was easier.\n\nSince there are multiple clearing houses, the clearinghouses themselves clear through the Fed amongst themselves, also once per day.  So money going to another bank with another clearing house could take a day to get to the local clearing house, another day at the main Fed clearing, then a third day at the destination clearing house.\n\nThe main reason the Automated Clearing House (ACH) hasn\'t sped all this up is not every little podunk bank was ready to go electronic.  People still write paper checks.  Even though many of them are converted to images when deposited, some are still handled physically.  When a high enough percentage of transactions are electronic, they can go to hourly clearing or whatever.  The remaining few paper items would then be treated as exceptions with a hold time relative to everything else.  Everything else would be treated like cash - available to be used almost immediately.\n\nTrust isn\'t relevant.

The pledges are all collected as valid bitcoin transactions but the outputs (in bitsquares case 120BTC) are chosen before hand. The transaction is only valid if enough outputs are collected.

Decentralized crowdfunding, no middle-man, no fees. \n': 1, "I might be wrong, but my understanding based on [this](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Contracts#Example_3:_Assurance_contracts) is that the coins aren't actually spent (i.e. no transaction is sent to the bitcoin network) until the end of the assurance contract period. Thus, nothing happens to them.": 7, "If this was the case, they could have just set the goal lower to allow a lower minimum donation.

": 2, "Pledged coins remain spendable by donors until the organizer publishes the fundraiser transaction.\n\nA donor can spend a pledged coin at any time - or simply do nothing for now and spend later.

Larger donations are favored over many smaller donations.\n\nTransactions of more than 100,000 bytes in length are non-standard:\n\nhttps://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/2273\n\nThis means that larger transactions will be neither relayed nor mined into blocks by nodes running default settings.\n\nThe length of a run-of-the-mill input (donation) is ~150 bytes. This gives room for about 660 donations (transaction inputs) before all available slots have been filled.\n\nThe minimum relay fee for this transaction would be 100,000 satoshis, or 1 mBTC. Not a huge deal. In practice, the fee should be higher to ensure confirmation.\n\nIf every donor gave the equivalent of $50, that would mean the most that could be raised is $32,500. Dropping that to $5 gives a maximum of $3,250.\n\nIt seems that this style of fundraising disfavors small donations. Making room for a small donation means one fewer, valuable, slot for a higher donation.
