I do disagree with your statement that allowing an open marketplace for escrow will necessarily lead to a worse experience for users.

Even a single person can unilaterally set up their own sidechain.\n* If the sidechain becomes very popular, it can get full Bitcoin-level security if Bitcoin codifies the sidechain.

This is a softfork to Bitcoin.\n* If the sidechain is better than the main Bitcoin chain in every way, then perhaps the main Bitcoin chain could be phased out in favor of the sidechain over the course of many years. This would not apply to sidechains with trade-offs (eg. ring signatures, which have major performance/scaling costs).\n\nThis is a very smooth and safe way of making even rewrite-scale changes to the Bitcoin network.\n\nUntil decentralized sidechains, I guess my previous statement about altcoins being pointless is not quite true.

Ethereum has a special developer-controlled key which allows them to invalidate any chain they want. Most experts believe that Ripple cannot function unless the list of hubs is shared globally, giving whoever decides this list (ie. Ripple devs) total control. Etc. Such cryptocurrencies don\'t have to worry about a number of problems that Bitcoin does because the centralized controller of the currency can usually just fix things when they break, though they will have many problems that Bitcoin does not, especially once regulators wise up to this.

They plug in the account numbers into a form and the checksum digit is selected based on those numbers.\n\nTo find a missing number on your credit card number, write each digit in order, leaving an X where you are missing it. \n\nEvery other digit is multiplied by 2, with two digit numbers added together. In this manner, 1 becomes 2, 2 becomes 4, 5 becomes 1 (10, 1+0).\n\nAdd those numbers together (without the missing number) to find a total. Take the ones digit of that total and subtract it from 10. If the X is in a single position, that is your missing number. If it is doubled and even, you must divide by two.

And this is mostly due to two big operators in both regions - CoinBTM in NY and Red Leaf in Chicago.\n\nI hardly can make any conclusion from your census map as well. I think it doesn't really make sense to connect bitcoin machine locations to race/nationality of people living there. Well, at least from NY map I don't see any correlation.\n\nWith respect to profitability, CoinBTM has 33 locations now on my map (I think 1-2 are pending, as I saw them via API), and they mostly have Satoshi1 machines (not Genesis1), so it is ~$6.5K (I think they have discount on this volume)*33~$200K invested.\n\nAverage machine has about $20-30K volume per month nowadays. And CoinBTM charges about 18% on buy operations now (from BitcoinAverage) - check prices of all NY machines here http://coinatmradar.com/city/113/bitcoin-atm-new-york/\n\nSo it is ~$25K * 33 * 0.18 = $150K gross profit per month. Assuming the volume is lower for each machine as there are pretty many close to each other, but thinking about ROI period of 6 months - they will need to have $200K/6/33/0.18 = $5K volume of one machine per month - and this is more than realistic. I know some operators have machines which bring $100-200K volume per month for 1 machine.\n\nCoinBTM did rollout over time one by one and not just investing six-figures amount at a time, probably by financing new machines from previous earnings.

At least on my site you can find online prices/fees level for most machines before visiting any location. Also you can call operator in advance to find what is the rate at machine. I don't think it is that big problem today.\n\nIn the blog post I mentioned above - you can see that worldwide average fee of all bitcoin ATMs is at 8% now, while in the U.S. average is at 10.8%. Yes, 17-18% is higher, but if it is set like this, that means it is most profitable for coinbtm, which you can hardly blame them for.

That is the new path mankind has taken. \n\nNow sleep tight my darling.\n\nNot sure I can dad.\n\nDon\'t you worry my love just learn like those little fishes swimming around bigger sharks.
