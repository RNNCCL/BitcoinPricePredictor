If you sell to someone and then immediately buy back in, you are almost certainly a business.

What does an arbitrarily selected cap specification "doubling every 4 years" have anything to do with anything?  Do you think the bitcoin market growth has to match some arbitrary cap limit someone invented from thin air?

A higher cap doesn\'t make blocks become larger, the bitcoin market decides that.  And if the market grows faster than expected why that a bad thing that needs to be capped?  If a cap is installed and not hit then why was it needed?  If a cap is installed and bitcoin growth causes it to be hit (and jams up the system as we\'ve seen) then it would have to be removed, wasn\'t very well conceived in the first place, and shouldn\'t have been there.\n\nIn other words why have any arbitrary cap at all?  A cap should only exist if it is based on actual hard limitations of the protocol/technology.  The current cap was a temporary limit put in during the very early years of bitcoin when it was still very young and all the issues not well understood.

On the other hand, the proper cap is unrelated to demand. It is a very hard decision to make, and it may require a couple of failed attempts, but the right questions to ask are:\n\n1. How expensive (max) should it be to fully validate the blockchain?\n\n2. How can we increase capacity by making full validation cheaper (per transaction)?\n\nThere are a lot of unknowns, and  a lot of room for arguing still, but addressing those questions would help determine the proper cap-size-over-time function.\n\nAlso, I think Meni really nailed it when he focused on the "how do we handle demand that exceeds capacity" question.

Nor is the entire blockchain DB created by this blast of a million data firehoses going to fit on any storage media that individuals can afford to maintain. Moore\'s law isn\'t the answer to everything, and it\'s just a figure of speech anyway.\n\nIt seems plain that Bitcoin either has to compromise on full decentralization (and the fee-chasing arms race that will spiral it towards no decentralization or the usual 2-horse race that these contests always become) and gain the ability to form trusted subdomains of local autonomy (something like Bittorrent or one of those masternode-based altcoins), or else it has to compromise on being the world-conquering cash replacement that some wish to see it as, and accept a more limited role as a nifty bit of back end plumbing for other contract systems.

Unfortunately, OpenSSL is not designed for consensus-critical behaviour (it does not guarantee bug-for-bug compatibility between versions), and thus changes to it can - and have - affected Bitcoin software.\n\nOne specifically critical area is the encoding of signatures. Until recently, OpenSSL\'s releases would accept various deviations from the DER standard and accept signatures as valid. When this changed in OpenSSL 1.0.0p and 1.0.1k, it made some nodes reject the chain.\n\nThis document proposes to restrict valid signatures to exactly what is mandated by DER, to make the consensus rules not depend on OpenSSL\'s signature parsing. A change like this is required if implementations would want to remove all of OpenSSL from the consensus code."\n': 17, 'You would have to persuade people to change configuration, but it would readily give those who complain that the developers act as gatekeepers, the tools to effect change.
