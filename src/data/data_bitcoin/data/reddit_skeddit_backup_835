The solution is to set up a public listing of all shares so investors can confirm that their shares are being counted.

The point is to prove that the company has more assets than liabilities. There is no benefit to the company for understating assets or overstating liabilities so it doesn\'t matter if all investors bother with that process.

This is the real reason for the downtrend, I am convinced of it. \n\nI don't know much about markets, but I know that confidence in Bitcoin was profoundly hurt by the ghash.io crisis. This erosion of confidence was deep and profound. It tore at the very fabric of one of the basic things people had come to believe made Bitcoin special, namely, decentralization. \n\nThe fact that Peter Todd just threw up his hands in despair, and it seemed that Bitcoin was completely incapable of evolving past the problem, just broke something for people. No voice really stepped forward proposing a real solution, there was just silence. \n\nAnd what happened was this kind of loss of faith in Proof-of-Work, and a growing belief that centralization is inevitable, and since it is inevitable, we might as well go to the dark side and embrace proof-of-stake, since it offers many advantages once decentralization is off the table. And with that, slowly you had this growing movement of belief that Bitcoin has served its purpose, but it is time for us to move onto more advanced, 2nd generation, proof-of-stake (or its variants) coins. \n\nBut fundamentally, the embrace of these proof-of-stake oriented consensus algorithms really comes down to one thing, a deep feeling that Proof-of-work fails to maintain decentralization, and therefore all the wasted electricity is just that . . . wasted electricity. \n\nMany people at the time were convinced that ghash.io was going to really hurt the price in the long run. I think those people have been proven correct. Of course, there is no way to prove that they were correct, but the price did go down, and consistently, just as predicted. \n\nI believe proof-of-work is inherently superior to the proof-of-stake oriented algorithms for the simple reason that it separates power over the monetary system from possession of the majority of coins. Of course, someone with a lot of coins can pull market manipulation and what not, as Barewhale demonstrates, but they cannot change the code, they cannot double spend, they do not control the network just by virtue of having the most Bitcoins. With Proof-of-stake, they do. And in my opinion that is basically dangerous. \n\nI feel that if increased decentralization could be restored, through eliminating the incentive for mining pools or some other method, confidence in Bitcoin would be restored at this fundamental level and the price would follow.

It's important for Bitcoin's security that a big part of the economy be backed by full nodes. At the very least, all Bitcoin business (even small ones) should be running full nodes. But there's a tragedy of the commons here because each person who could run a full node doesn't lose a lot by not running one (there's only a very slightly increased risk of various problems), and miners don't have much reason to keep blocks small to make it reasonably cheap for people to run full nodes. So there will be a tendency for miners to make bigger and bigger blocks, and for people to gradually stop running full nodes when the bigger blocks make it too expensive to do so. Since this is gradual, no one's going to put their foot down and hardfork to enforce a smaller block size.\n\nThe market *might* find a solution to this problem if the max block size was completely removed. For example, maybe a decent chunk of miners would discourage blocks that they think are too big (even though this would certainly be bad for them on the short-term), or users would send transactions directly to miners that they believe are acting reasonably, or concerned Bitcoiners would directly subsidize miners that are acting reasonably. But I still think that the average block size is likely to at least *gradually* increase faster than average worldwide bandwidth because miners have such a strong incentive to make this happen.": 2, 'Can someone kindly provide a quick overview on the potential effects and rationale, for and against, increasing block size?

This removes the "size" issue?  yes/no?': 1, 'If the max block size is not high enough, then there will be more competition among transactions for space in blocks, and transaction fees will need to increase. If fees are too high, then no one will want to use Bitcoin for transactions directly. In this case, transaction would usually be done by sending money through semi-centralized intermediaries. For example, if I had an account at BitStamp and I wanted to send money to someone using Coinbase, then BitStamp and Coinbase would just make edits to their databases and settle up later. This is pretty similar to how the current banking system works, though Bitcoin could provide some additional transparency and security. This model is probably how microtransactions will work with Bitcoin someday, but it\'s desirable for larger transactions to be reasonably cheap on the real Bitcoin network.\n\nIf the average block size goes up too much, then only people with very high bandwidth will be able to run full nodes. This is extremely dangerous because if there is ever a hardfork, only full nodes are able to "vote". (This is a simplification. Bitcoin is not a democracy. The dynamics of how such a situation would play out are very complex.) It is absolutely essential for Bitcoin\'s survival that the majority of Bitcoin\'s *economic power* be held by people who are running full nodes. Otherwise, the few people who actually have influence over the network will be able to change the rules of Bitcoin, and no one will be able to stop them.\n\nThe average block size needs to be somewhere between those two extremes or else Bitcoin will become centralized. Thankfully, while the exact limits aren\'t known, the reasonable range of average block sizes is probably pretty large. Today, block sizes between 200 KB and 10 MB would probably be survivable. With all of the changes listed by Gavin in this article, 50-100 MB would be possible, and this could increase as worldwide bandwidth capacities increase. In my opinion it\'s always better to err on the side of smaller sizes, though, since too-large blocks are more dangerous than too-small blocks.\n\nBy the way: When people first hear about this, their first instinct is often to propose that Bitcoin should automatically adjust the max block size in the same way that it adjusts difficulty. Unfortunately, this is probably not possible. The appropriate max block size has to do with how much data the network *can safely support*. Determining this requires outside knowledge like worldwide bandwidth costs and the relative costliness of current Bitcoin fees. An algorithm can\'t figure this out. Once the major problems with Bitcoin\'s scalability are fixed, I think that the max block size will need to be manually increased every ~2 years to reflect changes in the world.': 28, "Why do I get the feeling people will still be worrying about mining monopoly in 5 years?  It's like years of empirical evidence isn't enough. ": 2, "As opposed to a technical point of view, it is important to also look at the problem from a monetary point of view. I see Bitcoin's main function as serving as the foundation of the monetary system much as gold was in the past. If more full nodes means a more secure Bitcoin network then this should not be sacrificed in the name of greater numbers of transactions per second. Off-chain transactions can serve this role. There are other ways that off-chain 3rd party providers can be kept honest. Being able to anchor the world's economy to a scarce digital cryptocurrency standard would go a long way to solving many problems, but that digital gold must be as secure as possible.": 1, '**TL;DR: Gavin believes that if this roadmap is followed:**  \n\n>... if everybody in the world switched entirely from cash to Bitcoin in twenty years, broadcasting every transaction to every fully-validating node won\xe2\x80\x99t be a problem.': 37, "> Whenever you see a problem where the supply of a resource does not match the demand for it there's generally something wrong with price discovery.\n\nThe transaction fee is the price of transactions, taking into account demand to send transactions and supply of free block space.\n\nIt's a fact that the network can only support so many transactions per day while remaining functional and decentralized. That's the maximum supply of transactions. 1MB is surely not exactly the right limit, but exceeding the limit is dangerous, and there is no market force in Bitcoin that would properly set the max block size. This is similar to the maximum number of BTC: automatically adjusting it to try and meet demand is dangerous and probably impossible, and the market can't just create supply endlessly, so we use a fixed currency limit guessed by a human as appropriate (21 million). Unlike the currency limit, the appropriate max block size changes as the world changes, so it should be reset occasionally.\n\nI used to also be worried about how the max block size is seemingly not free-market enough. I am an anarcho-capitalist, after all. But I've thought about it for years, and I've come to the conclusion that a manual max block size is the best we can do.": 4, 'Invertible Bloom-filter Lookup Tables.

It's not as easy to convince your friend to use Bitcoin if there's an additional layer of trust, and if you're not running your own full node there's an additional layer of trust involved *somewhere* within the process. (Even if that trust is just ensuring the transaction makes it to the network)\n\nThat said, there's plenty of people not running full nodes that are getting by just fine now, so I don't think Gavin's really asking the community for too much. I think the biggest difference is that this is kind of a change in tone, we'd now be working towards transaction scaling and not worrying as much about blockchain size or block size which increases bandwidth costs.": 3, 'I don\'t know if bandwidth limits should assume current networking technologies.

Then you can choose to send bitcoin from paypal into the ebay system, and paypal will, eventually pass the amount owed to ebay (ebay owes its merchant) and that will be settled via the blockchain.

My point in that quote is that it would have been impossible to dynamically adjust the supply to meet demand (as the Federal Reserve tries to do for USD), and that a fixed algorithm for coin distribution is OK if it's somewhat reasonable. (Permanent 20% monetary inflation probably wouldn't have been OK, for example.)\n\nSimilarly, it's probably impossible for the max block size to automatically adjust to meet demand, and it's OK for the max block size to be defined by a fixed algorithm if the algorithm is somewhat reasonable.": 1, "P2SH was added by requiring extra restrictions on certain transactions. Previously, transactions matching the P2SH pattern only had certain restrictions, but after the change, P2SH transactions had many more restrictions. This change was rolled out in this way (IIRC):\n\n1. Bitcoin Core was changed so that miners enforced the additional restrictions on transactions in their own blocks.\n2. Such miners also included a string in their blocks to let the developers know that they'd upgraded.\n3. Once enough miners had upgraded, miners started hard-rejecting blocks that violated the new rule. Violations of the rule would result in a chain fork, but the fork with the new rule would win because it had previously been determined from step #2 that this fork was the most powerful.\n4. Finally, all full nodes were gradually upgraded to enforce the rules themselves. Blocks that violated the new rule were rejected by everyone immediately.\n\nThe change could have been forced by skipping to the last step. Bitcoin Core would have been immediately changed to apply the new rule after a certain point in the future (to give people time to upgrade). After that, any blocks violating the rule or building onto blocks violating the rule would have been rejected, even if 90% of miners were violating the rule. Contrary to common belief, Bitcoin is not a democracy. Every user (if they run a full node) enforces the rules built into their client *no matter what*. This is actually much more decentralized than a democracy of miners, since every user must manually approve any significant change to Bitcoin by upgrading before their node will go along with the change.\n\nForcing the change in this way would have been more messy because it would have resulted in a hard fork. People using old clients would have had problems, and the network might have become somewhat unstable for a few days. Even so, at the time I advocated doing this hardfork if miners refused to upgrade. Miners should have absolutely no special say in the future of Bitcoin.

This is nice because it rewards results, and not just something that is often a symptom of getting closer to achieving a result (e.g., commits). The downside is it\'s basically impossible to reward spontaneous bug fixes unless an issue was first created and then a bounty placed on it, and "unglamorous" but incredibly important development will likely not receive the same attention as issues that are easier for the layman to understand or seem sexier. From the perspective of the person donating in this way, there is a high amount of oversight in how the funds are allocated\n\n>**2) Money allocated by the project maintainer**: at least in the Bitcoin world, one of the major sources of funding for open source projects has been to collect donations in an address for the project and then for the maintainer to allocate it to contributors. This is appealing because the project maintainer should have a pretty good understanding of the material value of a given contribution. The downside is it\'s incredibly subjective, and can give the appearance of favoritism even if there isn\'t any. Also, sporadic or one-time contributors will probably not be included in the allocation of a limited pool of money. From the perspective of the person donating in this way, there is basically no oversight into how these funds are allocated.\n\n>**3) Money allocated for accepted commits**: this is a very objective measure, and rewards process over results. It requires that maintainers have a dialogue with contributors if they feel that they\'re gaming their commits to try and gather the highest tips. This in my opinion is the best way to reward new or sporadic contributors since the maintainer does not have to keep track of who all is contributing what, and there is an immediate payout in response to the contribution. There is also a fairly high degree of oversight into how the funds are allocated from the perspective of the person providing the donation.\n\n>Everyone has their preferences, and I think the ideal project funding is some combination of all of the above, since they all touch on separate issues and help mitigate some of the "cons" of the other funding sources.

This is a scarce (not infinite) resource. It\'s supplied by relay nodes and the demand comes from the users who want to transact on the network. There is some equilibrium price where the willingness of relay nodes to supply bandwidth meets the demand of users. (don\'t worry for the moment about whether this price is positive or negative, just note that a price exists).\n\nThere\'s another side to this bandwidth, however. Imagine for a moment there is no block subsidy and miners derive all their revenue from transaction fees.\n\nThe transactions which pay the miners are _also_ a scarce resource. It\'s entirely conceivable that miners would pay relay nodes to deliver fee-paying transaction to them, for the exact same reason that a steel mill pays suppliers to provide it with iron ore.\n\nThe bandwith needed to transport the block a miner produces to the rest of the network is also a scarce recource, that has an equilibrium price.\n\nKeep in mind also that all these people who want to get paid for providing various services only do get paid if the Bitcoin network continues to function.\n\nThis isn\'t a complete description of how market allocation could work, but it should be clear that price discovery is possible.
