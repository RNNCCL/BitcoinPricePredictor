At least two major flaws in this line of reasoning.\n\nA. This logic is based on the bitcoiner pipe dream that the whole world will adopt bitcoin and we won\'t have to do any conversions because we can spend our bitcoin as bitcoin. This is ridiculous for countless reasons:\n\n* Some countries will always have a vested interest in managing their own currencies and will ensure that the domestic currency is preferred by vendors over uncontrolled, non-domestic currencies like bitcoin. They would clamp down if bitcoin gained enough traction to threaten this policy and then you couldn\'t spend your bitcoin at any big publicly traded companies, chains, non-shady stores, etc. \n* Not many people or vendors in the world have shown any interest in adopting bitcoin and we could argue all day as to why, but it\'s objectively true.\n* If you make a comparable assumption for ActualMoney (e.g. "one day all people globally will be able to spend USD locally and there will be a major bank that has branches in every single country with no conflicting regulatory frameworks and no local conversion needed") then ActualMoney still wins out for peer-to-peer transactions as they will also be free.\n* Etc... Seriously...\n\nB. Bitcoin has fees *other than conversion to another currency* built into peer-to-peer (and any other) transactions!

There is no other way to put it. There is no other excuse for their outlook and ignorance.\n\nWhere all of this is headed is where it was always headed:  the shallow-thinking bitcoin noobs and statist masses will become (or are becoming already) disillusioned with bitcoin, because they never understood what it was all about.  They do not understand and refuse to understand that a blockchain with network effect (i.e. a currency or monetary system being valued outside the direct control of government/central bank) was never going to play nice with the state, and was never going to go mainstream in the way that they imagined it.  They do not understand bitcoin as anything other than some kind of decentralized paypal, with which to stick it to the banks or to save a bit on some fees, or fashionably buy their coffee in the morning.  They do not understand money, and certainly not market-based monies.  They do not understand how it comes about.  They do not understand that bitcoin is not yet money, and the implications of that and the implications should bitcoin become (successfully be bootstrapped as) a fully-actualized unit-of-account money.  They do not understand how secondary and auxiliary (even if still fairly important) are concerns such as immediate scalability, mining centralization, and good public image.\n\nHolding and demand to hold is everything right now.  That\'s it.  That\'s all there is to it.  We are trying to bootstrap a digital token or commodity, which has relatively small use-value as compared to physical commodities like gold (but does indeed have value) into high ubiquity and liquidity, such that organic market forces use what will then be the most or one of the most saleable commodities on the market and which holds the best monetary properties ever seen; and with that network effect, begins to produce demand for the token itself (not just demand to accept a new payment network called Bitcoin and promptly exchange for fiat).  We are trying to overcome this large value or use-value gap, in order to *will* this new digital token into that position (where formerly, physical commodities like gold relied upon their other, non-monetary uses in order to circulate widely and thus be in a position to overcome the double coincidence of wants problem associated with barter, or prior inferior currencies).  Bitcoin can do this too. . . .it holds a larger challenge to getting there, but far more potential, due to it\'s nearly perfect monetary properties and built-in payment network.\n\nThat is all.': 39, '> I see here many "suggestions" to noobs how to open a wallet first on Coinbase and Circle...\n\nRight, because those are the easiest ways to *acquire* Bitcoin in the US, currently.

The market has not been able to function in these spaces and evolve solutions to deal with the new challenges and incentives which bitcoin brings to its economy of users.\n\nA culture has been produced which teaches entrepreneurs to steer clear of trying to produce solutions to problems which fall anywhere near the realm of government enforcement agencies\' activities.

Cryptocurrency currently has the problem packet-switched networks had before TCP/IP; that is, they\'re all disconnected from each other. There is currently no way for a blockchain to trust transactions from another blockchain. Sidechains were proposed as a solution to this exact problem, and thus can be seen as an analogue of TCP/IP. \n\nThe notion that bitcoin core developers should focus only on bitcoin\'s "core" and not on *connecting* bitcoin to other things is like suggesting that ARPANET should have been focusing on "improving" packet switching within their own network instead of inventing TCP/IP.
