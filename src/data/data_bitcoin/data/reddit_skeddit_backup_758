Investors of that kind invest only in things which scale.\n\nYes, Coinbase makes money on exchange, each time somebody buys or sells bitcoins they take a small commission (difference between buy and sell price). Also they offer payment processing: when somebody pays in bitcoins, merchant pays 1% to get those bitcoins converted into USD.\n\nThis is an obvious monetization approach, and it can deliver high revenues and profits -- but only if the trade volume is big. And it will be big if there will be a lot of users, i.e. when Bitcoin will get mainstream, so to speak.\n\nSo that's a part of their business plan.

This security record has led to widespread adoption of Plone by government and non-governmental organizations, including the FBI.\n\nAnd if you think that's because Plone is simple, it's not the case. Plone has highly sophisticated architecture, as it is built on top of an [object-oriented web application server](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zope).\n\nSo, anyway, why is phpBB so popular then? Because it runs on ultra-cheap/free shared hosting which only supports PHP, that's why. It's not good, but it's cheap.\n\n> Anyways its not my business what you do with your money but it just seems like a very poor choice.\n\nDon't forget that theymos is the guy who is maintaining SMF-based bitcointalk.org, and he implemented _a lot_ of custom add-ons.

Just because it doesn\'t look different doesn\'t mean that I haven\'t made many backend changes to support the massive traffic. I\'ve also added several big features.\n\n> Where did you learn about Slickage?\n\n> What specific criteria made you decide to choose Slickage over others?\n\n> Which other firms did you pass on during the decision making process?\n\nThere was a public request for bids for several years. I received maybe ~20 bids in that time. A couple of these bids were very promising, but the applicants became busy with other things and were unable to do it. The others failed to demonstrate to me that they could do the job. (Maybe a few of them could have done it, but a lot of applicants just contacted me to say that they could do it, but without offering any reason that I should believe them. I am not an interviewer. I\'m not going to ask a hundred questions to determine your suitability for the job. You have to sell yourself to me if you want me to hire you.)\n\nThe bid prices increased as the forum\'s money increased. IIRC, I received at least a couple that were over $500,000. I don\'t remember the names of the people or firms that bid, though none of the firms had much more reputation than Slickage.\n\nSlickage was recommended by Warren Togami, who has himself done important technical work for the forum and Bitcoin Core. I trust him. After talking to James, I was satisfied that Slickage would be able to do the job. There are many software development firms. I probably could have found one that\'s cheaper and better. But I don\'t have time to research this (I\'m a full-time college student), I don\'t really know how to determine whether one firm is better than another anyway, and few trustworthy people were willing and/or able to help me find one. So I picked the first firm I found that was capable of doing the job well (after several years of looking).\n\nThe main factors that convinced me that Slickage would be able to do a good job were:\n\n* When I talked with him, James convinced me that he was very familiar with all of the relevant technical issues.\n* Like myself, James wants this software to become the premier forum software on the Web. He wants to sell custom modifications and support for this software in the future. Therefore, he has a strong interest and incentive in creating something really wonderful and having it used very successfully on bitcointalk.org.\n* Slickage was recommended by Warren, and Warren is in Hawaii and able to directly supervise them to some degree.\n\n> Could you provide information on how many BTC you currently hold on behalf of bitcointalk, and how much you have ever earned from bitcointalk?\n\nThe current balance of 1M4yNbSCwSMFLF9BaLqzoo2to1WHtZrPke is approximately how much I store for the forum. I reconcile this balance every couple months, so it could be up to about $200,000 too high or low.\n\nI pay myself as part of the mod payments. Any additional payment for admin/development work is added at that point. I\'m not going to add it up right now, but you can find the total by looking at the history of my 1NXYoJ5xU91Jp83XfVMHwwTUyZFK64BoAD address and adding up the incoming transactions that are part of big sendmany transactions. I don\'t pay myself very much.\n\n> Can you please show examples at any time during history in which you have demonstrated transparency in the use of these funds and the decision making process? ("But it\'s on the blockchain!" -- yeah, I mean account for where money is coming from and going to.)\n\nThere isn\'t much transparency in decision-making. I read/participate in public discussions, and sometimes people send me advice; from that info, I make decisions. I only make public requests for comments if I\'m feeling unsure. [Here\'s one case where I did that](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=122466.0) -- there are many others.\n\n**If you want to influence how the forum is run, then you need to reach out to me and give me convincing advice.** I am very very busy, and I don\'t have experience in a lot of this stuff. I rely a lot on advisors.\n\nI don\'t publish detailed accounting info, but the income and expense amounts should be pretty clear from the block chain and from what I\'ve said. If I posted the accounting info, I doubt anyone would be surprised if they\'ve been following things.\n\n> In the sidebar of this very subreddit, it says that you have spent 10.35799117 BTC on advertising.

Hacker might impersonate a reputable person to post a panic-causing announcement.\n\nE.g. somebody might sell his bitcoins, make a post on forum saying that a critical vulnerability is found in Bitcoin protocol and that he sent details to Gavin, and then post from Gavin\'s account saying that vulnerability is confirmed, it is advised to shut down everything and wait until fix is made. People who see this will dump bitcoins on exchanges, and hacker will buy them, to get more bitcoins than he had before.\n\nSo, yes, bitcointalk.org security is crucial, for many reasons.\n\n> If running a SMF makes someone a expert in forum software\n\nHe didn\'t just ran SMF, he modified its source code. bitcointalk.org has many unique features which stock SMF doesn\'t have.

It would be fair to argue that it\'s a *high* rate, though I\'m not even sure that this is true. You probably walk past a dozen cheaper developers every day, but their skills/experience would be very different, so it\'s difficult to compare.\n* The goal of this project is to create forum software that *directly competes* with stuff like phpBB and SMF. This is a massive project that will be helpful not only for bitcointalk.org or Bitcoin, but for the Web community as a whole. The expense is justified.\n* Before I started this project, people complained constantly about the money just sitting around. Now people are complaining that I\'m spending too much!? Make up your mind.\n* You don\'t have any right to influence how I spend forum money. I am not a politician, and you are not my constituency. If you didn\'t donate (pretty much everyone reading), then this issue is totally unrelated to you. If you did donate and you\'re disappointed at the way I\'m spending money, then I\'m sorry to hear that, and I will carefully listen to any suggestions you have, but the donation page has always said that donated money is managed by me. It is my responsibility to determine how to spend forum money. Moreover, I believe that the donators who oppose this project are the minority.\n* Any accusations that I\'m "stealing" forum money is nonsensical. The money has always been transparently visible via the block chain. I\'m clearly not using it except in the stated amounts. There is some room to question whether I get some sort of kickback from Slickage (I do not), and it\'s totally reasonable to argue against the wisdom of spending the money *in this way*. But I almost never see reasonable criticism -- I see insults and nonsensical accusations\n* Most forum money is from ads, not donations. The money from donations was typically worth far less when it was donated than it is now.\n* The code is [here](https://github.com/epochtalk). The constant work on this code is evidence that I\'m not just channeling the money through Slickage to pay myself (though it\'s impossible to completely prove that I\'m not doing this). This code has been available for months, but I am amazed at not having received a single complaint about the actual code. I guess that means that either the trolls are too lazy to actually read the code or it\'s so good that no one can find even a single fault in it.\n* Remember that I was *given* varying degrees of control over bitcointalk.org, bitcoin.org, /r/Bitcoin, the Bitcoin alert key, etc. on separate occasions by different people. That is strong evidence (though obviously not proof) of my trustworthiness. But again, I\'m not a politician and I don\'t particularly care whether you trust me or not. (I write these posts because I find it *extremely annoying* to be criticized for my attempts to help the Bitcoin community, especially when the criticism is just mindless nonsense.)\n* Before immediately believing criticism and downvotes against me, think about whether you\'re believing actual arguments or just ad hominem attacks and the popular opinion.

Not impossible though.\n\nYou are right, PHP would not be my main choice if I were already a skilled programmer and looking for a new language to focus on. For me personally, PHP is what I started with (but have learned several languages since) and is what I have the most experience with. It works just fine for building fairly basic web applications (such as a blog, or forums).  More complex things like a trading engine and custom bitcoin implementations (looking at you Karpeles...) are definitely in the list of things NOT suitable for PHP though': 2, '> 10 years ago I was one of the main programmers in a team which implemented a PHP-based web app, which was quite successful and was in use for 5+ years.

A lot has changed in 10 years though\n\n> It doesn\'t matter that something is possible. When you\'re starting a project, you should look at what is typical. And you see that even high-profile projects like Wordpress had lots and lots vulnerabilities, and have problems with the architecture. So making a good PHP-based forum is just not feasible.\n\nWordpress is the epitome of a badly designed PHP web app. bad example... So because WordPress and some other high profile PHP projects suck, therefore you cant make good forum software using PHP?\n\nWhat do you think of things such as Composer and Laravel?\n\n> You cannot depend on your programmers being ninja jedi gurus who know PHP inside-out and make no mistakes. You can\'t hire such people. You can try to hire people who are above-average, but that\'s not enough.\n\nReplace PHP in that statement with any other programming language and it applies the same. Finding somebody who is a total ninja with programming and knows their main language inside and out and makes no mistakes... that is very rare, and those types of people can usually display such proficiency in most languages (most programming languages are very similar, just different syntax)\n\n> To be fair, an average, typical PHP programmers can deliver a web app. But chances are it will have a number of quality problems.\n\nSort of yeah. Your "average, typical" PHP dev is pretty crappy to be honest. That is just because PHP is one of the easiest to learn and start out with, the most widely supported and you can get away with having pretty loose standards. A 14 year old kid can jump head first into PHP as their first language, but you dont really see that often with other languages like Ruby and Python. If Python was extremely easy for newbs to deploy, almost universally supported and the go-to language for newbie web devs to start with, you would probably see something pretty similar (objectively though, PHP isnt the most well designed)\n\nmain point: there is no reason you cant create a solid web app using PHP. Can you specifically cite PHP issues which result in a "good" PHP based forum being "just not feasible"?  \nOther than the fact that there is less of a % of skilled developers.  \n\n*edit*: additonally, looking into the "plone" example you give (never heard of it in all my years...). Clunky site, riddled with broken images. Apparantly widely used by governments, non profits, museums etc..

[His personal website](http://kennyluong.com/about/me/) makes no mention of Slickage anywhere.

At this point, the forum coffers hold millions of dollars worth of bitcoin, all controlled by this single unaccountable twenty-one year old, while the forum has **never** received an upgrade or a facelift, and has in fact been compromised by hackers *several* times in the last couple of years.\n\n----\n\nTheymos, please answer some questions: \n\n*  Where did you learn about Slickage?\n*  What specific criteria made you decide to choose Slickage over others?\n*  Which other firms did you pass on during the decision making process?\n*  What price did Slickage quote you? What prices did the firms you passed on quote?\n*  Could you provide information on how many BTC you currently hold on behalf of bitcointalk, and how much you have ever earned from bitcointalk?\n*  Can you please show examples at any time during history in which you have demonstrated transparency in the use of these funds and the decision making process?

Where was this spent? What community input went into the decision of where to send these funds?\n\n*I am expecting that if Theymos answers these questions at all, assuming he does not delete this thread, the answers he provides will be just as vague and dodgy as his answers in the past.

So even if you do not have enough BTC to qualify for the free money, you can have the absolute freedom of selling Bitcoin on your own terms and receiving cash into your account instantly.  ": 3, 'Isnt linking your bank account to bitcoin transactions counter-productive to the whole idea?': 1, 'When we say "No Fees. Ever", we are referring to the fact that there are no transaction fees for sellers. You can leave your coins listed for sale until they sell, free of charge. There is a conditional 5% withdrawal fee if you wish to withdraw your order since it is free to sell, but it is capped at 0.02 BTC. This amount can eventually decrease as well if the price of BTC drastically increases.\n\nWe specified that we were only referring to selling in that text, we have never claimed that we charge no fees for buyers. The fees do not add up either, they are separate. Sellers sell for free, and are only charged the withdrawal fee if they withdraw their order. Buyers are always charged 2% for each transaction unless we are running a promotion.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nChad\n': 2, '>You say that as if the buyer fee is irrelevant for the seller.\n\n\nThe buyer\'s 2% transaction fee is irrelevant to the seller, as is the seller\'s withdrawal fee to the buyer. \n\nThe way our service works:\n\nSellers place orders for sale. Normally services like Coinbase and LocalBitcoins will charge a transaction fee for users that wish to sell Bitcoin (I believe they each charge 1%). We do not. To offset the fact that we allow users to sell Bitcoin without a transaction fee, we have added in a small withdrawal fee. It is not at all used to "trap" sellers, typically the only reason sellers are unable to sell coins is because they have them priced too high. For those intending to sell bitcoin for a reasonable price (but still pretty much always above market rate by some margin), the withdrawal fee should not be an issue, especially since they are using the service for free anyway. \n\nSellers are able to set their own rates for their orders (we do not buy or sell any bitcoin ourselves, we are a marketplace and just arbitrate transactions between buyers and sellers). If the seller marks their order above the current exchange rate, this does not have anything to do with us or our fees. The whole point of selling Bitcoin on BitQuick is to sell at the price of your choice, we do not determine any prices. \n\nAs for buyers, they are charged a 2% transaction fee. So if a seller sells 0.2 BTC for $100, they get all $100, but the buyer will have a 2% fee subtracted from the 0.2 BTC that they are buying (so they will end up receiving 0.196 BTC once the transaction is complete). We provide a service to our users, so unfortunately we do need to charge some fees in order to keep the business going.\n\n>The fee is how much of what the buyer pays doesn\'t go to the seller. If the buyer has to pay more to buy my coins, that means I can ask less for them. Whether you call this a fee for the buyer or for the seller is mostly irrelevant.\n\nI\'m not quite sure what you\'re saying here, but here\'s a TL;DR of our fee structure again:\n\n**Transaction fees:**\n\n-Buyers: 2%\n\n-Sellers: 0%\n\n**Withdrawal fees:**\n\n-Buyers: 0% (N/A)\n\n-Sellers: 5% (capped at 0.02 BTC, meaning it won\'t ever go higher than that) **NOTE: At the moment we are running a promotion, so until 12/1/2014 there are no withdrawal fees.**\n\nIf you ever have any additional questions, feel free to shoot me an email at chad@bitquick.co.\n\n\nThanks,\n\nChad': 1, '>If you want people to sign up I suggest you make it clearer to people what they are getting, before they sign \nup.\n\n\nWell, I would first like to say that users do not even need to sign up!

No more scams! **(Unlike LocalBitcoins, we offer secure and consistent arbitration here at BitQuick. If you confirm deposits within 3 hours, you will protected from any fraudulent deposits, and the money you receive is 100% guaranteed).**\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Set your own price and order limits. **(Set and change your own minimum sell amount and price any time you like. You can also peg the price of your order to the exchange rate of BitStamp and BitFinex, as well as Bitcoinaverage.com).**\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Fair playing field for all sellers. **(All sellers are on the same terms, so there\'s no need for reputation or ratings for sellers since BitQuick is the one that distributes the funds to the buyer, and we always do so in a timely manner).**\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Simple. **(Our service is very simple to use, and you can get started right away! No hoops to jump through, just link your bank account and receive cash).**\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Insured deposits with Xapo coming soon. **(Soon, Xapo will be providing multi-signature capability and insured deposits for BitQuick. Xapo is a trusted company that has received $60 million dollars in venture capital funding).**\n\n\nWhen consumers want Bitcoin immediately with cash, many find themselves resorting to the Craigslist-style marketplace, LocalBitcoins. The problem with LocalBitcoins is that there is no secure arbitration or consistent guidelines. Scams are rampant, and if you get scammed once when trying to obtain your first Bitcoin, you could easily become deterred away from the process and end up being too afraid to try again. People seem to find themselves more comfortable with using a trusted service that makes sure that each transaction is handled smoothly and safely."\n\nhttp://bitcoinmagazine.com/17685/bitquicks-new-campaign/\n\nThose were only reasons why selling is better, but many of them are the same for buyers, and buyers receive some of their own unique benefits from our service as well. \n\n\nRegards,\n\nChad ': 1, "What about those who don't have 1 BTC or have less? :(": 3, "Thanks for pointing this out!

That would imply that in order to truly secure the value we promised we would need to be buying and selling futures and/or options. Either one of those is too risky when dealing with such a volatile asset like bitcoin. So we do something we consider simpler and far more secure - we simply buy and sell bitcoin, take the dollars and put then in a bank account. Real dollars. So should a customer come to us and say, "I want out of this whole thing. Right. Now." We can accommodate their request without risk to ourselves or the reserve as a whole. And because we operate a full reserve, if the whole world woke up and said I want out at the same time, no problem. \n\nSome say they don\'t get it, stating that they can do exactly what we do already using Coinbase (for example). I suppose that is true to some extent, since both involve the buying and selling of bitcoin, but we see that as a dramatic over simplification. For starters, we offer *instant settlement*, and our exchange fees (0.45% BTCUSD) are extremely low. But we also provide consumers the choice of how they wish to hold their value - be it bitcoin, dollars, euros, yuan, yen or pounds... and our roadmap is already chock a block full of new stores of value waiting to be brought online. \n\nThere are two ways to look at Bitreserve in my opinion - you could say we are helping to resolve one of bitcoin\'s largest challenges when it comes to consumer adoption: volatility, or you could say we are helping to modernize the dollar by completely digitizing it.

The kind that paid all taxes, had a permit from the city, paid a fortune for  lawyers to ensure that I was 100% compliant, etc.  The Mayor had toured our collective, law enforcement was welcome inside without a warrant, I was a regular in local news and was featured in a couple of documentaries and the WSJ (my proudest achievement at that time).  A new DA was elected (democrat, I should point out), the next day our warrants were signed, two days later they were executed and I was held on $1 million bail until they released me a week later on my own recognizance, along with my uninvolved wife.  I was indicted on 73 counts of all sorts of crap--I think over 60 of them were money laundering.  In CA it is considered money laundering to deposit more than $5000 per week from "ill gotten gain".  So basically every time I walked into a bank it was another charge.  Mind you, the bank knew explicitly what we were doing.  We were located directly across the street and I\'d had bankers in my office numerous times looking to loan me money that I didn\'t want to borrow.  As a tactical measure/fuck you to the DA prosecuting me I hired her opponent in the election, who she coincidentally fired the day I was arrested.  I figured we had a shared interest in a strong fight.  Unfortunately they also indicted my wife (who never stepped foot in my shop to avoid any problems for her or my children).  The pigs specifically told her she was arrested for leverage since they heard I was a "fighter".  You know, like I believe in the rule of law and will fight to assert my rights under said law.  The reality of the legal system is that I ended up taking a plea to protect her and the 8 employees they arrested and charges as well.  I got ONE felony and 3 months of house arrest.  This pissed the DA off pretty good, so three years later, which was last month, she sent her highest level narc squad to tear my house apart and arrest me AGAIN on trumped up charges that were all dropped within weeks "in the interest of justice".  Not sure how my 5 days in jail fits into that "justice", but much worse things happen to much better people every damn day in this very country.  Though my identity is not a secret on reddit, I don\'t feel like blatantly doxxing myself, but if you have google and half a care to find more details there was a lot of news coverage and a documentary made about the whole thing.  Afterward the bank, who had the cops crawling through the place asking questions about my deposits and seizing accounts, offered me MORE money to help me through the situation.  So, you know, that wasn\'t a terrible thing for them to do, but was more an act by the manager of that branch who knew it was some bullshit than a BofA policy.\n\nTL;DR The rule of law means nothing, the devil is all in the details, and buy Bitcoin.': 2, "Not a terrible argument.

I\'m sure it will not be as through as you would like, but I will revisit at the end of the day.\n\nFirst off, I don\'t think you\'re being a dick. I think anyone who has been as fortunate as I have with being able to generate this level of support for our cause needs to stand up to scrutiny.  Your tactics are sensational for sure, but link bate works! People will read the hell out of this.\n\nGoing to try and go in order...\n\nAdministrative dissolution:\n\nThis is a form and a fee to reinstate. Which has been paid and filed. There is no bar to clear in terms of getting back into good standing.  More so, I have deep reservations about being a registered charity.  I think that asking permission from anyone to do good is ridiculous.  Had we not purchased Satoshi Forest we would probably not have registered as an organization. Our organization would continue to feed the homeless no matter what our legal status. And correcting our status within the fiscal year alleviates any concerns as to our property ownership. \n\nThe RV is titled in my name and is currently in Orlando, FL and has been serving as a base of operations for starting an outreach in Central Florida.  Similar to the recently publicized ft lauderdale laws, feeding the homeless is illegal in Orlando.  As to why the rv is titled in my name and not Sean\'s Outpost? The insurance cost of the vehicle being personally owned are dramatically less. It was the only fiscally feasible option. \n\n\nCryptocurrency control has been mine. So any shortcomings on reportings are mine alone. Similarly,  Mike Kimberl has control over the bank account that coins are sold into.\n\nFrom day 1 we have reported our cost of producing and delivering a meal at $1.25. We have currently fed over 130,000 meals to the homeless.  Which to my knowledge has never been in dispute. We are very public and frequent with our meals. That cost,  plus the publicly available lease and utilities information from the other post you quote, is greater than the USD value of all public donations(not from my wife and I) given to Sean\'s Outpost since inception. \n\nCan I give you an exact accounting off the top of my head. No. Is that ok? No. The main reason is we have always strived to do the most possible with the amount given. And we have done that in spades. As to my personal contributions, I have donated hundreds of BTC towards Sean\'s Outpost.  \n\nI am not balling or hoarding and in truth would give up all I have and will have in service of the less fortunate.\n\nI am all of those Jason Kings you have listed.  Serial entrepreneur and general asshole for most of my life. You left out my most spectacular fuck up. In 2011 I was an Associate on staff at TechStars Seattle and COMPLETELY FUCKED UP my relationship with that organization by having a very public very messy overdose from Methamphetamines and other drugs and all of the other related problems from being a piece of shit addict. Consequently that was my first brush with homelessness.  I live in the utility closet in the basement of techstars "the easy" for over a month.\n\nI almost died. \n\nAnd that was rock bottom.  It took a few years, but I got my life back together.  And with a new outlook have dedicated my life to the service of the less fortunate \n\nIn my previous response I outlined steps I thought Sean\'s Outpost and btc charities should start implementing to help transparency. And we are working on them now.\n\nI still firmly believe that the best thing a charity can do is show the work it does. Which i think we have done well and publicly. \n\nAnd we will do much better in the future. \n\nOur works are public and verifiable and outnumber the value of donations given. \n\nOur current bitcoin holdings are 2.1btc and most of that is about to pay the mortgage on Satoshi Forest. \n\nThe QR code snafu was an accident caused by Lisa Cheng who was kind enough to donate the website Overhaul for us. She corrected it immediately after notifying. I have left her name out of previous comments because i didn\'t think it was a big deal and was rectified quickly. \n\nI\'m sure i left out a lot and or caused more questions.

Bold claims I know. Its certainly seems to be a new concept that isn\'t anything like the current exchanges I\'m aware of. These developments are truly quite interesting.*\n\n\nFrom the link:\n\n"\n\n**What is MultiGateWay?**\n\nMultigateway (MGW) is a third party service developed on top of the NXT network that allows you to move cryptocurrencies in and out of the NXT Asset Exchange, the peer-to-peer exchange that offers decentralized trading with no trading fees.\n\n**How does MGW work?**\n\nMGW creates a unique deposit address for your account, for each of the supported coins. When you send coins to that deposit address, MGW will deliver to your Nxt account the same quantity of coin assets to your NXT account. Coin assets can be traded in the NXT Asset Exchange like any other asset: you can buy them with NXT, sell them for NXT and send them to any other NXT user with the fast speed of the NXT network.\n\nSimilarly, MGW allows you to easily withdraw your coin assets back into your corresponding coin wallet, with the lowest withdrawal fee in the market \xe2\x80\x93 equivalent to the minimum transaction fee for the coin.\n\nEvery coin asset is equivalent to one coin. The coin assets are backed up by the coins deposited in MGW, stored by the three MGW servers in multiple multisignature accounts for every supported coin.\n\nIn a multisignature account, the same address has several associated private keys or signatures. This means the servers have to agree, each of them providing their signature, in order to process the coin transactions \xe2\x80\x93 similar way to a joint bank account. The use of multisignature accounts and independent servers is what makes MGW more secure than any traditional centralized exchange account.\n\n**How can I use MGW?**\n\nMultigateway is a service integrated in the SuperNET software. Multigateway is continuously being developed, and is currently in beta stage.\n\n**Supported Coins:** Bitcoin, Litecloin, Bitcoindark, Dogecoin, Viacoin, Blackcoin, Darkcoin, Vericoin, Earthcoin, Maxcoin, Startcoin\n\n"\n\n*Looking deeper the integration with Coinomat provide exchange services with PerfectMoney, Ego Pay, OK Pay, and VISA/MASTERCARD. Ultimately this all happens within the NXT platform enabling the use of such services over a distributed network. To maintain nodes in the network many services require a very small fee, unfortunately this requires users to obtain a very small about of NXTcoins (from a centralized crypto exchange) to enable the aforementioned services.*\n\nI\'m newish here...mostly a lurker, hopefully my reddiquette is up to par ;)\n\n\nBottom line here, the NXT client is swiss army knife of crypto.\n': 1, "And people think Nxt's anonymous developers are actually a weakness...

It will also support the ability to program your own trade bots, and allow for people to subscribe to other people's open source bots and share in the profits - without having to trust their funds with a centralized party. The days of trading on centralized exchanges are quickly coming to an end.\n\nAnd lets not forget teleport and telepathy... ground breaking anon tech that puts coinshuffle to shame: https://www.copy.com/s/x4mYj7Cy9tNtwwXg/crossing_the_last_mile_-_telepathy_2014-11-04.pdf.

The three servers are run by three separate trusted and well known entities(who have an incentive in seeing the system succeed). While this solution isn't perfect, it is better then trusting your coins with a single point of failure(an exchange) who also charges you rather large fees for the pleasure. Trade fees are 1 nxt, less then 2 cents at the moment. Withdrawal fees are 0.0001 btc. No crappy % based fees. Also, these 3 server do not need to have their ips exposed the internet. Nobody knows where they even are which makes hacking that much more difficult.\n\nAgain this is not perfect, but it is better then what we have. Currently the 2 of 3 is a limitation of the bitcoin network not forwarding higher sig transactions. Over time this limitation will be lifted and we can add more and more servers to the voting pool to make it even more secure. This is a step in the right direction.\n\nI particularly like that I can directly buy btc instantly with my nxt without ever having to leave my client or send anything to an exchange. Buy btc, withdraw to btc wallet instantly.
