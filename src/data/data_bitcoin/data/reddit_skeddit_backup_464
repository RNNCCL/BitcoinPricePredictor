Granted, this only reinforces the common sense practice of *not storing your bitcoin on a exchange*, but surely they need to be straight forward towards their clients if they are not going to provide insurance on assets held at the exchange.\n\nMaybe the itbit CEO needs to reach out to Marsh insurance, the company that insures BTC deposits at [circle] (https://support.circle.com/hc/en-us/articles/202954724-How-is-my-Circle-account-insured-):\n\n>In the event that any bitcoin held in your account are lost or stolen as a result of a direct breach of Circle\xe2\x80\x99s digital or physical storage facilities, such bitcoin reserves are fully insured, subject to the terms and conditions of Circle\xe2\x80\x99s insurance policy with Marsh Insurance.

Of course not, they give you *cash value* for it, aka cut a check, and send it to you.\n\nThats what would happen at Circle if your btc was stolen from their custodial accounts. Marsh insurance would just cut circle a check, and circle would edit some numbers in their system and say 'walam, here's your money back' \n\nAlso, people often fail to understand that money is not actually 'printed out of thin air'.

You missed that part, obviously.  \n\n **EuroPac International Value Fund (EPIVX)**\n\nThe Euro Pacific International Value Fund is a new mutual fund that offers investors of varied means access to a diversified, actively managed portfolio. The fund seeks to provide capital appreciation and income, and is run by the same team heading up our wealth management division: Peter Schiff, as the Investment Committee Chairperson, and Jim Nelson, CFA, as the Portfolio Manager.\n\nThe fund seeks to help diversify currency risk by investing in a number of countries with positive macro-economic fundamentals (including trade surpluses, low government debt, high interest rates relative to other developing nations, and low inflation \xe2\x80\x93 just to name a few). It is an alternative way to take advantage of Euro Pacific\xe2\x80\x99s global investment approach.\n\n**EuroPac International Dividend Income Fund (EPDPX)**\n\nThe Euro Pacific Dividend Income Fund attempts to maximize expected dividend income outside of the United States, using a top-down analysis to select the best currencies and sectors, and a bottom-up analysis to select the securities with the most potential to pay out high and sustainable dividends that grow. The strategy seeks to diversify currency risk and takes a long-term investment view with low portfolio turnover.\n\n**EuroPac Latin America Fund (EPLAX)**\n\nEP Latin America Fund (EPLAX) is a new mutual fund that seeks long term capital appreciation by investing in equity securities of growing but stable Latin American companies of any market capitalization, that the team believes are trading at attractive valuations relative to anticipated growth in revenue and earnings. The strategy is targeted towards US-based investors who are concerned about global inflation, growing fiscal deficits and below-trend growth rates that are challenging the investment outlook for mature economies.\n\n**EuroPac Asia Small Companies Fund (EPASX)**\n\nThe Euro Pacific Asia Small Companies Fund seeks to achieve long term capital appreciation by investing at least 80% of its net assets, which include borrowings for investment purposes, in equity securities of small capitalization companies located in the Asian countries of China, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam. The fund sub-advisors will focus on dividend paying small cap companies that they believe are stable, financially sound, and capable of growth.\n\n**EuroPac International Bond Fund (EPIBX)**\n\nThe EuroPac International Bond Fund\xe2\x80\x99s investment objective is to seek current income and capital appreciation. The fund invests primarily in investment grade government bonds, with the remainder dedicated to what the management team believes are undervalued corporate bonds from companies in attractive sectors with improving fundamentals.\n\nThe fund is run by Investment Committee Chairperson Peter Schiff and portfolio manager Jim Nelson, CFA, the same team that runs the EuroPac International Value Fund, and Euro Pacific Capital\xe2\x80\x99s wealth management division.\n\n**EuroPac China Fund (EPHCX)**\n\nThe EP China Fund uses a value oriented strategy with a long term focus on financially sound, stable but growing, dividend paying Chinese companies. The Fund believes that China will continue to grow faster over the long term than many developed countries due to the emerging middle class, strong consumer balance sheets, a fiscally conservative government and ongoing market deregulation. To benefit from these trends, the Fund is focused exclusively on finding those companies best positioned to benefit from the underlying fundamental strength in China. In our quest to generate attractive returns and limit downside risk for our shareholders, we balance the strong growth outlook for many Chinese companies with valuation and the company\xe2\x80\x99s ability and willingness to pay dividends.\n\n**EuroPac Gold Fund (EPGFX)**\n\nThe EP Gold Fund will attempt to provide long-term capital appreciation by investing in precious metals, precious metal producers and precious metal exploration and prospecting companies. While the Fund may invest in different types of precious metals, 80% or more of net assets will be invested in gold-related investments. The Fund is sub-advised byAdrian Day, of Adrian Day Asset Management, a well-regarded resource investor, who has managed precious metal investments since 1991.\n\nThe EuroPac Gold Fund uses a top-down approach to screen for and select attractive markets and sectors, and a bottom-up valuation approach to select securities, and focuses on a long-term investment horizon in order to realize value. The Fund's distinct allocation across precious metal sectors attempts to maximize upside while minimizing risk. The Advisor will focus on depressed major miners, high growth juniors as well as exploration companies. In attempting to minimize risk in the Fund, the Advisor will emphasize royalty companies (within the major miner space) and prospecting companies (within the exploration space).\n": 5, "remember in Wolf of Wallstreet when Leonardo DiCaprio learns that it's all about selling, making commission and keeping the party going?

It\'s not just the operating cost of running a full node that determines the number of full nodes in operation. It\'s also the number of people who have an economic interest in auditing the blockchain. Right now that number is very low because there are very few people involved in Bitcoin, relatively speaking. The way you increase that number is by increasing the size of the Bitcoin economy, and in a way where people are still directly accessing the blockchain. And for that, the block size limit needs to be raised.\n\nA balance needs to be struck between portion of the world population that can access the blockchain with their own private keys on a regular basis (raising the limit helps in this regard), and the portion of the Bitcoin using population that can easily run a full node (lowering the limit helps in this regard).

Last time we discussed this I had to stop because you were ignoring basic considerations. What are the costs of running a pool? Do you know of them? Can you think of how it scales? Can you think of how many full nodes you have to run to operate a 1% pool? a 30% pool? In both cases its a number between 0 and 2. Does running a full node become more expensive with more hash power? No. So now that I\'ve done that part of the thinking for you, is a full node a larger percentage of your costs at 1% or 30%? I\'ll give you a hint, it\'s the smaller number.\n\nI don\'t see what is so hard to understand, you are playing these semantic and avoidance games when you consider "pools" to be exclusively variance reduction organizations when I explicitly said that the problem was the pools creating unaudited blocks and your defining of "hashers" as if it had some implication in mining.\n\nThe simple truth is that as it becomes less efficient to be a small full-node-miner, less people will be small full-node-miners and will outsource their block production and auditing to large miners which is centralization.': 1, 'It is very important that people read this.

The problem with this sort of Pascal's Wager type of thinking is that it sees Bitcoin in isolation. In fact Bitcoin exists in competition with alternative chains that already exist or that may be formed/forked at any time, and those chains can afford not to be so conservative. \n\nBitcoin does have an immense network effect going for it, but that effect has its limits.

Many have alluded to satoshi and think full nodes should be run by large data centers.\n\n>The very large pools already control the vast majority of pooled mining\n\nPools controlling pooled mining isn\'t really a problem. Pools not having their blocks audited and controlling the content of the blocks for their blind hashers is a problem. That is why running a full node needs to be easy for the miner.\n\n>making it a tiny bit worse due to larger block nodes isn\'t going to significantly degrade the centralization situation in mining\n\n20MB blocks are significantly worse. It makes it so a miner can\'t passively run a full node and the power is delegated to the pools.\n\n> In the future, GBT adoption could make the operating cost for a pool to run a full node irrelevant\n\nThen the cost is in the hand of individual miners. The difficulty of running a full node increasing has a centralizing effect. If a pool can\'t manage to run a full node, the individual nodes sure as hell wont. GBT is less useful if miners don\'t want to audit blocks due to the large block size.\n\n>if the payout-variance shortcoming of small pools could somehow be solved.\n\nPool size doesn\'t matter if their miners control block creation.
