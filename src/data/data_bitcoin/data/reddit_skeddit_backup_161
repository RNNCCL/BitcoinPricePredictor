Let's say for simplicity that they want to do it in 1 MB chunks and that a 1 MB chunk of this user's data corresponds to exactly 1 MB of data in the block chain. This user would have to outbid everyone else on the network for 1000 blocks. Current average total fees per block is about 0.2 bitcoin. Let's say this person can 'win' every block by submitting a 1 MB transaction with a 0.3 bitcoin fee, and that no one will begin to outbid him. It would cost this user 300 bitcoin to back up his 1 GB of data. I have no problem with anybody spending 300 bitcoin on the security of the network.\n\n>If people are concerned about being priced out of the network because of something like this, perhaps we should consider raising the max block size limit, at least just a little bit.

I understand that people are concerned with 'spammers' overloading mempools on full nodes, but full nodes can choose what they would or would not like to accept.

I'll assume you're talking Scrypt coins although most work on a variation of this formula.\n\nThe 'highest profitability' is easily calculable with a few variables that we already know like our own/pools hashrate, block time of a given coin (no standard way of knowing this other than looking at an alt's code), block reward/halving schedule (same as previous) and the highest current 'buying' rate of that currency.\n\nSay we have 45Mh hashpower on hand and we are hashing against Globalcoin (40 sec block time, currently 3.125 GLC block reward, buy requests at 45 sat per GLC, difficulty of 0.18849067).\n\nFirst, we work out how many hashes/sec we need to find one standard block, within the standard block time.\n\n\n    Hashes per second = Difficulty * 2^32 / Blocktime_in_seconds\n    = 0.18849067 * 4294967296 / 40 = 20239031.58 hashes/sec\n    = 20239031.58 / 1000000 = 20.23Mh/sec\n\n\nThis means, if we had 20.23Mh of Scrypt Hashpower - we would find 1 block every 40 seconds. This is 'ideal', not taking into account variations of difficulty through Block retargeting algorithms, finding blocks early raising difficulty (KGW/Elastic band effect) and of course, competing with other mining setups for the block.\n\nThis can be crudely manipulated to work out a 'per minute' BTC rating:\n\n\n    (60 / Blocktime_in_seconds) * (Block_reward * Highest_buy_request) = BTC per minute\n    (60 / 40) * (3.125 * 0.00000045) = 0.000002109BTC/min\n\n\nWe can even get our 'bully factor' included, as with higher than 20.23Mh/sec hashpower (the 45Mh mentioned earlier) - we will find blocks earlier than standard block time:\n\n\n    (Our_hashpower / Hashpower_reqd_per_standard_blocktime) * per_minute_rating = BTC per minute (with higher hashpower)\n    (45 / 20.23) * (60 / 40) * (3.125 * 0.00000045) = 0.00000469BTC/min\n\n\nNow all we do - is monitor a given number of coins, apply the same formula to each and recalculate every 5-15 seconds and we will see for any given moment, what the 'highest profitable' coin given your own hashrate.\n\nThere are other methods for calculating profitability and also where to get these statistics without having to run a full wallet (not just scraping webdata) but this is a subject for another day.\n\nBTW: Disregard any calculator that bases profit around existing 'nethashrate' variable, as this is usually rubbish.": 1, '>["The current difficulty, exchange rate, exchange volume, and current profit ratio versus BTC are updated every 5 minutes.

The value add is supposed to be efficiency in closing these transactions, that is, that records are better kept, more easily verified, more immutable so it easier to pay up or settle.  This is a fine and interesting application of blockchain technology, if it proves out.  \n\nBut very importantly, there are only a few possibilities regarding a token.  In the first case of no tokens, the system is really just a documentation system. In comparison to Bitcoin, or any adhoc publicly accessible ledger/token/private key, it's a silly gadget.  In the case that the token is transferable via a private key of adhoc creation by anyone, then the token is an altcoin and will be forced to compete on the open market to have any value.  This then is pitiful in application as a settlement coin as it would have radical price volatility that no bank could ameliorate without huge subsidy and is likely to fail anyway as most altcoins do. That doesn't merit attention until the banks start pumping it.  Note that banks may be the least creative institutions we have, so it's likely to fail.  The middle ground case, whereby the bank blockchain creates a token only available to the members, suffers from all of these problems.  It has artificial subsidized value. It is not money. It is hackable; key management between rival banks would be a nightmare. It requires more trust than court enforceable contracts.  \n\nThe standards of accessibility and trustlessness that Bitcoinsets is very high.  \n\nRemember that banks most important function is a license of money expansion via credit of fiat.  They will live and die with fiat and will not offer an accessible coin.  \n\nFar more interesting is the eventual development of Bitcoin credit, ie contracts to pay back more Bitcoin later for some Bitcoin today and secondary markets for those contracts that are then tradeable assets that can be fractionally expanded.

It\'s easiest to see on the 1m because how it worked is a bot would market buy, then market sell 50 bitcoin. Sometimes it would do 100, but it most commonly did 49.x bitcoin market orders.

E.G it would run for 20, 30, 60 minutes a few times a day and throw a few thousand coins around. I believe this is to paint rising volume on the daily\\weekly charts leading up to the $500 top. But that is just my theory, so take it with a grain of salt. \n\nI saw it start roughly around the $192 fakeout bottom in August, give or take a week, and run all the way until in the chart I posted, sometime in the beginning of November.
