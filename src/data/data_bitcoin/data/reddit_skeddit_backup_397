As I udnerstand it (and I'm no expert in this area) the eliptic curve discrete log problem (on which ECDSA relies) just happens to be soluable in BQP but not, as far as we know, in P (or BPP) - meaning it can't be solved in polynomial time on a conventional computer but **can** be solved in polynomial time on a universal *quantum* computer.\n\nThe reason this is important is this: *if* we can build a quantum computer that solve real-world-sized problems in BQP in polynomial time, and *if* such a computer ever gets fast enough to break practical ECDSA, we may very well have a big problem: we can't anywhere near as easily just increase key size to fix the problem, as we have over the years with RSA and DSA (and an assumption that our adversary doesn't have a quantum computer).  Because that fix relies on the fact that increasing the key size hurts the attacker far more than the user.  If we ever find an attack in polynomial time, then that margin is, at best, eroded significantly.  Public key crypto can currently be performed on typical low end consumer hardware with keysizes that are proof against even the most well-funded opponent - and that's what quantum computers threaten to change.\n\nNote, this isn't fundamental to pubic key crypto - it just happens that factorization and the discrete log problem have solutions in BQP.  We continue to use them because they are well studied, have relatively small key sizes, and no one really believes that a universal quantum computer is imminent.\n\nBut there are other public key cryptosystems which can't be broken in BQP - they're just not widely used atm.  This field of study is sometimes called post-quantum cryptography.\n\nroy": 1, 'Depends on your input space, but generally yes.': 1, '[deleted]': 1, "It makes it a few orders of magnitude less likely that someone generates a matching private key to sign a valid transaction.

Businesses that make automated payments, like pools and exchanges, cannot decide automatically how to react to a backlog.  And so on, and on....": 1, 'Nice interview. Worth listening.': 2, '> What\'s the point of that if I may ask? If the "real clients" raise their fees, that would just mean that the test is working right? A fee market is establishing, while spam is being blocked effectively. Hurray!\n\nThe legit clients will raise their fees, the "stressors" will raise theirs, and the legit trasactions will still remain below the next block threshold.  Rinse and repeat.  And, with a bit of luck, there will be 10\'000 clients fighting *with each other* to be the 2500 entries that *may* make it to the next block.  It should be fun to watch...\n\n> those who claim that the sky is falling should cough up the dough.\n\nThose guys say that congestion is very bad for bitcoin and want to avoid it.

A payment channel, as far as I can tell, requires 1 blockchain trasaction to set up, 1 to close it, and at least 1 (or 2?) transactions to increase its spending limit.  The spending limit is bitcoins that the sender must lock up when the channel is opened, and remain locked up until it is closed - either by the receiver, or by a timeout of the receiver fails to close it in time.\n\nHow long does a payment channel can remain open, without being closed or recharged?  It seems unlikely that it can stay open and unused forever.  Would you agree with teh guess that *average* lifetime of a channel will be 1 week?\n\nIf so, then each LN user will contribute about 100 blockchain transactions per year, each paying some average fee F.  How much will F be?  If F is one dollar, then each LN user would have to pay 100 USD/year in fees.  On the other hand, a 1 MB block can fit ~2500 transactions, so with F = 1$ the miners will get 2500 $/block, which is less than half of what they get today (6000 $/block).\n\nIf each LN user contributes 2 transactions per week, then 7 million LN users will generate 2 million transactions per day, which is 3x the max capacity with 1 MB blocks.  So, **even if all the traffic migrates to the Lightning Network, the bitcoin network will not be able to handle a large metropolitan area with 1 MB blocks, or a single medium-size country with 10 MB blocks.**\n\nThere is worse, but I have to give a class now...\n\n": 1, "How many blocks were rewound?

The store checks the network queues, sees the payment transaction T1 at the front of the queue and no double-spend attempts, gives the gold, and the miner leaves.  But the store does not know that the miner is already at work on a version of the next block N that contains a transaction T2 that sends the same coins to another address.  The miner generated T2 himself and did not send it to any node yet.\n\n[1] If some other miner solves block N first, probably including transaction T1, no sweat.  The naughty miner still has the gold, that is worth the 100 BTC that he spent.  \n\n[2] If the naughty miner solves block N before the other miners, he sends transaction T2 and the solved block to the nodes, in quick succession.  The nodes will assume that T2 got delayed by natural causes, will accept the block, and discard T1 as a double-spend.  The naughty miner then gets the gold, the 100 BTC back, and the block reward.\n\nThe probability of [2] is equal to the fraction P of the hashpower that the naughty miner has.  His expected return on investment is then P x 100 BTC.  If [1] happens, the naughty miner loses nothing, and can try again, until he succeds.  (As soon as [2] happens, the store will learn a valuable lesson and will stop accepting 0-confs).\n\nNote that the miner does not waste any work, because he will get the same fraction P of the block rewards that he would get if he mined honestly.\n\nHe can try to pull several such attacks in parallel, making many e-purchases from various 0-conf merchants and trying to mine all the double-spending (T2) transactions in the same block.  In case [1], no sweat.  in case [2], all the double-spends will succeed.\n\n> of the effect on your reputation as a mining pool\n\nWhen mining the block that contains T2, and broadcasting it in case of success, the miner can use a different coinbase address, IP, and miner ID, so that they could not be traced to him.  He would also have to tumble the coins he got, both the double-spend ones and the bock reward; but that seems to be a solved problem...\n\nIf the naughty miner is a mining pool manager, things are a bit riskier. The members get only the header of the block to work on, and do not check the queues, so they will not notice the double spend T2 in it.  But they may have saved the headers that they worked on, so in a posterior investigation the pool may be identified.  \n\nHowever, the attack can be carried out by a staff member or by a hacker, who does not care about the pool's reputation.\n\n>  owning 20% hashrate (no single miner owns that much).\n\nI believe that some non-pool miners (21.co?

Lenders were secure because countries control tax, austerity and the printing of money, which meant there was always a mechanism in place to get their money back. It was always seen as a sure bet, and very very lucrative.\n\nWhen the Euro was introduced this mechanism was ended. It was done on purpose BECUASE that mechanism is fundamentally evil and ultimately ends in countries using tax money to pay debts and not pay teachers for example.\n\nCurrently there is no such thing as a Eurobond, meaning these private organizations cannot directly lend to the Euro region.\n\nThey continued to lend to individual countries in Europe, but with no direct guarantees as they had before because individual countries cannot issue currency, or print money. They can however introduce austerity. As austerity puts direct and political pressure on governments to accept lenders terms or face social unrest. Greece is a textbook example.\n\nBut if you regularly read the Economist or other such Financial industry papers you will see that they are lobbying hard for the creation of a Eurobond, an Germany is point blank refusing, which as much as the Germans are made out to be bad guys, is IMHO the right thing to do by the people.\n\nGiven that Eurobonds do not exits and that there is no guarantee for financial debts, the agenda has to be a return to the good old days, and that is the underlying reason why Cyprus happened, why Greece is happening and earlier, why UK left the ERM (exchange rate mechanism precursor to the Euro). The lenders who are mainly UK and US based do not want the Euro and are using the markets and Austerity as their weapons.": 2, '> we(collective) could make some progress(push its agenda).\n\nOh, the almighty collective.

This is, of course, how most modern economies used to work and why it actually made sense for private banks to create and employ credit rating agencies. \n\nToday, however, the only thing that really limits borrowing is the willingness of the borrower to continue borrowing. This is, at root, what caused the 2008 financial crises (and is perhaps also foundational in the situation with Greece today). When lenders have discovered a way of ridding themselves of the risk associated with the loan by transferring that risk to someone else -- thus making it so that any lending is automatically profitable -- they become willing to lend as much as they possibly can without concern over whether the borrower can repay. In such a situation, only the borrower is left with the responsibility to constrain themselves. But in any scenario where there is no constraint on lending, inevitably you will find a percentage of borrowers who actually anticipate defaulting, and who choose to borrow solely for the short term benefits with absolutely no expectation of ever repaying the money. \n\nThis is why a jubilee would actually help to alleviate the current moral hazard that exists in our financial system, rather than increase it. By having a mandatory debt forgiveness every such-and-such years, it increases the pressure on lenders to make sure they vet whoever they are lending to, to make sure they can repay their loans. Did the person they are lending to take advantage of the previous jubilee? Or do they have a reputation for repaying all of their loans? Anything that helps us to return constraint to lenders and increase their efforts to make sound loans, and anything that helps to remove the reliance on borrowers to self-regulate, i think is ultimately good for the overall health of the system. \n\nI believe David Graeber in his book *Debt: The First 5,000 years* explores the idea of the jubilee and its history. I recall he argues that most societies, historically, resort to some sort of jubilee or face a spiraling situation of growing inequality that undoes their economic health.

What\'s even worse, from a banker\'s point of view, is that if you stick to that 100% decentralized model, you can\'t transfer units which are not native to the chain - if you want to do that, you have to reintroduce a trust point that you tried so hard to remove.\n\nI think a lot of what financial entities are talking about is really the data structures - digital signatures, a linked list of hashes, and a Merkle tree for efficient storage and proofs.

There is not a single output in there which has been spent twice.": 2, "Ok, so let's raise the fees.\n\nHint: increasing the block size limit does *not* fix this, it just makes it worse.": 3, 'And reduces spam. And benefits miners.': 1, "Huh?  Transaction fees will rise drastically if that's attempted for any extended period of time.": 10, "That's a very good and important question as we're nearing the block size limit.\n\nThe short answer is no, we don't have a mechanism for it up and running that can do this in a good way.\n\nThe long answer is yes. There has been at least one solution for it for well over a year (2?) now.\n\nToday, if you send a transaction with an insufficient fee, it will not be confirmed and if no fee was attached at all it might currently not even propagate through the network. Your node/wallet could try and rebroadcast the transaction periodically, but it can take a long time before a confirmation regardless (if ever).\n\nThe solution we have now is called Replace-by-fee, by Peter Todd. Recently there was an episode about a (large) mining pool that adopted this (currently unsafe) patch.\n\nReplace-by-fee (RBF) is a patch which allows miners to replace a transaction in the mempool with another transaction that spends the same outputs but gives the miner a higher fee. Of course, miners can only do this when a user double spends their (unconfirmed) transaction with another transaction that pays a higher fee. Economically, it might make more sense for miners to use this (moar profits).\n\nA problem with RBF, now, is that it allows you to buy coffee at starbucks, take your coffe off the counter, walk away, double spend to yourself, and get your money back, getting coffee for free; stealing. Because most payment processors currently rely on what's called first-seen policy, where nodes only relay the first transaction they see (so no unconfirmed double spends) and miners only mine the first transaction they see; accepting unconfirmed transactions as payment is made more safe because of this. The problem here, is this policy cannot be enforced in the network, and abusing first-seen policy (and by extension, stealing from those that rely on the policy) is therefore possible.\n\nRBF could be considered such an abuse, but first-seen is inherently broken because it's unenforceable, so we need a better solution than first-seen policy anyway. In addition to RBF allowing you to steal, it also allows you to kick transactions that are 'stuck' into a block, and some other nice things. But we still need to fix the whole 'stealing' problem.\n\nOne solution to RBF allowing you to steal, is RBF-scorched-earth, and I won't go into it too far, but it allows the victim of an unconfirmed double spend to double spend that (yet again) until the entire payment is converted into fees (so the thief does not get his money back, but neither does the merchant/victim). Theoretically this means there's no point in stealing, because you will only give the profits to miners. It's a controversial solution, but it could work.\n\nAnother is first-seen-safe RBF, which, put simply, only allows double spending an unconfirmed transaction in a way none of the original payments are changed. It works and it's totally safe to deploy in today's ecosystem, but it doesn't have as many advantages as pure RBF.\n\nIf any of this is implemented today, and software/wallets improved to make use of it, then a fee market can seamlessly be realized. Today, however, only a handful (couple hundred, maybe) nodes will even relay an (RBF) double spend, and few miners will mine them.\n\n----\n\n> having both transactions confirmed when only one of them should be ?\n\nA transaction (well, its individual outputs) *cannot* be referred to in the blockchain more than once. Only when a transactio is unconfirmed can it be double spent and have a chance of being accepted in the blockchain; consensus rules make any block which contains a double spend invalid, and nodes will swiftly ignore and discard it.\n\n// edit: millions of typos; on mobile": 2, 'OK, thanks for the explanation.
