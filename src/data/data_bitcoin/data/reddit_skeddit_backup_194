But it depends on how does he do it, if he actually does it. \nCNH is not an option here, most people doesn't even know where, how or why to buy CNH, the confidence in USD is kind of mystical here. \nThere is also a lot of people holding usd that could sell them in the moment the ratio go up bit high. \nI really dont know if the credit card special foreign shopping tax is going to be removed, dont recall Macri talking about that. If the oficial usd get released but that tax doesn't get abolished it would be a really bad situation for foreign credit card shopping.  ": 2, 'There are not much "official" transactions we Argentines can actually do with usd. Credit card buying in usd currency is the most common, which uses "official" rate plus 35%  special tax, thats almost the same amount as "blue" (unofficial) usd rate.  \nFor most Argentines usd is 14.9 a long time ago already. 9.5 is just a state lie to foreign people. \nAnd no, there are no reserves built, so probably when the exchange rate get released the peso-usd rate will moon. ': 2, "I'm no expert on the situation, but from what I understand any official transactions processed through the Argentine banking system would use the lower official exchange rate & any off the books business conducted between individuals (think between tourists & locals) used the higher unofficial rate. Perhaps due to the ongoing downward slope devaluation the peso has been experiencing for years, driving up demand amongst private citizens for a safer store of value like the USD.

I can only imagine their must be a lot of uncertainty during this time of transition. I hope you are doing ok. Can I ask; Are you suggesting it could go higher than 14.9? Because in my mind, the minute capital controls are lifted anyone holding a large amount of wealth in the peso, will want to move into something more secure like USD or even CNH considering the trade links Argentina now has with China. I can imagine the effect of this wealth moving into other currencies could easily drive the peso exchange rate much higher than the current unofficial rate if this scenario played out. Moreover, this special tax you mentioned; Is it applied as a part of the existing capital control disincentives that Macri is promising to abolish on, or soon after the 10th of December? Thanks.": 1, "Thanks, I've been reading the transition away from capital controls is now looking to be a more gradual reform process rather than a snap Presidential edict. Primarily because of the engrained nature of the capital control's legal framework & networked characteristics.

Coltan, the industrial name for a columbite\xe2\x80\x93tantalite mineral from which columbium (i.e. niobium) and tantalum are extracted,[41] can also be found in Central Africa, which is why tantalum is being linked to warfare in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (formerly Zaire). According to an October 23, 2003 United Nations report,[42] the smuggling and exportation of coltan has helped fuel the war in the Congo, a crisis that has resulted in approximately 5.4 million deaths since 1998[43] \xe2\x80\x93 making it the world\xe2\x80\x99s deadliest documented conflict since World War II. Ethical questions have been raised about responsible corporate behavior, human rights, and endangering wildlife, due to the exploitation of resources such as coltan in the armed conflict regions of the Congo Basin.[44][45][46][47] However, although important for the local economy in Congo, the contribution of coltan mining in Congo to the world supply of tantalum is usually small. The United States Geological Survey reports in its yearbook that this region produced a little less than 1% of the world's tantalum output in 2002\xe2\x80\x932006, peaking at 10% in 2000 and 2008.[37]\n\nSo maybe your kit might not contain any Coltan mined from a warzone but the drive for it for consumer electronics is funding one of the most deadliest wars.\n\nNotice the two dates when it was at its 10% peak, they line up with the release dates of the PS2 and 2nd gen iPhone and other models of premium Smartphones.

Ideally I would like to break it down even further, but I\'m not quite sure what the best approach within 21\'s framework is. They kind of assume a one-to-one mapping between http requests and payments, as far as I can tell. One could maybe artificially break down the transfer into lots of small http requests and each one would use http range headers to download only part of a file. The underlying infrastructure at Coinado supports ranged requests, but that currently isn\'t exposed in this 21 wrapper. Artifically creating lots of small http requests seems like a hack though and is probably not great for throughput either.\n\n> If the connection interrupts, could I continue downloading without paying again?\n\nUnfortunately not, you would have to pay again. Not sure what 21\'s proposal is on how to deal with stuff like that. I guess I could send a refund for the part that hasn\'t been downloaded yet and then the client would need to be smart enough to only request the missing piece when it attempts again (requiring http range requests again - see above).\n\n> What were the considerations in implementing 21\'s proprietary off-chain payment protocol instead of supplying a standard Bitcoin address?\n\nMostly just curiousity and trying to make sense of 21\'s value proposition. Our normal service works with plain Bitcoin addresses ( see https://coinado.io/ ). There you would do this:\n\n    wget https://coinado.io/setup/coinado\n    chmod a+x coinado\n    ./coinado balance # will display a Bitcoin address to deposit to\n    ./coinado torrent 42ade26404772e26f1de2111b317f6543b51be0e\n\nSo with our normal offering you deposit some funds beforehand and then your balance is decreased for every byte you download. So in that case it\'s more fine-grained and if you only download half a file, you only pay half of it. And you can pick up at any point via http range requests, so resuming a download works as well.\n\nThis 21 wrapper doesn\'t have these features, but it isn\'t really meant to be "production ready" - just playing around with it. I agree that 21\'s off-chain payments are the least interesting part of it, because obviously just putting a central database somewhere makes it easy, but then you are back to the Paypal model. Then their API also supports on-chain payments, but that just has too much overhead for this usecase. If you download 1 GB files for 5 cents and then pay another cent in transaction costs, you have 20 % overhead and that isn\'t really practical.\n\nSo the most interesting part would be their announced support for payment channels. I think that could be very valueable to have a clear standard on how two machines initiate a payment channel for a service like this. You would still need to commit funds to it, but with the advantage that you can get them back, if something goes wrong. This still leaves the question though on how to best do metered payments per byte transferred, instead of per http request. As I said, 21 is currently set up on the assumption of the latter and I\'m not sure that framework is flexible enough. I\'m thinking it might be better to use the HTTP endpoint as a way to bootstrap - let\'s say - a websocket connection over which you would then continously exchange "mini invoices" and payments for them for the API calls that you make going forward.

If sent via TCP/IP that means there's a wait for acknowledgement after each frame. The frames are very small, and ack is very quick, until you implement some sort of delay for each frame.

Because I wasn\'t trying to which is why I prefaced my comment with "Clearly distribution is important..."\n\nYou have to consider it but you dont have to consider total hashrate. Its categorically more important. Think of it this way, if you could know the the hashrate of bitcoin in 5 years or the percentage each mining pool has of the network in 5 years, the hashrate is going to tell you exactly nothing about how secure bitcoin will be. \n\n> Both are important.\n\nIts statements like that which need to be backed up by arguments. Why exactly is the raw number important? It seems to me that it tells you nothing at all about how secure bitcoin is. I actually think bitcoin has become less secure due to the advent of ASIC mining due to the centralization of mining power even though the hashrate has increased dramatically. Its the idea that the hashrate as a number is significant in determining the security of the bitcoin network that leads people to believe bitcoin is getting more secure when in reality it may or may not be.\n\n>However your original comment seems to suggest that raw hashing power is not important.\n\nyes I stand by that statement. \n\n>Had you said, "Security also depends on the distribution of hashing power and the economic incentive of each actor not just the raw amount of hashing power." then I would not have felt the need to comment.\n\nI agree.

If the cost of hashing power halves then the new more efficient devices will be produced and sold until profits normalize at a higher hashrate. At that point its not the higher hashrate you want to look at because at the same relative distribution the security is the same. \n\nIf you know the cost of hashing then you could calculate an estimate of the total cost of mining given the block reward and you could make the argument that that is what is securing the network but again its not the total hashrate and would mean that bitcoin was more secure 2 years ago with the lower hashrate because the block reward had a higher value. \n\n> Clearly all else being equal (as in distribution) it would be much more expensive today for one to attempt to take over the network.\n\nHow are you quantifying that? I would think that an attack on bitcoin would be much cheaper because an attack would involve regulating the handful of ASIC manufacturers which is much easier than stopping GPUs which are already widely distributed. I would say that things have improved since ASICs first came out because at one point a single guy has 30% of the bitcoin hashrate in his hand (the first batch of ASIC chips) but thats an argument based on distribution, there are more seperate players now in the ASIC space than there where, had ASICs been 100 times more of an improvement in hashrate I dont beleive they would have resulted in more security for bitcoin except that the shift to ASICs would have been faster and more centralization would have resulted.

Use the wrong measure, and the monetary signals may completely mislead. **A fast-changing financial system makes things even harder: how does Bitcoin fit into global liquidity calculations?**\n\n> Such complexity makes the withdrawal of monetary stimulus by central banks even more difficult.

One difference between the current pull system and Bitcoin\'s push mechanism is that Bitcoin doesn\'t incorporate chargebacks.

The argument is such that a consumer must trust that the merchant acknowledges payment, ships the purchase, and generally won\'t flake out on the consumer. Then the argument devolves into how consumers should not focus on accepting Bitcoin.\n\n> Companies should stop aspiring to bring bitcoin down to the consumer-level...\n\nWhat?! \n\nFirst of all, chargebacks are for risk mitigation and have nothing to do with trust. I\'m certain that not all chargeback decisions made by big credit card companies are fair. One party is likely going to feel cheated. Therefore, the presence or absence of chargebacks does not aid in overall trust but is in fact merely a risk management tool. The fact is that chargebacks are completely unrelated to trust and this kills the argumentation dead in its tracks.\n\nSecond, sure Bitcoin doesn\'t have built-in chargebacks but that is no reason to give up and say that it is a completely flawed system.
