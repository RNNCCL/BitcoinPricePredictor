If Bitcoin was exactly as it was, but was at best only ever used by ten people how much value could it have? Not much, obviously. Success in Bitcoin isn't obtaining a three or four digit price point, it's obtaining a very broad user base, and doing that requires wide (and perceived to be fair) distribution. That's what keeps the price down. \n\nAt some point, however, things will flip. The units available to the market will not keep pace with the market expanding, possibly (and probably) by orders of magnitude. That's when the price itself will become more spectacular, which will lead to more news and attention, leading to more spectacular pricing still. The thing is, though, this won't happen in a nice orderly predictable manner, as people seem to expect. What I believe will happen, and seems to be happening now, is the market will seek fair value (which I think we're near now) for Bitcoin's price, until the market is compelled to reassess the situation.

(e.g. having 1 paper wallet of 10 bitcoin and loading it into a wallet for spending is a lot less safe than having 20 paper wallets of 0.5 bitcoin). The risk exposure is when you actually sweep the paper wallet and use it. Unless of course you carry a separate always-off device that just signs transactions, like a mini laptop or a trezor.\n\nAnyway what I do is I keep a cold encrypted paper wallet in my email, with some backups here and there The address is in my email without encryption. I keep a few hundred bucks on an insured hot wallet with 2FA (circle/coinbase/xapo). And then I carry some paper wallets worth a few thousand with me (with email backups) with very lightweight encryption (easy to memorize password, but would still take weeks to break, but not trillions of years). I just sweep the keys with my hot wallet to top up (that I use on my phone). The paper wallets are safe, the hot wallet has some risks but fairly minimal (2FA against malware, keyloggers etc, pin/password/find my phone against theft, insurance against counterparty risks) and never any large amounts. \n\nI don't like desktop wallets because it's harder to get 2FA set up, so they're a bit more prone to someone just keylogging your encryption password or seed, and/or stripping your wallet.dat file, or screen recording it.

Now you encrypt that private key and you send it to them in the forum of a QR code. As such you never really gave them the keys and is still cold storage if you generate the keys offline. You must however have a strong password as you still expose the keys to them to a degree. If it was a card where they generate the key for you (or you sent them an unencrypted version) then nothing is stopping them from keeping a copy of the private key and taking your Bitcoin when ever they want. The idea behind cold storage is to never expose the key to anyone or anything other than the file or peace of paper that is the place which stores it.\n\n>Am I correct that I can continue to safely feed my cold storage by sending money to it's public address?\n\nYes you can do this.

But the basic governance structure (the systems, not the people) I think aren't very strong.\n\nStellar for example seems to be much better thought out, as a pure non-profit with very clear guidelines as to how stakeholders and developers are rewarded. But that, too, is proprietary.\n\nFor something that's not even supposed to be geocentric, for something to truly occur globally, and be open and free to all, I think this notion of a proprietary software-based currency that's developed out of an office of a US organisation, also has issues.\n\nBut more importantly, ripple isn't similar to bitcoin in its promise. It's fundamentally different, as it's not a store of value. It's a payment system. So ripple is really something one could use to transfer e.g. dollar value over the internet. But at the end, you still need to trust your currency, and you still need to trust and use gateways. And these gateways aren't censorship resistant. Wikileaks would've been hard to fund with ripple as it's really based on this 'I trust this node and that node'. Banks would simply marginalize and ostracize and boycott and put an embargo on any nodes their government doesn't like.\n\nSo it's not a currency, not a store of value, has no effect on monetary policy, isn't inflation resistant, and is prone to censorship.\n\nIn short, it's a better SWIFT, that's proprietary with governance issues and hasn't really made any serious waves just yet.

In a more shallow market like bitcoin today, it's easier to move the price, but the spreads are pretty significant.\n\nSo the spread again is the differential between buy/sell price. Say you can buy for $500 and sell for $495. The issue is that if you sell and then rebuy immediately, you just lose money to the spread, even if you can trade at 0% fees (although most exchanges ask fees ontop of that, which just increases the spread.)\n\nIn other words, you really have to be lucky, skilled, well-timed, to pull off a mass sell-off, hope to create a momentum that you wait out for a cheap price, then buy back the cheap coins, and then hope for an upwards momentum so your coins appreciate again, that creates gains that outweigh the cost of the spread you inevitably end up eating in the process.\n\nFor example, if you'd done a sell-off at $330, hoped for it to drop to $250 and sold at an average of $310 (the moment you start selling big, the price drops, so you can't sell all for $330), but at $290 it created huge buying pressure and the momentum shot to $330 again, you just ended up selling your coins at $310 average and the price today is $330. Even if you started buying back around $300 when the plan failed, your buyback price (with the spread) might've averaged $315. So you just lost a bunch of money.\n\nIf it was easy, everyone would do it. You see some people try at times, some succeed. It's a part of every free market in any good.  I don't really see it as a huge problem, one that becomes more and more rare as the markets deepen.

They use getheaders to fetch block information prior to their wallet\'s birth timestamp, and request filtered blocks afterwards. To do so, they submit a bloom filter that describes the addresses and transactions they are interested in to the peer. The peer then only includes the relevant transactions in blocks it submits, together with their Merkle paths to prove that these transactions were indeed part of said block.\n\nSo, to answer your question more directly, your Client using Bloom Filters could request its relevant transactions in multiple requests, which might link `1BashCo` address to a bunch of addresses (one of which is yours), and another `1BashCo` address to a different set of addresses (one of which is yours).  And the only person who could potentially "see" that linkage is the particular SPV peer or a man in the middle.

Then, the "Block Solving" is like the master of all confirmations, putting together every transaction during that period of time for the whole world to see... but that does\xc2\xb4nt mean that your transaction is at risk before that!\n\nSo, in practice, if you are buying groceries form a neighborhood business you see every week, then there is "trust" in the transaction, relative off course to the amount being transacted. So the merchant will be satisfied with one confirmation, because he sees you every day and nobody will spend millions of dollars of hardware to double spend a few bucks. But if you are going to buy a house with bitcoin and you want to have all the universe cryptopower confirmation before signing the sales contract: 10 minutes that is.

Whereas Bitcoin strives to be as decentralized as possible, and builds a trusted network out of nodes which *do not need to be trusted*, Ripple is explicitly a semi-distributed network composed of varying trust relationships. Also, where Bitcoin never had any distribution of coins except via its mining algorithm (i.e. Bitcoin was not pre-mined), all of Ripple's 100 billion XRP were initially delivered to private parties. A tiny portion have since been given away for free or sold to the general public, but the vast majority are still held by these original centralized parties.  \n\nViewed in this way, Bitcoin is nearly a polar opposite of existing centralized, legacy banking and financial systems. Ripple, while new, is a much smaller step away from such past systems and will basically remain controlled and dominated by bodies that have varying levels of centralization, and which must be trusted in different ways to use the system. Also, distribution of XRP will always be at the whim of the initial large holders.

Thank you!': 2, ">What is a paper wallet?\n\nRemember that Bitcoin really aren't something you store. They are all over the internet as it is a distributed ledger. In a sense every node in the network holds your Bitcoin. \n\nWhat owner ship of Bitcoin gets defined as is holding the private keys. So while everyone has your Bitcoin only the person with a key to unlock it can spend it. We therefore consider the person to have the key to be the owner of the Bitcoin. \n\nA wallet holds these private keys, in the case of Circle they hold the private keys. Since he who owns the private key owns the Bitcoin this means Circle owns the Bitcoin on your behalf. Using a wallet of your own makes you independent as you hold it your self. \n\nSo when holding Bitcoin yourself you must be careful. You must have a back up of these keys incase one gets lost. You don't so much need to  be consciously aware of these keys as wallet software handles it all in the background. However to grasp the concept of a paper wallet and it's usefulness you should. These private keys must be kept private so you want to have a strong password that encrypts them and you don't share them with people.\n\nSo what is a paper wallet. It's a peace of paper that has the private key to your Bitcoin address written on it. So this is useful because of malware. If your computer is infected with viruses they might try and steel your private keys. So you put them on paper. Due to the way Bitcoin works you don't need the internet to generate private keys. So what users do is use a computer that doesn't have internet access, never has, and never will. You generate the keys on this computer and then print it out as a paper wallet. This is what you call cold storage. It means that your Bitcoin have never once ben exposed to any component that a hacker could try and attack. Essentially a paper wallet (is made properly) makes it impossible for anyone to steel your Bitcoin remotely as they need physical access to the paper. \n\n\n>Which wallet is good for a new bitcoin user?\n\n\nMy self I would recommend Electrum as it is a deterministic wallet. For example with Bitcoin QT it generates an address and each address afterwards that it generates is entirely new. So if you lost your wallet and went to an old back up all the new Bitcoins aren't in that back up. With a deterministic wallet like Electrum all Bitcoin  address from the past and from the future are stored in the backup. So you don't need to make constant backups for new addresses as it remains safe. \n\nBitgo is also a good option for new users security wise as it is multi sig (apparently its the wallet Ashton Kutcher uses). The way BitGo works is they hold 1 key, you hold 2 keys of which 1 key is your main one (that you use for regular spending) the other key is your back up key. Now BitGo is a 2 of 3 multisig. So this means you need 2 of the 3 keys to spend Bitcoin. So what happens is you use one to sign a transaction and BitGo uses the other. Since both keys are needed is your computer is compromised BitGo has limits on your spending that protects you from a hacker as the hacker can't use your key to spend Bitcoin. This also means that (unlike Circle) BitGo doesn't control your Bitcoin because they need you to move it. The backup key is something you keep ultra safe which is used incase BitGo disapears and they can't sign a transaction. By using your main key and your back up key together this means 2 of 3 keys are available and the Bitcoin is still yours. ": 3, 'True enough. I was indeed using the term "coins" to mean unspent tx\'s in order to simplify the explanation.': 2, "Consider setting up different types of wallets for different needs.  In general, use offline (paper/cold storage) for long term savings (roughly equivalent to your retirement account, online computer hot wallet for general use (similar to your savings account, where you want access but not frequently), then perhaps a smartphone wallet for daily spending (like your conventional cash wallet).  You don't put all of your Bitcoin on your smartphone, just what you want handy.\n\nFor different purposes, such as donations versus trading and buying, you may want to create entirely separate wallets.  BIP32 standard is for HD (Hierarchic Deterministic) wallets, that allows one master key to generate unique addresses as needed. Within that wallet, you can create subaccounts (or subtrees) for each of your needs. This would provide clear separation of donations from other bitcoin that you own (there is no practical limit to the number of subtrees and sub-subtrees).\n\nWith BIP32, a subtree may have a 'master public key'. This could be safely coded inside a website to generate donation addresses dynamically.  The private key for that subtree, or the 'master private key' could be used to move funds from those accounts, so it needs to be kept secret and not encoded on the website.\n\nHope this helps.

We can only guess:\n\n- Increase the cost of mining in order for other miners to turn off their machines (meaning: bearwhale has mining operation going on)\n- Bearwhale has interest in a low bitcoin market value (ie. to buy a massive amount of bitcoin off-market for cheap)\n- Early adopter decided to cash out\n": 5, "You can find someone who's forked bitcoin once, or someone who's worked with transacting over the network as a hobby with an ad.

I have only been at the Senate a year and a half, but this is clearly one of the best panels I have had the privilege of working with.\n\nSpeaking for myself, I view my role on this file as to assist, in a meaningful way, innovation, as you have discussed today. That's how I'm trying to look at this. How do we assist this innovative technology, this disruptive technology, as you referred to? You have to help me. We had a lot of conversation today started by our chairman around regulation or not.\n\nI would need specifics. What would you like this committee to do to assist the development of this, right to the point? What would you like us to do? Maybe the answer is nothing, and if that's the answer, tell us. But if there is something that you need to do to enhance Canada's position as a destination for innovation,\nI want to know that. Let's cut right to the chase: Tell us what you need from us.\n\n\n**Mr. Perklin**: I'll start. I'm sure each one of my colleagues will have comments. One of the things that would be beneficial to the innovation that my company is trying to provide to Canadians is the ability to open a bank account. When I am accepting funds from my customers in exchange for my services, I want to accept a cheque, but I cannot accept a cheque because my company has no bank account. I'm unable to do that. At the end of my tax year, when it comes time to remit payment to the government, I have no ability to write a cheque to give the Canadian government the money they deserve for the business I've conducted here in Canada. Instead, I have to have one of my employees write a cheque to the government on behalf of my company, and then I can reimburse them with bitcoin, because we cannot accept funds in any other way than cash. To answer your question specifically, Senator Black, one I thing I would love to see is the ability for bitcoin businesses in Canada to open bank accounts at our major banks.\n\n\n**Mr. Hoegner**: I think we would very much appreciate the focus and ability of the crypto-currency ecosystem to focus on arriving at its own solutions and to see how this plays out in at least the short to medium term. Bearing in mind the changes that have been made in Bill C-31 and in the regulations that are forthcoming, I would love to see this committee understand what crypto-currency is, really get its arms around what crypto-currency is, and not necessarily make any policy changes at this point.\n\n\n**Mr. Babin-Tremblay**: One outstanding issue is the taxation classification of bitcoin. The CRA classified it, I think, as a non-appreciating capital asset. Obviously, with Bill C-31, it's being included in the proceeds of money laundering and whatever the name of that thing is. You guys know.\nOne of the key dangers here that we have to avoid is to come up with some sort of double taxation scheme for bitcoin. If you treat it as a commodity, as for capital gains purposes, you cannot also charge sales tax and treat it also like a currency. That is one of the main outstanding issues that needs to be resolved: In which category does it fall for taxation purposes? I am sure Jillian has suggestions here, but from an entrepreneur, that's one of the important outstanding issues that needs to be cleared.\n\n\n**Ms. Friedman**: I think Mr. Hoegner spelled out very well what I would have said as an answer. I would add approach this questioning in the spirit of competition between different technologies and institutions that provide financial services and in a way that is as technologically neutral as possible. If you look at different services being provided, it wouldn't be fair to say that an exchange that has the same risk of money laundering, for example, changing from euros to Canadian dollars, has to follow this set of rules, but an exchange using digital currency to Canadian dollars doesn't have to follow this set of rules. If the risk is the same and they are providing a similar function, then by virtue of the idea of technological neutrality, it should be legislated similarly.\n\n**Mr. Babin-Tremblay: It would be the opposite road to take than what they have been doing in New York**. In New York, Benjamin Lawsky, the superintendent of financial services, came up with a proposal for bit licences, which was negatively received by the bitcoin industry for a number of reasons, most of them being that they are not technology-neutral. They are imposing additional requirements to bitcoin companies to comply with. That will most likely result in the isolation of New York and businesses moving out of the state of New York into friendlier jurisdiction, because it is impossible to comply from a technical perspective.\n\n\n**Mr. Pouliot**: The important key point is not to discriminate against bitcoin just because it is a different technology, to look at it from the functions and uses of what people are doing with the bitcoins. The community doesn't ask for much; I think I speak on behalf of most of the community when we say that we're not particularly inclined to go to government for extra help. But, for instance, some ministers in the U.K. have made positive statements regarding bitcoin. I'm speaking particularly of the U.K. where the minister of finance announced that he believed the U.K. could become a bitcoin hub. The community is receptive to government statements about bitcoin, so I think positive statements from our governments saying they think it's a great innovation -- and Canada does actually have a great potential in bitcoin -- just stating that fact, the symbolism of it, is enough.\n\nFor more info about\n\nBitcoin Embassy: www.bitcoinembassy.ca\nBitcoin Foundation Canada: www.btcfoundation.org\nBitcoin Alliance of Canada: www.bitcoinalliance.ca": 80, "Careful, that's An-Cap thinking right there! \n\n:)": 2, "It's probably worth noting that the exact same thing happened with the Liberals under Chr\xc3\xa9tien and to a significantly lesser extent Martin.

It would definately have to be voluntary, that\'s for sure, managed by the workers of industry themselves in a democratic fashion.

As in, one big democratic union.  I\'m not sure where the forceful redistribution of wealth thing came from.  Tarnished by the USSR and eastern bloc dictatorships I guess.  The Bolsheviks who started the russian revolution actually had anarchist allies rounded up, killed, and imprisoned after the USSR formed.  It was never meant to be a totalitarian dictatorship with sociopaths at the helm.\n\nCollective bargaining and striking for better conditions is an example of socialist principles in action.  It\'s one of the reasons the US now has a standard eight hour work day and child labor laws.  Workers collectively fought for those rights.  Google "haymarket affair" for more info on that.

Any and all powerful countries will have a strong currency, and only one currency per country. A currency\'s strength is reflective of it\'s country\'s political power. At this time, the USA is very powerful, and has the healthiest economy of any western country, which is why the US Dollar has been strengthening recently. As a result, the market has spoken, and has voted FOR the US Dollar and AGAINST bitcoin.
