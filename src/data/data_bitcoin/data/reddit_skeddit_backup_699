": -10, 'Space elevators! ': 1, "It's not that it's 'justified', it's simply that whatever price it is ($1 or $1000) will be such due to market forces (simple supply and demand). The 'justification' for a high price is that the market priced it at a high price.\n\nThat sounds like a cop out, but I say it merely to understand that the root of your question should be 'why would market forces drive the price up to $1k?'.\n\nWell it's precisely because what your student said isn't really true. Yes bitcoin works about the same, but it's not as useful at a low price. \n\nTake our planet, for example. Trillions of dollars are exchanged daily ($5.000 billion on Forex alone), these are huge amounts. Now take a city like London and imagine $50 billion dollars exchanges hands there every day in sales of bread. (hypothetically). What if that had to happen with bitcoin? You couldn't do it, there's only about $5b of bitcoin in existence. So you'd need all the bakers to use $5b to buy wheat from farmers, and the farmers would take the money and pay $5b to the bakers for bread, and so on, until the money circulated so many times that you were able to support $50b of trade. The amount of times over this same money is spent is the velocity of money (in simple terms), and that has a limit.\n\nTheoretically, you could support the entire world trade on 1 penny. You'd simply need to spend that penny tons and tons of times over every second. But obviously that is not possible, There are real practical limits to the velocity of money.\n\nWhich means that, if you want to support $50b in bitcoin trade daily today, the price of bitcoin would need to massively go up. And that's kind of how it works. If I wanted to pay someone a lot of money in bitcoin, I'd first have to buy it, and then I'd have to not sell it but hold it. And if I got paid in bitcoin, I'd want to hold on to that, too, until I had enough bitcoin to make that large payment. That, in essence, is me exerting a demand for bitcoin, while not supplying the market with any of my bitcoin. That's what drives up the price. If everyone wants to obtain bitcoin for making payments, and switches over from another currency, that's simple market demand which raises the price.\n\n**So in short, here is a hypothetical example**: bitcoin like dollars are value tokens, to make it more abstract. Now say there is an economy with individual participants which want to move around 1 million value tokens worth of value every day, say to support daily trade in a local economy. Now suppose only say 10 thousand tokens exist, and each token can only be traded up to 10 times a day in this economy due to technical and cultural reasons. That means only 100 thousand tokens worth of value can be traded daily. Given the quantity theory of money and what we know about supply and demand, what will naturally happen over time is that each token will go up in value by 10x, so that now one can trade 1 million value tokens' worth with only 0.1 million value tokens of trade. Whereas the low-value tokens were not able to support a large amount of absolute trade every day, the high-value tokens could. And that's why a low price or a high price doesn't work 'equally as well'. \n\nThis goes for dollars, too. Intuitively you know this, if we had only $3 billion worth of dollars in the US, then the average person only owned $10, and you'd know they'd be worth a LOT more in absolute terms if that was the only money available, $1 could probably buy you a house for example. It's simple supply and demand.\n\nAnyway for a more academic explanation look into the quantity theory of money: \nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity_theory_of_money\n\nSo the underlying notion really is that people expect more and more trade to happen on the blockchain, and that this in turn will require a higher price of bitcoin which naturally happens due to market forces. For example, Bitpay processes close to half a billion dollars a year. Coinbase probably does a similar amount. If in 5 years they started processing $20 billion a year together, you'd expect the price of bitcoin to rise as that level of trade cannot be supported unless the velocity of money keeps on increasing, or the price. And velocity of money is actually relatively stable, it fluctuates a bit but it's not like it goes from 1 to 10 or 1 to 100. It goes from 1 to 1.2 or something. While price, that's the variable that will be much more flexible.\n\nSimilarly, if only $100 worth of pizza was bought and sold each day using bitcoin, then each bitcoin could be worth mere pennies to support this tiny economy and there'd be no natural demand to drive up the price any more. (which was the case years ago).\n\nThis whole notion is not much different from other types of networks. Bitcoin is a money network, but imagine we were talking about a logistics network: vehicles moving goods instead of bitcoins moving value. If we only had 21 million vehicles (like we have 21 bitcoins) to move X amount of goods (like we want to move X amount of money), and people wanted to move more and more goods (money), the trucks (bitcoins) would need to become bigger and bigger (more valuable) to accommodate this increasing demand for moving more goods (more value), unless trucks get super fast instead (velocity of money). But technically, the speed of trucks will always be limited, while the size of the truck (bitcoin's price), is (in the case of bitcoin at least, this doesn't work in the trucks analogy :p) able to grow. That's the idea.\n\nHope that helps!": 12, ">Those blockchains and other forks do not work equally as well\n\nWhat makes you think this?

If I had considered money I would have maxxed out my credit cards to buy.": 9, 'How early is early? I\'m a 2011\'er, just barely.\n\n\nFor some reason my memory is so foggy leading up to Dec. 2013 that I had to look up some of my bitcointalk posts to remind myself. Ah. My first post on the bitcointalk site included the phrase "I missed the \'gold rush\'". As a miner, mine is a mining story.\n\n\nI started mining in Dec. 2011 but not dedicated. Just with my desktop 6950. I can\'t remember how I heard about Bitcoin but I know it was on the web and I probably ran into it because I was folding@home prior to Bitcoin mining. It was January 2012 I happened to purchase a laptop with a 6770m and started mining with that too (again, not dedicated). Got a 6450 for more monitors and used that too.\n\n\nI know I started with GUIminer but at some point early on, I switched to cgminer. Played with settings. Did all the stuff miners did.\n\n\nBetween late April and late June 2012, I purchased a 5830 second hand for $80 (the guy had like 5 of them for sale. Sold me the used one for $80 but wanted $160 for the new in-box ones. Did not buy any new ones).\n\n\nIn late June, I first used P2Pool. At that point, it was pretty bad. Made 1/3 of what I normally did on the competing centralized pools and switched back real quick. Pretty sure deepbit was my first pool before I went dedicated but once I had consistent hashrate, I chose BTCguild. At this point, I haven\'t had that moment where I understood how amazing the whole Bitcoin technology is, so I didn\'t really value it much. That summer, I almost spent all my coin on a laser pointer online. Luckily, I didn\'t. I spent it on BFL. This actually didn\'t turn out as badly as it did for most. All said and done, right now, I am even or slightly up from BFL. Certainly not from the first preorder purchase but between the cash purchases, the upgrade and the exchange fluctuations, I have roughly the same amount of BTC directly attributed to mining Bitcoin from BFL gear as I spent on it. The same goes for the cash that I got selling bitcoin because of the time I happened to sell a few. I got lucky with them.\n\n\nBack to late 2012. At this point, I\'d been mining pretty dedicatedly and had made back the amount of bitcoin I had spent on BFL with my AMD gear by, I think September or at least some time late that year. I remember I never got to that nice 1BTC/day but those last months that year, I was doing between 0.25 and 0.5 per day. For two weeks during my exams that December, being busy studying, it wasn\'t worth my time to get my 5830 back up when it went down. I always think back to that whenever I consider shutting miners down. I recently shut down my BFL gear due to the efficiency and that it wasn\'t making anything worthwhile compared to what I already had. I ran it for longer than some would though, I think.\n\n\nI had my moment of realization of how amazing the protocol is after I finally read the wiki more and researched more into how things all worked. I still didn\'t invest much because I\'m not a risk taker. At all, really. I think I had a conversation about the possibility of buying some at $8 but when it came down to it, I had a few hundred mined already and I just didn\'t see myself investing thousands of dollars in it.\n\n\nThen the next year the BFL fiasco happened. We all know about that. And if you don\'t, you can easily find out. As I said before, I managed to get pretty lucky... by giving more money to BFL as it happened, at the right times and the right amounts. Anyway, 2013 was the year I kept paying attention to the upcoming ASIC market. There were so many scams, so many bad companies, some good companies and even a few companies that looked like scams and didn\'t end up being scams. I should sum it up for that year.\n\n\n* Invested in KNC product, small-time. First pre-order. Arrived late Oct. and still mining with it. Currently, my received to the address I was mining to (exclusively used for the KNC) exceeds what I initially paid for the device. A return!\n\n\n* Invested in the KNC Neptune. Boy was that a worry. Delays and bad pricing and the possibility of not getting a refund. I had calculated and prepared a setup for the wattage they promised. I asked for a refund when they tried to make up for their delays by offering a second one to be delivered a few months later for free. I have a house, not a datacenter. Paid in bitcoin, got refunded in bitcoin and actually made a 29.74% profit because of the difference in exchange rate from time of purchase and time of refund.\n\n\n* Tried to get in on the first USB key miners from a DIY and a group buy. Group buy went well (Avalon). Guy who made the boards? Not so well. Apparently he was well-reputed before his disappearance. Most of what I threw small amounts of money/bitcoin into at this point, I expected to go downhill so I didn\'t pay attention for months. I finally checked to see the status of this guy who was getting the boards made and all I could find was a thread on bitcointalk full of people saying "he\'s a good guy" and "he must have had a reason". Well, all I know is that he ran off with $50 of my money.\n\n\n* At some point, I mined 1000 total litecoins. Not sure if it was 2013 or before but it was all CPU. Sold most of them for not much. Then the price (BTC/LTC) jumped. Managed to sell a few at a good price but not much else came of it.\n\n\n* Tipped some people. Emailed some people about accepting bitcoin. One guy got himself set up and I sent him some coin as a donation. I checked back a year later and now his website has an address. The coins in his original one haven\'t moved though. He must have lost the keys.\n\n\n* Though briefly lived, at one point, between the exchange rate and difficulty, I was making the equivalent of minimum wage per week if I take the total earned in one week and divide it by a standard 40 hour work week. That was pretty cool. Also pretty cool is you used to be able to buy a medium Tim Horton\'s Coffee a day on a few USB ASICminers. Now it would take nearly a thousand.\n\n\n* dabbled with the minimum amounts into those Bitcoin investments that were out (again back into 2012 too). Both platforms I used went under and I lost some between all the switching. I did have a single ASICminer share and he was probably the smartest. After the first exchange went down, he managed the payouts of the existing shares himself ("him" referring to ASICminer, not necessarily a person).\n\n\n* I\'ll always remember the first time Bitcoin hit $1k. I was in class and we\'d just finished our work. I had the charts open on the computer and a few of us watched.\n\n\nI\'m tired now and kind of losing it but to sum up the rest and anything I missed, throughout the past 3 years, Bitcoin made me take a closer look at money, at our banking system, at our economy. I\'ve spend a little more time scripting and playing with Linux because of Bitcoin. I even spent a little more time with some family and friends because of Bitcoin. I don\'t know any hardcore bitcoiners, but I do know people who find it interesting.\n\n\nYou know, there\'s a lot of cool stuff I left out and not enough of me willing to take the effort to think about it more and put it all in. So, I guess if there are questions I can be more specific. Or, maybe it was a terribly written and badly ordered ramble.\n\n\nI wasn\'t there (for bitcoin) in 2009, 2010 and most of 2011. I guess one of the most interesting things for me as I journeyed through Bitcoin was reading about 2009, 2010 and 2011.\n\n\nMy stance. Bitcoin is an amazing piece of technology. I do not believe those that think something else will replace Bitcoin that also uses blockchain technology because I cannot imagine something significant enough to warrant everyone switch. Nor do I believe those that think Bitcoin will take over the work in the sense of replacing what we already have. Bitcoin is an amazing evolution and will mesh well with what we have now because no one will stop it because of the innovation, the startups and those invested monetarily, emotionally and with their ideas for business and for future uses. Bitcoin may be small but it is big enough that it will always be there.\n\n\nAt the end of Nov. this year, I shut down all my BFL gear. My KNC miner is still running and makes about $5 every week. Or is it every 2 weeks? But when the new, lower nm stuff comes out next year, I\'ll probably shut KNC down too. I still browse for deals that match my standards for a 6 month theoretical return using a 15% diff increase per target period but most stuff I\'ve found is over after I factor in shipping. It would feel very strange for me not to be mining at all come early next year. My place is already quieter without the KNC gear mining away.\n\n\n\n^footnote: ^I ^am ^no ^so ^tired ^that ^I ^can\'t ^tell ^if ^what ^I\'ve ^written ^is ^coherent ^or ^a ^jumbled ^mess. ^Whatever. ^Save ^button.': 7, "Hey thanks!

I wish I were smarter. Please do simplified version...": 1, 'A Simple Primer (Explanation) For MARKETS, MECHANISMS & MEDIA.\nYou can read the paper here: https://danielmharrison.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/markets-mechanisms-and-media_harrisondm4.pdf\n\nIn economies of industrial scale, a company traditionally does this:\n\nIt Brands Itself (Spreads) x It Scales (Serves incoming flood of customers) / Streamlines Ops\n\nIt has to Streamline its ops - i.e. cut back a little on the push-push-push of the sales dudes hawking the brand and cool stuff on offer - because of the flood of customers coming in via branding so Streamline is represented as a divide in the operating process (it might also be the other way round at some points, too). This is a Market Mechanism company. Any company works like this that is traditional - an automaker, a supermarket, you name it.\n\nNow, recently companies such as Google, YouTube and others instead have does this instead:\n\nThey Streamline Ops (via their) x Branding (meaning they bang everything in one virtual place for you and serve it from one hub effficiently - as opposed to say, Coke, which has to get the mix of ingredients from supplier, get the bottle etc etc) \n\nThis means that the process whereby a customer is served (scale) becomes a more or less functional non-interpersonal one (so it is the divider this time, cutting back the interpersonality of the service which is inherently efficiency-driven). This way it can learn lots about your habits and target you accordingly! THIS IS DISRUPTIVE TO MARKET MECHANISM. This is a "Market Divider" where the market is being affected in an unusual sense (ie not being treated to personal interaction as is traditionally the case etc.)\n\nOther companies, such as the case of budget airlines for example:\n\nScale x Spread (meaning they go anywhere and everywhere in an untargeted fashion after the lowest common denominator of customer which no one wants - traditionally) \n\nThey get the same customers as Google does and because  of the flurry of customers they, just like traditional companies, have to REALLY Streamline ops (ever seen how tightly run a budget airline is?! That\'s because of this!) THIS PROCESS IS DISRUPTIVE TO MARKET MECHANISM COMPANIES This is a "Medium Multiplier" where the medium is acting in an unusually aggressive fashion for such a company.\n\nNow, here is the interesting part - the reason this disruption is happening is because the market mechanism is not very efficient so these disruptions are trying to address this inefficiency. But by addressing the inefficiency they create another inefficiency. Look, if I write:\n\n(3x4)/2=6 this is equally as inefficient as writing (4/2)x3=6\n\nWhy not just write: 3x2=6?\n\nSame deal for market mechanisms and all the disruptions - their math contains both multiplication and division (as defined above) no matter what. Except, in the last 5 years some exceptions to this:\n\nTake BuzzFeed. This company:\nScale x Spread x Streamline\nwhich is to say it goes to a market of readers - but not a market of customers; readers are their customers\' customers - and broadcasts the messages of its customers (spread x streamline) via its unique independent voice.  From these customers (advertisers) it picks up the money it earns by sacrificing the former cultural independence a competitor of its own (such as any newspaper) maintains it has from its advertisers! Why is this different from advertising? Because it\'s independent - like a newspaper, and the independence translates as endorsement. Why does this work? Because the contemporary culture has shifted as a result of the technological integration of the marketing process into everyday life that is now a part of global media (i.e. everyone knows that nothing is TRULY INDEPENDENT any more inasmuch as it is impossible to be truly independent in a world where the message is part of an INTEGRATED platform). What is happening here is that because this is a holistically multiplier-integrated model is that BuzzFeed is using the independence of its medium as a news outlet to charge much higher fees to its customers while entertaining their customers with its - ostensibly independent (via the medium; publishing) - content. THIS IS A SELF-SUFFICIENT MODEL. We call these companies X companies (because they are multipliers of market mechanics and because when plotted on the chart in the paper they look like an X).\n\n... or.... there is the Block Chain group of companies (think of Coinbase):\nSpread/Scale/Streamline\nbecause their customer acquisition and service process (scale) is integrated so tightly into the medium (spread) that its operations are automatically dealt with (streamlined) via the fact that lots of the traditional customer files that are usually filled in, or phones that are have to be answered, and complaints about missing money etc redirected is simply unnecessary (streamlined already as part of the technology\'s service provision). THIS TOO IS A SELF-SUFFICIENT MODEL. We call these companies Y companies (because they look like a Y when plotted on the picture I put in the article).\n\nThe basic tenant of the theory is that by around 2050 there will ONLY be X or Y companies, not the other lot mentioned in this article, which means airlines will have to address their customers needs and the needs of other parties who they engage with (maybe for instance the needs of their suppliers by helping Starbucks with promotions etc on board flights with free coffees they pay for) or that banks will have to adopt an integrated technology such as the block chain.\n\nI really appreciate you taking the time to follow and read this - many thanks!\n': 2, 'Sure - right now companies provide a mix of the following:\n1. Customized Service\n2. Production Efficiency\nwhich is fine, but not great. It means your iPhone costs a heck of a lot of money even though there are tons around and you get great service if you pay for it but even that service makes no time guarantees (only how tailored they can make the service to your liking - if that includes time efficiency then that will be an even more expensive component. Try getting everyone to be nice to you and quick! Think of McDonalds ...)\n\nBut with the evolution of companies as they are undergoing the service of their markets, the next era will have companies that are either:\n1. Customized production (with the efficiency, obviously, since they have that today already) - these are "X" companies since they are multiplying the scale factor\n2. Service efficiency - these are "Y" companies since they are slicing into the factors\n\nBasically, you\'ll have customized production (X) and service efficiency (Y). BuzzFeed offers its advertisers X while Uber offers its customers Y.  ': 1, "I'm not really following... Could you simplify this further for me ?": 2, 'Is Uber a Y company then ?': 2, "You got it! Uber is indeed a Y company. This is why it's getting so much agro from people since it is addressing the most ancient of industries! Taxi driving is in essence the rawest kinda Market Mechanism job there is (a bit like prostitution except you have a vehicle). A logical extension of course of Y companies is one day one will indeed serve prostitutes, when the medium can be refined to look like Paris Hilton ... Thanks for engaging! I am glad this is getting clearer. And well spotted!\n\nIt's interesting to think about the evolution of Y companies: right now, if there were to be non-human drivers invented, Uber's biz model would be about the only one ready to harness this. That's where it's headed. Basically, if the business model looks like it can be only be enhanced by more of the medium (technology) that's a good sign of a Y company. If the business model looks like it can only be enhanced by more potential mechanisms (competitors, partners, players etc.) that's a good sign it's an X company.
