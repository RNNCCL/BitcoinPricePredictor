It also points to a problem with the currency, having to do with the 'gold standard.'\n\nConsider gold (or gold-indexed money). When the adoption of gold as a payment method increased, demand for gold went up. So the price increased. But this also resulted in gold-mining becoming more profitable, so more people started digging and supply went up. This counter-acts the first effect.\n\nI don't know the details of bitcoin generation. But if it is indeed fixed (independent of how much mining occurs), then--in a sense--it is even more fixed than gold was. It is even more a 'gold standard' money than actual gold.\n\nThere was a good reason for why countries switched to fiat money. Fiat money just does a better job of performing the various tasks that we want money to perform in our society. It allows banks to manipulate the amount in circulation, making for stable values. It has several other advantages as well. \n\nThe situation with bitcoin is even weirder, because it is merely one among many currencies. With every transaction, buyer and seller have the option of using bitcoin, but they also can use a different currency (a fiat currency, for instance). (When gold or gold-backed money was used to pay, this wasn't the case. It was the only game in town, and users could not simply switch to a different type of currency.)\n\nNow, suppose, hypothetically, that the bitcoin adoption rate increases dramatically, resulting in rising bitcoin values. Now, suppose I am a SELLER. The bitcoin price on my items will go DOWN (because one bitcoin will be worth more). Why would I sell my item in bitcoin? That would be a bad deal in the short run. I would rather use a fiat money, which at least guarantees me that I receive what my item was worth.\n\nThis effect will counter-act the rising adoption rate, pushing it back down.": 1, 'Thats a great return in all honesty.

Just like PCs, mobiles, facebook, etc. as these networks grow, so will the chances that you will want to use it, maybe not now, but eventually it\'s drawbacks will be eclipsed by it\'s benefits and you\'ll be looking for your first bits to buy XYZ at your favourite store because paypal is such a PITA.\n\nb) paraphrased "Why should I use Bitcoin if the financial system can keep my money safe and I have legal recourse if it is stolen"\n\nValid point, in the super early day\'s people lost huge numbers of bitcoins to thieves (this was the 1 USD= 1 BTC days) and one of Gavin\'s early tasks had been to make the original Bitcoin client encrypted and secure to protect people\'s bitcoins. That was a long time ago, and Bitcoin security has come a long way. But yes, bitcoin\'s are still prone to theft as people are still too naive and inexperienced when it comes to handling bitcoins properly. Hardware wallets are a response to that need so that coins can in almost every instance, never be stolen (check out Trezor, ledger, and soon to come Coolwallet). Just like people had to learn to never open email attachments on unsolicited email, run antivirus programs and avoid shady sites, people are still in the process of learning the ins and outs of securing their bitcoins properly. It\'s actually not that hard  (I\'ve used Bitcoins since 2010 and I\'ve never had a single coin lost/stolen), but people have very ingrained habits where they have had almost zero incentive to be careful as they are always protected by the existing financial/legal system. Banks will always side with the customer in the case of theft it has actually ingrained into users to be lax about security. As a result the blame is shifted away from the customer and spread around to everyone to absorb the cost, whether that be rising fees, the merchants swallowing the loss, and higher and higher barriers to entry such that only someone that is fully identified and vetted can even get a bank account. With Bitcoin you are 100% responsible for your security, but you also never have to worry about ever applying for a bank account, paying exorbitant fees to cover the ineptitude of others, or having to strip yourself naked for the bank in order to use their service. \n\nThe bottom line is, Bitcoin offers all the flexibility of cash with none of the restrictions that banks and other financial services will burden you with, this also means you are personally responsible for keeping your coins safe, but this problem is being addressed by very smart people producing services and special hardware to make it super simple/safe/and secure.\n\n\nc) paraphrased "why use Bitcoin when the existing financial system has such a stranglehold on everyone\'s lives and has all the commerce?"\n\nI like to term the existing financial system (much like facebook) a bit like a walled garden. It very tightly controls the flows of money, and many here would argue this is part of the reason why it is currently in dire straits. Bitcoin is almost completely flexible in every way and the barrier to entry for merchants and users is very low. Any person can accept Bitcoin if they want to and no-one can dictate how/when/who/how much etc. , this is one of the huge benefits of Bitcoin that the financial system can\'t compete with. The financial system depends on identifying users to prevent fraud and that is never going to change, and it can/and always will be able to freeze or seize accounts, and it can always be in the position where it can dictate the terms of use, and shut out merchants/users at a whim. Bitcoin discriminates against no-one, there is no terms of service, and it will always be open to use by anyone with a smart phone and a network connection (it doesn\'t even *require* the internet to send money, you could literally sms the transaction into the network if you wanted to). For these and many other reasons, the old financial system simply can\'t compete with Bitcoin. The only advantage that the current financial system has is the fact that people are hesitant and inexperienced with using Bitcoin right now. Users fear what they don\'t understand and prefer the familiar and there\'s still lots of infrastructure that needs to be built around bitcoin to make it easier/safer/secure for the average Joe, but already the reasons to not use Bitcoin are quickly going away as it\'s usage increases. The financial system simply can\'t compete with Bitcoin once it becomes sufficiently large. Just like the internet and publishing, or old-style photography and digital cameras, or pagers and smart-phones, or fax machines, and email, in the early days the excuses were plentiful but the old technology quickly got superseded because it refused to innovate, while the fledgeling up and comer continued to improve itself.\n\nHopefully that makes things clearer.\n\n': 2, "You're right in a way, at this moment unless you're interested in bitcoin (politics, economy, social and/or technology), an average joe will just find bitcoin a burden.\n\nHonestly I just started using bitcoin, the one good thing I feel that is easier on bitcoin than conventional method is to transfer funds, especially international funds transfer. It is really effortless and dirt cheap compared to what PayPal, banks and other financial institution are charging. ": 3, 'Try bitcoin and see what the fuss is. Go buy $100 of it and spend it on stuff - after you experiment with different wallets/concepts. Thats really the only way to understand the answers to your question. And the result is 1) it doesnt cost you anything because you get to spend the bitcoins when you are done and 2) you will leave the experiment wiser and more educated.': 2, "Where is your sense of adventure? Bitcoin is the future. Set aside your fears and leave easier at the doorstep. Bitcoin is a currency built on math that will hopefully stand the test of time. It's not about buying a fucking coffee.": 3, "Your points are perfectly valid. There are a lot of people who do not have actual problems which Bitcoin can solve right now. And if you are fine with everything as it works for you, as you said, you shouldn't bother to try and force yourself to use it. The reason for me being so enthusiastic about it is not because it makes my everyday life so much easier (yet). There are benefits to using it for me, but to be honest, that's probably not worth the hassle to learn everything for most. I just see the huge gigantic technology (and social) potential. This will change a good part of our lives. \n\nThe comparison is often made, and it works quite well: think about the early days of the internet, talking about emails. It's tough to send one, you need to write weird stuff into command lines. And why would you want to send a message to the other side of the world any way? There is only a couple of nerds you can write to anyway. And your postal service is fine, it works, you can even insure letters and complain to someone if they don't arrive. \n\nSo should everybody have jumped on board using email back then? Probably not, for most people it wasn't worth the hassle. But it was important that a couple of users and engineers saw the potential of email and internet and went on developing. And for everybody, the point where it actually grew useful was met sometime during that development, some got in early, some got in late. But now even your grandma sends mails. \n\nIf you don't see Bitcoin improving your life now, that's totally fine. Just keep an eye on it, cause at some point it will. ": 9, "That is a very interesting video and I think it makes a great point. I am curious though, in the video the boy mentions that not a lot of people in Uganda know about Bitcoin, but that it works for him because he knows a place he can sell it. It seems to me that is a crucial point. If he didn't know such a place, they wouldn't be useful to him.\n\nAlso, he mentions how he thinks people would be freer if governments didn't control the currency. But I wonder if power would simply move into the hands of people who established themselves as early exchanges, such as whoever he goes to. I wonder who it is that he sells it to and if they are legitimate in all their business dealings apart from Bitcoin exchange. \n\nBut still, you make a good point, perhaps as a user of a credit card I am not as average as I might think. ": 2, "A. There are several purposes for money. If your current currency works for you carry on using it. Your motivation for using another currency could be several fold. For example you may wish to pay someone who uses another currency or laws in your country may restrict how much currency you can hold.\n\nB. Scammers and criminals are after money. Whether they threaten you with a knife, skim your credit card or set up a dodgy get rich quick scheme. All currencies suffer from this. Bitcoin is no different in this regard. It has some specific things that enhance the privacy of a transaction. For example you dont have to give up all your credit card details to a retailer and hope he/she keeps it safe.\n\nC. Some people of a libertarian perspective feel that Bitcoin, operating in a free market, outside Government control is a 'perk'. Some people also believe the current financial system is itself 'broken' and having an alternative is a good idea. \n\nThe assumption that Bitcoin is competing with fiat currency is a false starting point. Bitcoin has just (2009) been invented and people can use it if they wish. \n\nIt's unlikely that normal people using dollars, pounds or euros in their daily lives will find much use for Bitcoins. However there are plenty of startups looking at ways of using Bitcoin. That might mean that you can buy stuff at a local store via Bitcoin or it might mean that businesses find it easier to send money overseas at very low fees. Normal people may never use a Bitcoin at all but it might turn out to be a great tool for large payments between parties doing transactions like house purchase. Who knows? \n\n": 1, 'To expand a bit:\n\n> If I have no difficulty spending money, why should I be spending some other money?\n\nDefine difficulty. For me the old solutions are all inconvenient, limited and flawed.\n\n> On the other hand, I have this picture of Bitcoin being kind of wild-westy\n\nChargebacks are not free and in the end, all customers pay for it collectively. Bitcoin requires personal responsibility and the associated risks are transparent and well known.\n\nThe ones who prefer to rely and trust 3rd parties won\'t really appreciate this system, and it\'s perfectly fine that way.\n\nYou\'re right that it\'s "wild-westy". It\'s not for the faint hearted. If you would feel safer with insurance, then (again) check back later if things have changed. Currently, Circle offers insurance for their accounts afaik, but you have to sacrifice your control over the funds for this.\n\nNormally, people who are not disillusioned with the fiat system or centrally managed payment solutions do not appreciate the fundamentals of bitcoin.\n\n> I feel like regular currency (I guess you guys call it fiat, I see that word everywhere here) is like Facebook, and Bitcoin is like Google+. On the one hand you have a social media platform that massively, massively dominates the market. \n\nBitcoin is the first working alternative which does not require 3rd parties to function. Fiat currencies are not an option but mandated. Every single person has born into this framework. Before bitcoin, there was no viable solution to sidestep this "inherited system".': 1, '... and he knows for a fact that adoption is lagging, got that one in bold. Check back later then you can arrive in a safe comfortable blanket of mass appeal when adoption is rising exponentially but risk/reward will be lagging.': 4, "1: What you're doing today might not benefit all that much, but one day you might want to try something new where Bitcoin is the best option by a great margin, like international trade. \n\n2: With Bitcoin, the model has moved from trusted third parties and insurance to client side cryptographic security with (but default) no trusted third parties. This means securing it is your job, but if you know how to secure it properly them it is more secure than fiat because you can not lose money as a result of *somebody else* getting fooled. \n\n3: Network effects! Bitcoin will grow relatively slowly by spreading among people who consider it better for their use cases. And as time goes, new services and products and clients will be created and Bitcoin's usability will improve, making it worth using for even more people. And eventually it will be used by so many that the masses will flood in because they'll see the benefit for them too, and all the cool new things it can do, and the downsides there are now from their point of view will be solved. ": 1, 'In another comment James (the white guy interviewed) said that Ronald took the bitcoins to the bus interchange, and shouted "Who knows what bitcoins are?" So there doesn\'t seem to be much risk of centralization there! It\'s hard to even say whether Ronald or the guy buying the bitcoins was the "exchange".\n\nThe Android wallet Mycelium includes a decentralized exchange tool that lets you use your GPS to find someone buying or selling bitcoins near you. This makes it *very* easy for kiosks or corner shops to set themselves up as exchanges, just install the app and train the staff. There are some similar programs for desktop computers.\n\nThe end-goal for Bitcoin is always the point when people stop wanting to exchange them for local currency, and just use their bitcoins for trade. At first glance, the Bitcoin price appears to have dropped from $320 to $240 this year (-33%), but in Euro it\'s gone from \xe2\x82\xac262 to \xe2\x82\xac225 (-16%), and in Ukraine, Argentina, Venezuala (and other oil-reliant economies), bitcoin has actually *gained* in value this year. I certainly wouldn\'t claim that Bitcoin is going to end poverty, but these are a few ways that it helps level the playing field.\n\nIMHO none of this touches on the most groundbreaking aspect of Bitcoin, which is that, for the first time, anyone or *anything* can own money. If you don\'t need a bank account, or even a physical presence, all sorts of new financial entities become possible, so-called **DAC**s - distributed autonomous corporations, encoding of town charters in code, digital contracts which enforce themselves, and all sorts of craziness. I have no idea whether all this is going to be good or bad, my main question becomes "can we even stop it?" and if not, I want to be on board.\n\nThe source for the "bus interchange" story is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNfdKO22iD8), but it\'s long and I can\'t tell you exactly where he says it.\n\n': 1, 'Great example.\n\nNote: at the time, the alternative to email was faxing, which had many advantages: fonts / formatting, many more users, already in print form (most users printed their emails), and capable of holding up in court including signatures and amendments.

That alone makes you an atypical human. Less than half of the world has PayPal or Credit Cards. And to get either of these, you need a bank account, which only about half the people on earth have. Getting a Bitcoin wallet is far far easier than getting a bank account. \n\nCheck out this video about Bitcoin in Uganda:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrRXP1tp6Kw\n": 4, "A, B and C are right (with your experience).\n\nBut if you ask someone from Argentina or Cyrpus to evaluate these points, he will have a very different point of view.\n\nAll financial indicators are in the red right now (USA and / or EU).

Of course, there are other solutions to protect your wealth.\n\nAnyway, if Bitcoin is not useful for you, most people don't care.

These wonderful applications don't affect their lives.

Recall that from a demographics stand point, most UTXO "owners" (individuals who have knowledge of a private key) are typically young men from developed countries with access to a number of payment systems.  Since these other payment systems fulfill most of their requirements for retail purchases and because they have an expectation that token prices will increase in the future, many owners are holding and not spending the tokens (note: if you look around in this article you may be able to find some slides that show some of the numbers I am referring to: http://freebeacon.com/national-security/bitcoin-exchange-highlights-to-investors-currencys-ability-to-evade-sanctions/)\n\nBut not all people who shop online are young men, correct?  If you look through this Stone Street Advisors deck (specifically starting at slide 33), you will see some of the challenges facing merchants like Overstock, namely that women represent the bulk customer base and as a variety of surveys have shown, female bitcoin owners are basically a rounding error: http://www.slideshare.net/StoneStreetAdvisors/ostk-public-presentation-w-updated-about-ssa-v-2015112\n\nReddit can probably come up with all sorts of hypothetical scenarios for when, why and how people with bitcoins will start spending tokens on a regular basis to fulfill retail orders, but this is unlikely to occur for those in developed countries since their payment systems are for the time being "good enough" relative to the frictions they currently need to go through in order to obtain, secure and spend virtual currencies.

': 1, 'Not over the internet.': 6, 'From Ben Edelman, an associate professor at Harvard, as quoted in "The Anatomy of a Money-like Informational Commodity" by Tim Swanson:\n\nUsually, consumers pay the same bottom-line price no matter what payment\nmechanism they choose. Cash, credit, and (perhaps) Bitcoin are all the same price. Savvy\nconsumers choose a payment mechanism based on benefits, seeking the best rebates or\npoints. This market structure has predictable incentives: I choose a Visa Signature\nPreferred card with 2.2% cash back* not because it\xe2\x80\x99s the cheapest to merchants (it\xe2\x80\x99s not)\nbut because it\xe2\x80\x99s the best for me. (It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to find a card with a larger rebate.) Indeed, to\na merchant, my Signature Preferred is surely the worst of Visa\xe2\x80\x99s offerings because it\ncarries the highest interchange fees (charged to credit card processors, and in turn to\nmerchants) of any Visa card. But a consumer has no reason to consider or care about\nthose costs to merchants.\n\n\nHow does Bitcoin fit in? Suppose I wanted to buy shoes at Overstock that cost $100. If I\npay by credit card, the receipt says $100, but my card\xe2\x80\x99s rebate means I actually only pay\n$97.80. If I wanted to pay with Bitcoin instead, I\xe2\x80\x99d need to open a Bitcoin wallet and pay\n$101 to Coinbase to get $100 of Bitcoins (at the current exchange rate). (The extra\ndollar covers a 1% fee to Coinbase.) If I hurry straight to Overstock, my Bitcoins should\nstill be worth $100. (They\xe2\x80\x99re as likely to go up as down in the time I have to wait.) But\nnotice: The transaction ends up costing me $101 by Bitcoin, versus $97.80 by credit\ncard. I might try it once as an experiment. But I have every incentive to stick with my\ncredit card going forward.\n\n\nTo spur consumer adoption of Bitcoin, merchants should offer discounts for consumers\nwho use it. Suppose Overstock\xe2\x80\x99s credit card processor charges 2.9%, a relatively\nstandard fee. Is there a discount that makes Bitcoin preferable to credit cards both for\nme and for Overstock? It turns out that there is not. If Overstock reduces its price to me\nby 2.9% when I pay by Bitcoin, I still have to pay 1% to get the Bitcoins, which means I\npay $98.10 to get the shoes. That\xe2\x80\x99s still more than the $97.80 I would pay by using my\ncredit card.\n\n[* Looks like it\'s not an entirely realistic cashback rate for a cc, see discussion below]:': 4, "I'm buying Amazon stuff with Purse.io and 30%+ discounts seem pretty 'killer-appish' to me.
