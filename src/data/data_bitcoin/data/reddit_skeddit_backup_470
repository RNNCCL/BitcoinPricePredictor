Actually, it requires trust in Amazon. On the other hand, if a genuinely perfectly trustless oracle is possible (and it should be theoretically), then you have created non-repudiability fully.\n\n(A bit more clarification on that point: first, you can run TLSNotary purely, without a server; that doesn\'t give non-repudiability, since it only shares the proof of the page with one counterparty. This is probably a better solution for many scenarios, but more hassle for users. Second, there is no actual dependence on an "oracle" configuration for a server, you can use an ordinary server. The great thing is that, whatever server you use, there is no need to pass actual encrypted or unencrypted content to the server, so if it gets hacked, the worst thing the hacker can do is prevent the notarization from completing).\n\nThink of it this way: if someone tells you a secret, is it morally acceptable to pass it on?

That aspect *alone* is already an advantage that fiat will never have. ": 2, 'This assumes that humans(!) are slaves of machines and computers and algorithms and can do nothing. Fortunately, this is not true. The opposite is true: Humans have survived on this planet by now because they are creative and inventive. For the same reason I think Bitcoin will survive.\n\nIf there are 51% attacks, humans can find ways to eliminate the attackers. Those who say it is not possible are just not creative enough to think of some solution and re-iterate the dogma that "longest-chain-rule" in its current utmost simple and stubborn realization applies now *and forever*.\n\nI wrote elsewhere in this thread an example of how an intelligent majority of honest Bitcoin netwok operators can de-facto circumvent such a 51% attack effectively by a quite simple protocol extension of the miners (that could be deployed VERY quickly if needed - probably it is already in Gavin\'s drawer, just to be prepared):\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/34i3a7/andreas_antonopoulos_comment_on_51_bitcoin_attack/cqv6akn': 1, 'Do you realize that most mining is done in pools?

A truly malicious attacker that gets 51% can shut down the network pretty much permanently.\n\nOnce you get more than 50%, you always build only on your own blocks. Every single block by someone else will be treated as a fork, and since you have more than 50%, on average you will always have the longest chain.\n\nSo nobody else's blocks get included, which means nobody else get mining rewards. This will cause all big mining operations to quickly go out of business, as you cut off their entire revenue stream. These people could try to take back the network by deploying more hashing power, but how long can they keep doing that with zero income? If you have deep pockets, you are guaranteed to win that race, too.\n\nAnd once all blocks are mined by you, you can just stop including transactions, and the network shuts down.": 7, 'possible but only temporary and would never be worthwhile': 4, "Sorry for the late reply, but this got me thinking.\n\nEven if you don't need to censor high priority transactions, you still need to compete against the cumulative priority of ordinary transactions.

A state such as the U.S. Could easily ramp up the resources to 51% the Bitcoin network in far more than a temporary fashion. And worthwhile... Are you defining worth as making money through double spends? That's what people normally consider in terms of 51% at tacks - that no one would attempt such an attack because the costs incurred versus the gains to be had from doublesoends versus the decline in value that would occur due to shaken confidence. That rules out such attacks for personal gain, yes. But if the goal is to sink the network, destroy confidence in it or even the ability to transact, then it's hard to see why it wouldn't be worthwhile. \n\nYes, miners could engage in an arms race of sorts, deploy more and more hash power to combat it. But who in their right minds would throw good money after bad in trying to beat out a state actor?\n\nSo no. If a state truly wanted to do away with Bitcoin, take steps beyond just declaring it illegal, a 51% attack would be one easy but costly way of doing it. Another option would be to DDOs the nodes or mining pools.\n\nThankfully no states have taken such steps. But let's not fool ourselves into thinking that just because they haven't, that they can't. Would they, though? That's the bigger question. I personally doubt it. Even in a small state with apparently low barriers, etc, like Argentina, Bitcoin barely registers.

If formalized like that, a 51% attack would practically turn out unsuccessful (for the reasons Andreas is outlining), while the PoW core is maintained. Hence, the incentive to even TRY a 51% attack is going away and we will probably never see a serious 51% attack in the first place, so the PoW can continue to work and do its nice job, as designed.\n\n> Basically, Andreas is utterly full of shit on this topic.\n\nThis remark is not helpful.

Try not following it and fighting it in court and see what happens... \n\nSo even under a more specific standard (where a law/regulation has to specifically mention bitcoin), Europe isn't a wild west.

Indeed, the black markets prove that people are not helped by regulation, because they would rather break the law than submit to it.\n\nSo, regulation will be used by governments to fill their coffers, and it will be used by organizations like Coinbase and Circle to stamp out competition. Yet, this will only drive people into the black markets, and once there are enough closed loops in the Bitcoin economy, the gray markets will flourish anyway.\n\nMoreover, whereas regulation is necessarily local, cryptocurrencies are necessarily global; thus, regulation will only push the benefits of a cryptocurrency out of one jurisdiction and into another. If New York regulates Bitcoin companies with a heavy hand, but London does not, then companies will set their headquarters in London, and happily service the rest of the world.\n\nRegulation almost never generates wealth; if some "regulatory" action were profitable, then it would emerge on its own, without imposition.

Several hundred BTC were stolen from those addresses; fortunately, most of them were preventively stolen by that same "white hat" hacker, who returned them to BCI.\n\nSo, the answer is no: key generation software **can** generate weak keys or expose the keys in the signed transactions.

They hardly ever make any transactions; most blocks are empty, only a few transactions happen each week.

First, the title "the end of money as we know it" seems to suggest some binary outcome, like Bitcoin or what we\'ve had the last 100 years. It\'s unlikely the outcome will be binary. Gold for instance certainly isn\'t going anywhere. Gold has been valued as money for thousands of years, the reason central banks still hold it in reserve. The problem Bitcoin solves is one of money related to governments, but gold is something governments already can\'t abuse, which is why they\'ve abandoned their gold standards.\n\nNext, the questioner asks "...or is it a recipe for financial disaster?" Bitcoin was released in 2009. The financial crisis happened a year earlier in 2008. Argentina\'s currency collapsed (the last time) in 2000; the hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic happened between 1921-1924, and many more fiat currencies have gone to zero over time. To the extent the world experiences future financial turmoil it probably won\'t be from the advent of Bitcoin. Fiat currency has no problem self-destructing on its own.\n\nIf the full story isn\'t being told I wonder what exactly will be.': 1, 'we have shown it to a dozen broadcasters, who have all heard about Bitcoin in passing. most seem to like it. whether it fits into their programming schedules is hard to say at this point ...': 1, "That's fucking great!": 2, 'Oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy oh boy.': 5, '> Or, you know, there isn\'t enough gold in the world to conduct trade on a global scale.\n\nThat\'s like saying 21 million bitcoins isn\'t enough to conduct trade on a global scale. Both of these statements are of course ridiculous because each unit can be subdivided.\n\nIn the case of gold there would be some practical physical limit on division, but we could manage it even using nothing but gold for everyone, which would be unlikely. There are an estimated 10 billion ounces of mined gold in the world today. There are roughly 7 billion people. That means every singly person on earth would have at least one whole gold ounce to themselves. Of course you can divide an ounce by 100 at least, especially if it\'s to be represented in trade by a paper claim check, which would greatly increase any limit on division. Since there would be no inflation people would go back to earning only a few "gold dollars" per week, and that being sufficient income. That\'s with every single person in the world expected to trade and earn money at the same level, which is another thing not expected.\n\nNone of that factors in the increase in mined supply likely to coincide with gold rising so prominently.': 2, 'Feels good to be on the right side of the fence..': 2, "If that's the day the world is gonna end at least I get to celebrate my birthday the day before.

It highlights the Government influence on the money creation process and how it causes inflation. Moreover, this film explains how most money we use today is created out of thin air by banks when they create debt. Epic in scope, this film examines the patterns of technological innovation and questions everything you thought you knew about money. Is Bitcoin an alternative to national currencies backed by debt? Will Bitcoin and cryptocurrency spark a revolution in how we use money peer to peer? Is it a gift to criminals? Or is it the next bubble waiting to burst?\n\nIf you trust in your money just as it is... this film has news for you.': 24, 'Thanks for your comment. I disagree.
