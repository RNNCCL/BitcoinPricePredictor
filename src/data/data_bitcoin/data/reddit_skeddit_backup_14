It shows up as a writable drive and the user must copy files onto the drive. They are immediately forgotten, but the the file contents are hashed (SHA256). It\'s the hashed output of that which forms the private key (along with the unit serial number and entropy we derive from the environment). That happens as soon as 256k worth of bytes have been written to the drive. The private key is created and the drive "ejects itself" and comes back read-only and in "normal" mode... only the public key is shown until unsealed.\n\n> But Opendime could be generating private keys that look random, but are all from the same HD (bip32) tree which we control?\n\n> You can actually prove to yourself that we cannot know the private key. The process for this verification can only be done after the unit is unsealed, and requires a verbatim copy of the original data written. Plus, you\'ll need to precisely control what is written to the drive, which cannot be done with higher-level commands to load entropy (so drag-n-drop will not work).\n\n> In summary, the process is as follows: take a new Opendime, power it up and precisely write 256k of known bytes to it (ie. use dd to write it starting at block zero). The unit will pick a private key as normal. Unseal the Opendime (break the tab), and run the file advanced/rngverify.py with Python. That file is a simple program that contains the (previous) unknown entropy value from the Opendime, and it checks that your entropy is hashed into the secret key. In fact, it re-creates the entire key-picking process and demonstrates we used exactly that process. Because it\'s just a few lines of python, it\'s very easy to audit.\n\n>As you will see, the secret exponent of the private key is the double-SHA256 of these values concatenated: (the 256k bytes from you) + (128-bit serial number of the Opendime in base32) + (32-byte nonce picked by Opendime\'s RNG).': 3, "I'd like to know too.

Why all the obvious 419 scam level nonsense? Why the career suicide?\n\nThat's what i am trying to figure. I don't pretend to have the final explanation, but this reminds me very much of the [bizarre career suicide of Truecrypt](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/30/encryption-software-truecrypt-closes-doors) where the core developers litterally discredited themselves and started criticizing the project because they couldn't reveal that they were under a gag order and national security letter and forced to implement backdoors by some three letter agency to make Truecrypt unsecure.\n\nIf Gavin had been compromised and risked being prosecuted for treason for revealing it, what would be his options other than litterally shooting himself in the foot for an apparently unrelated reason? \n\nI'm not claiming this is the case here. But that's an hypothesis that could explain some of what we are seing. Either way, I believe that the truth is much more subtle than what it seems to be and we should start reading between the lines instead of going first degree and mobbing around this bizarre absurd and strangely insistant hoax.": 2, 'So Ian Grigg and JVP are part of the scam and have possibly helping CW with it for almost a year.': 3, 'Seems like we\'ve been bombarded with posts all day trying to put forward the idea that this post is presenting. That what\'s happened is so far fetched that it must actually lead us to think he is Satoshi. It\'s idiotic how many people are posting stuff meant to sow doubts about the plain and simple logical soundness behind "no signing means no proof". We keep getting this reverse psychology theme that because he\'s not giving proof that actually means he\'s Satoshi. I can only assume that somebody, oh who could it be, has mounted a campaign to hammer on this theme here.': 6, 'I think Dr. CSW is very possibly Satoshi. Too many independent confirming reports to be a con. Too weird and too many years in the making to be made up.': -5, 'I think that no proof alone would be just that.

If the original Satoshi allows more people in the secret over time these people become Satoshi too until we are all Satoshi.\n\nNow if you are asking if I would believe the statement to be true just because it was signed by Satoshi, the answer would be no. I have no reason to think Satoshi would necessarily tell the truth. Now given your specific statememt, if I can establish the endorsement of the statement both ways i.e. Satoshi claiming to be Donald Trump and Donald Trump claiming to be Satoshi, I would believe that indeed from now Donald Trump is indeed Satoshi either originally or through a bilateral agreement to transfer the persona to Trump.\n\nBut how does that relate to my post?': 2, "The Craig Wright twitter account reveals more:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Dr_Craig_wright\n\nIts being managed by Uyen Nguyen who was there from the start. \n\nShe names Grigg and JVP directly, says she met them in person back in Sep 2015 as they knew the shitstorm was coming for them.

But if what he wanted is that it is **conjectured** and eventually **rejected** that he is Satoshi then he wouldn't want to provide any definitive proof.\n\nI am not saying I believe Wright is actually Satoshi, but I have to admit that if we try to integrate Gavin, Grigg and Matonis' career suicide in the picture things don't really add up anymore to point to a plain obvious hoax and we must be looking at something far more subtle that could include Wright deliberately ruining his own claims.

Then I thought about Gavin and how he could have fallen for that complete nonsense and why he wasn't even defending himself. And then I looked at Jon Matonis and Ian Grigg. And I saw the same thing. They seem absurdly content to let their reputation burn in flame. This is the most bizarre thing of the whole story.\n\nDon't take my word. Just look at their reaction since the story started.

That makes for one more moving part in the story but doesn't make things any less absurd\n\nI am not ininterest going head down in wherever the script writers of this act wants us to go next.\n\nWhat I am interested in is why Gavin, Jon Matonis and Ian Grigg seem content to let their reputation burn in flames without doing anything to do damage control.\n\nWhat's in it for them? ls destroying their reputation, relevance and influence in the Bitcoin ecosystem precisely the outcome that they were trying to achieve?

(Bitcoin core pre-generates another 50 or so change key pairs, but if you send many transactions your old backup won\'t contain newly generated change addresses).  These can optionally be protected with a pass**word** (+/- BIP 38 protection)\n\nFor this reason some early wallets like Electrum and Armory went with Hierarchical Deterministic key generation.  Random entropy is used to create a single random "seed" which is then converted to a strong of words (12-24) called the mnemonic seed.\n\nLater the seed -> mnemonic process was standardized, as were the mnemonic to HD address tree derivation and optional pass**phrase**. [BIP 32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki#master-key-generation), BIP 39, BIP 44\n\nThese have the advantage that it is reliable for humans to backup 12-24 words (the dictionary of possible words is chosen such that only the first 4 letters are required) and all present and future (change or otherwise) addresses can be recovered with this one backup. For example a payment processor can generate a new receiving address (pub/priv key pair) for each transaction.\n\nThe wallets that support the BIP 32/39/44 standard include mycelium, MultibitHD, Trezor , Ledger, KeepKey.\n\nSome wallets use a different incompatible  derivation like Armory/electrum/breadwallet.\n\n>The private key is used to unlock my wallet, correct?\n\nThe private key is needed to sign transactions. A bitcoin transaction from Alice to Bob contains Unspent Transaction Inputs (UTXOs) - this information is freely available to any wallet from blockchain data. A valid transaction signature is required to send bitcoin.\n\n>If the Bitcoin address + private key = my wallet, does that mean that my balance information is somehow stored\n\nThe blockchain contains all bitcoin transactions. There are no totals, so in order for a full node to determine how much Alice\'s balance is, it adds up all UTXOs (and back validates their transaction history)\n\n>Can I attach a passphrase to my private key, a la PGP?\n\nBitcoin core let\'s you password protect your wallet. Multibit let\'s you password protect individual wallets. Electrum let\'s you password protect your electrum mnemonic. BIP 38 let\'s you encrypt a single private key.\n\nModern BIP 32/39/44 wallets generally support a [pass**phrase**](https://doc.satoshilabs.com/trezor-user/advanced_settings.html#using-passphrase-encrypted-seeds) which modifies the mnemonic seed, giving an entirely different HD tree.\n\n>How can I generate a new address from my private key\n\nHD wallets have an xpub from which all public keys can be derived (there is a matching xpriv). This allows a payment processor for example to store their xpub of their webserver, without risk of a hacker stealing their funds (because only the hardware wallet knows the private key/s)': 2, "I was a bit concerned about Airbitz.

A couple of great resources::\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgo7FCCPuylVk4luP3JAgVw\n\nAnd there\'s a ton of tutorials, I would probably also recommend reading either::\n\nBitcoin for the befuddled\nor\nMastering Bitcoin\n\nBoth are excellent and can be found online.\n\nAs for bitaddress.org questions:\n\n1)  The private keys provide the proof that you have been given control of a UTXO (ala bitcoin).  That\'s weird - to be honest...  You never \'own\' a bitcoin - like a dollar (assuming you are in the US).  What I mean, you can open up your wallet and physically take out a note - you \'own\' that.  In Bitcoin, you simply have the rights of control over some amount of coin.  You can transfer (spend) that control to another address.  But you never \'own\' them - they live within the Blockchain.  That\'s actually great - for a number of reasons.\n\n2)  The term \'wallet\' is a terrible one - that has unfortunately stuck.  Wallets ought to be called client software or Experiencing the Blockchain really.  But one\'s wallet typically contains your privKeys that can be used to show control of bitcoin - so that you can spend.  They also create addresses that allow others to \'pay\' you.  Again, the wallet really is a window that allows you to interact or experience the Blockchain.  All the information and all the bitcoin lives there. \n\n3)  on bitaddress.org - under paper wallet, there is a radio button called "BIP 38 Encrypt?".  This allows you to encrypt your privKeys with a password.  This is a great practice - as it allows you security, even if your paper wallet is found by someone else.  \n\nWhen making paperwallets - it really isn\'t like wallets in real life.  What I mean, you probably have a wallet - and you put value in it.  Here, paperwallets, are really key pairs that can be used to digitally sign / prove ownership of value for movement reasons.  One security model is therefore, have a LOT of paperwallets, and only put a small amount of coin in each.  Now an attacker has to spend X work on one pair, and the same amount of work for the next.  Basically, you have made the payoff for stealing from you - not worth it...\n\n4)  Different addresses for each transaction - yes.  But not really for privacy purpose (I guess).  The reason that I would instead point towards - when you spend, you must ineffect put your Public Key on the Blockchain.  Addresses are not public keys, rather a hash function of them.  But when you put a public key - then it is potentially open to quantum computer attack in the future - as one could (maybe) back compute the privKey and spend out of that any remaining coin.  So one should probably use a different change address.  Oh - yeah, all bitcoin in a UTXO must be depleted in a transaction... But you\'ll read about that.\n\nAs for the how - again, one\'s software will take care of this.  So my recommendation::\n\nA)  Have a wallet on your phone, and put inside the same amount that you\'d feel comfortable if it were your real wallet.  This is your hot wallet - the one that you spend out of.\n\nB)  The remaining amount you create from an air gap\'ed computer (rPi e.g.) many, many, many paperwallets (BIP38 encrypted) - putting in some amount X.  If you need access of this amount in the future - you can then sweep this amount in by having your smart phone wallet scan the qr code of the privKey and entering the password.': 2, 'ELECTRUM': 3, "Cannot stress enough - offline / air gapped computer.   \n\nIf you have a raspberry pi, then this is the least troublesome approach (my opinion).  As you can setup you rPi software-wise, make sure it can print (USB), and has other helpful softwares installed (veracryt -sp). It is here that I then image the card, so that in the future I can start at this point my upgrading.\n\nThen reboot without Internet/WiFi/etc.  make your keys, print (at least two copies), and make a set, save the addresses to usb, privKey only if the stick is encrypted.  \n\nThen you just need to remove you sd card.  Either tape it, so you don't accidentally use and store - or destroy.  If you get one for ~5 bucks and your can't store easy, then perhaps cut and throw.

Opinion is divided over whether he really is Satoshi. Some experts were persuaded; others are unsure and indeed even he now seems less convinced about jumping into the limelight. What I want to know, however, is how we can be sure he is the real Craig Steven Wright.\n\nThere are, after all, inconsistencies in his story. Mr Wright \xe2\x80\x94 or is it Mr Steven Wright, no one seems sure \xe2\x80\x94 is described as a Sydney businessman and computer scientist. And yet the real Craig Steven Wright apparently comes from Brisbane. Late last year someone calling himself Craig Steven Wright denied being Satoshi and yet, just a few months later he insists that he is. The latest claimant to the mantle of Craig Steven Wright says that he just wants to be \xe2\x80\x9cleft alone\xe2\x80\x9d, but reliable sources say that a man using the same name and answering to a very similar physical description hired a team of public relations gurus to stage manage his revelation.\n\n\nThe bitcoin community is divided. Some say that the real Craig Steven Wright actually spells Steven with a \xe2\x80\x9cPH\xe2\x80\x9d. Others have taken to Reddit to post detailed debunking. One subreddit noted that the real Craig Steven Wright could easily prove his identity by sending out an email with his original Hotmail account. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he is the real CSW he would still have his Hotmail password and could just send his friends an email saying that his was the real CSW,\xe2\x80\x9d said one. The man claiming to be Mr Wright (or Mr Steven Wright) insists that he has forgotten the password since it is over 10 years since he used Hotmail and that his account has been deactivated. But sceptics says the real CSW would not have let his account lapse.\n\nSome suggested he could prove his identity by producing the cryptographic key to his first home in Brisbane. Mr Wright says he handed over the keys when he moved out but in any case he could have had a spare cryptographic key cut at the shoe repairers. Or Craig Steven Wright may be a chatbot built by Microsoft to wind up people on Twitter.\n\nBut some are convinced. Journalists from the BBC, GQ and the Economist said they had seen a Blockbuster movies membership card from 2002 with his name on it and an unreturned DVD of the The Manchurian Candidate. The Economist did note there were things that were unproven. For example the man did not recall the address of the Blockbuster store and it is well known that the real CSW did not like Frank Sinatra. GQ added that the real Craig Wright would have preferred the remake with Denzel Washington.\n\nSupporters say that since the real Craig Steven Wright is being investigated by the Australian tax authorities, there is little reason to pretend to be him. On the other hand since the real CSW may be Satoshi Nakamoto and sitting on 45m bitcoin perhaps there is an incentive after all. Then there are those who believe that Craig Steven Wright is indeed CSW but doubt that he is also Satoshi. Then again, his name is a perfect anagram of Satoshi Nakamoto, if you remove C, G, E, P, W, H and two Rs\xe2\x80\x89and add two Os, two As, an S, K and\xe2\x80\x89M.\n\nThis dilemma is one we may come to face in the future. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean that we will all have to prove we are Craig Steven Wright. I\xe2\x80\x99m certainly not, although there are those on Reddit who point out that the real Craig Steven Wright would deny it at first. No, the issue is proving we are who we say we are at a time when automation, hacking and identity theft are leaving us ever exposed to such challenges. When anyone can use your name on social media or email, how do you prove you are the real you? When hackers can steal your credit card and bank details will it become more difficult to persuade a robo-banker that you do own your account?\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend these issues are insurmountable; they clearly aren\xe2\x80\x99t. But with increased automation the identity requirements must become more demanding. Will I need a DNA sample or retinal scan to verify my bank account in extremis?\nSo how does the man calling himself Craig Steven Wright prove he is CSW and not a hoaxer? It\xe2\x80\x99s tricky. If only there was some technology; a kind of public ledger or \xe2\x80\x94 oh I don\xe2\x80\x99t know \xe2\x80\x94 a blockchain, by which independent sources could verify he is who he says.": 4}, ('Inside the Secret Meeting Where Wall Street Tested Digital Cash', 4): {}, ('Are there any wallets w/ no $$$ deposit limits?', 0): {'Deposit or exchange?

Very little of what occurred in that room (and privately) has been divulged by Gavin. (Same goes for w/Matonis and the three media outlets). Either because of the NDA, because of the debacle of Wright reneging, or for personal reasons. I have a feeling at some point an exact breakdown of what occurred in Gavin\'s verification meeting with Wright will come out - NDA or not. \n\n>Do you honestly think that when you go to a magic show that the illusionist on stage has at least a little bit of real magic?\n\nOf course not. And this is in invalid comparison. If I go to a magic show, it\'s to be entertained - because I know that "magic" is **impossible**. Fun to watch, and on occasion impressive, but I know that things are being stage managed, there\'s an entire apparatus supporting the illusionists feats, and I might theorize on how he performed a certain trick, but I know the entire spectacle is based on something scientifically impossible. Cryptographic signatures & validation **are not scientifically impossible**. That said - even having possession of the key(s) and being able to sign a provided message doesn\'t mean Wright = Satoshi.

What else was discussed and shown to Gavin in private that he\'s so far refused to disclose but has indicated it also lent to his certainty? That\'s also important. \n\nIt\'s unfair to come down on Gavin as being an idiot and to make other definitive statements when we were not privy to what took place.

If there is a lot they have to hide of others, maybe because it\'s humiliating (in their own eyes), the more they try to impersonate an ideal-self in front of others - some even in front the own family/woman/children etc. That\'s something that leads into psychological-isolation (not necessarily physical lonliness). And if the intensity increases, and it\'s suffering, it can lead into overreactions. And overreactions are destructive and/or self-destructive. What CSW did so far was both.

Those failures make it clear that in time, Gavin will be completely irrelevant.\n\nIf Gavin wishes to salvage his relevance it will require something drastic.  Desperate times accordingly resulted in desperate measures.

And it perfectly and reasonably explains the behavior.  The real bitch of all of this is that it only took about 90 minutes for the fake signature to be determined a forgery.  That was not enough time for the hopeful belief that Wright is Satoshi to even propagate (people form strong biases around initial impressions).  Accordingly, before the idea could even take hold, it was debunked and Gavin was hastily forced to decide how to respond.\n\nHad his decision simply been \xe2\x80\x9cDo I still believe Wright is Satoshi?\xe2\x80\x9d the answer would easily have been, \xe2\x80\x9cI have my doubts.\xe2\x80\x9d  But Gavin\xe2\x80\x99s actual decision was \xe2\x80\x9cShould I stick with my story, or should I give up on regaining my relevance?\xe2\x80\x9d  That\xe2\x80\x99s where he made the mistake.

But it\xe2\x80\x99s actually quite simple when you see it.\n\nFor some time now, Gavin has been drifting into irrelevance. And being the Bitcoin guy THE thing Gavin has to distinguish himself.  This distinction has, for the last several years, landed him the best seat in the house and a cushy job that requires little actual work. Those are surely in jeopardy if he can't pull off some miracle to make himself relevant again.  The XT fail was bad.  The Classic fail was worse.  Those failures make it clear that in time, Gavin will be completely irrelevant.\n\nIf Gavin wishes to salvage his relevance it will require something drastic.  Desperate times accordingly resulted in desperate measures.  If no one would have re-formatted the signature and searched it on the blockchain then Wright would have a lot of people believing he is Satoshi right now.  And Gavin would have a lot of people believing Satoshi whole-heartedly backs Gavin.  It\xe2\x80\x99s fairly risky to hope no one will find that signature, but it\xe2\x80\x99s not far-fetched that they will not.  It is definitely a \xe2\x80\x9cHail Mary\xe2\x80\x9d type move, but Gavin has quite a bit at stake, and the agony of defeat is looming.\n\nThat is the motive.  And it perfectly and reasonably explains the behavior.  The real bitch of all of this is that it only took about 90 minutes for the fake signature to be determined a forgery.  That was not enough time for the hopeful belief that Wright is Satoshi to even propagate (people form strong biases around initial impressions).  Accordingly, before the idea could even take hold, it was debunked and Gavin was hastily forced to decide how to respond.\n\nHad his decision simply been \xe2\x80\x9cDo I still believe Wright is Satoshi?\xe2\x80\x9d the answer would easily have been, \xe2\x80\x9cI have my doubts.\xe2\x80\x9d  But Gavin\xe2\x80\x99s actual decision was \xe2\x80\x9cShould I stick with my story, or should I give up on regaining my relevance?\xe2\x80\x9d  That\xe2\x80\x99s where he made the mistake.  He did not realize that sticking with his story was not a real option.  He did not realize that there was absolutely no way to still convince people.

So he told some people out of his own milieu that he is Satoshi (but "psssst, don\'t tell any one") and that he is sitting on > 1 Mio BTC, but locked in a trust (Tulip). They help him now with money, they will get it back later - and more. Who wouldn\'t like to know the secret of a legend and help this hero - plus: get it back later and much more? The more people he told this story, the more evidence he needed. So he doctored blogposts, mails etc. It\'s kind of a natural development out of the first stories about "I\'m Satoshi, but psssst" (maybe not even for money but like a boy tries to impress a girl with a hero-fairytale) to a huge story built on many lies to defend the lies before, to doctored material, to leaking it to the press, etc. Something like that can lead into a weird and self-supporting dynamic. There is always the need to build more on top to not get outed. It becomes also a psychological dynamic, like "self-hypnotizing". It\'s as if somebody believes in the own lies, becomes the person he tries to imitate. And Satoshi is a projection. It\'s possible to mix the own believe of "nobody knows, but I\'m a genius" and the own personality with imaginations about "how could Satoshi really be?" and public informations about him. Such a psychological dynamic can be much more complex and self-supporting than many would believe. But: If you build lie on lie, you will need more and more convincing stuff. His masterpiece was to convince Bitcoin-VIP\'s, maybe he even hoped that would give him the final peace. But it wasn\'t possible to give proof to the public. And now it\'s again about the tulip-trust which I believe, never existed. If I\'m right with my theory: A lot of people gave him money because they believed his story. Most likely people near to him. Gavin Andresen and John Matonis were not the targets. He needed them to convince. If you convince Gavin Andresen and he says "Yes, I believe him" it\'s enough to convince those you owe money. But... it\'s much harder now and I would make a bet, he gets a lot of mails and phone calls, a lot of questions if the tulip trust exists, if he ever will be able to pay back etc. \n\nJust a theory, maybe totally wrong.

And I suspect you\'ll agree, if work is what you want, there are a few other Bitcoin developers you would much prefer (Wuille in particular, but most of the Blockstream guys, including contractor Luke-Jr).\n\nPretty soon Gavin is looking at losing those offers of equity stakes just to be an "advisor" to some Bitcoin company.

As soon as it was realized that the Lightning Network was a more viable and feasible alternative he began trying to claw his way back into relevance, doing anything and everything he can to stop its implementation.  Why?  Gavin is one of those guys that doesn\'t like the idea of Bitcoin being ungovernable (if Bitcoin is governable, we can stop all crime, yada, yada).  His chosen method of scaling is simply pretext for making Bitcoin governable\xe2\x80\x94a practically inevitable path until the lighting network was conceived.': 3, 'Almost all analysis of the actual implementation by everyone is that the choices Satoshi [made] (http://www.righto.com/2014/02/bitcoins-hard-way-using-raw-bitcoin.html) implementing the white paper are anything but elegant.

Also it's incredibly easy to find loads of his stuff on the internet that completely discredits the idea that he is satoshi. The best con man ever would have never tried to pull such a stunt with so much obvious contradictory evidence lying around on the internet. Yes he had put a lot of work in to this scam but not nearly enough and in the grand schemes of impressive cons, this one doesn't even warrant the top 100 let alone the top ten.": 2, 'Gavin who?': 1, 'I believe it\'s more a psychological dynamic (drama), that it began with some kind of "imagination" like 12 year olds dreaming about being a super-hero or whatever. Wright could fit into that because there are signs that he sees himself as a misunderstood genius. He also shows some will to let the world know that, he shows vanity and craving for being recognized how he would like to see himself (an idealized self). That would explain why people around him seem to believe he is Satoshi. It would simply be because it could have started like *"Hey, I never told you but I have a secret. It\'s so hard to be the only one who knows, but did you ever hear about Bitcoin? I\'m the creator... but please, never tell anybody."* (of course, more complex in reality and just speculation). The thing is: Something like that can grow and it isn\'t just a simple lie. It has impact on the own personality. It\'s as if somebody forgets sometimes that it\'s a lie which leads into a behavior (reactions on questions for example) that seems very consistent - because it is psychological consistent. It\'s hard to explain why, but we all play roles in different situations. The more intense those situations are the more we believe a role is real. It\'s not even unnormal regarding the principle. The difference is more about intensity and how separated a role is from our "day-self" (how we are in a normal situation). Regarding Satoshi the separation is part of the reality, separation is part of the role. What I try to say is: Even those aspects that are not consistent can be used to let it seem even more real. Satoshi is not perfect? Who would expect him to be... he is just a human, right? Satoshi has tax-problems, has a more or less shady past? Why should he be perfect. He acts like being mad/stupid/irrational? Genius and insanity go hand in hand. psychologically broken? Who wouldn\'t believe it after years of hiding parts of his life? Satoshi is nearly perfect as a projection-base because it\'s not just possible to project weaknesses in it.

But mining is not an endeavor to find *any* hash. It's an endeavor to find a *specific subset of hashes*.\n\nIf there was some guarantee that for all Merkle roots, there exists a nonce that satisfies this subset criteria, then we could naively argue that mining was deterministic in the sense that once the miners chose their initial nonce (lets say all miners have a different initial seed, but the same root) the race had already been won by someone - we just don't know who that is. If this was true, faster block times (as seen in litecoin) might actually increase security.\n\nThe reality is, however, that it is possible that for a given Merkle root, there is no nonce that satisfies the block difficulty. When I say nonce, I mean nonce in combination with any other bits (such as time), that the miners step through.\n\nSo the winner of the mining race cannot be deterministic for a given Merkle root, because there exists the possibility that no solution exists.\n\nThe context for this thinking was when litecoin was first introduced. There were augments as to how to compare the security between bitcoin and litecoin. I was troubled for a short period because I heard the proposition that litecoin would be more secure (if equal in POW hashing power), due to its faster block time. This would only be true if, for instance, miners were trying to find a nonce to solve a specific Merkle root, but this is not true.

After spending more time on the problem, I realized that this deterministic view is flawed... it is possible that everybody is working on Merkle root that has no hash that satisfies the block difficulty.\n\nWith magnetic states, the nice thing about them is that you can test them over and over and string the tests together, even those in which no state transition was observed, as if they had been one continuous test. This is frequently how the lifetime of a magnetic particle is measured (fitted to an Arrhenius equation) to extract an energy barrier. In an analogous fashion, the proof of work can be strung together and all of the previous attempted hashes - even by miners who lost the race, accumulate in the proof of work.\n\nIf mining was not a Poisson process, mining would be deterministic and the largest single miner, even if they were 1% of the network, could launch a "51% attach" (it would actually be a "largest miner" attack).': 1, 'One has to wonder if some of these other authors contributed to Bitcoin.': 0, 'Also, they are working with bits...

In December 2015 it was Mr Wright\xe2\x80\x99s turn to be outed: hackers leaked some of his e-mails and documents. But holes soon started to appear in that story, too. SGI, a maker of supercomputers, for instance, denied that it had ever done business with one of his firms, Cloudcroft. After a raid by Australian tax officials on his house in Sydney, many came to believe that the entire story was an elaborate hoax, perhaps one staged by Mr Wright himself.\n\nSoon afterwards Mr Wright moved to London, where one of his companies has an office, but kept silent\xe2\x80\x94until late March, when his public-relations agency contacted three media outlets, including The Economist, saying that Mr Wright wanted to refute claims that he had made the story up and to offer cryptographic proof that he is indeed Mr Nakamoto. Although he gave us a demonstration that seemed to show that he is in possession of cryptographic keys which only Mr Nakamoto should have, important questions remained. In particular, Mr Wright was unwilling to use his keys to sign digitally a message provided by us, which would have been stronger, although not absolutely watertight, evidence that he is Mr Nakamoto.\n\nOthers were convinced by his claim, however. Gavin Andresen, Mr Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x99s successor as the leading developer of bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s software, confirmed in an interview that he had met Mr Wright and thought his proof was valid\xe2\x80\x94an endorsement that lent credence to his claim.\n\nBlog jam\nThis week Mr Wright published a blog post which he had promised would not only describe the proof in detail, but also provide data to allow it to be independently verified. But the post turned out to be an exercise in obfuscation: he laid out a very complicated way of proving his identity and provided as cryptographic proof a string of numbers that is publicly available.\n\nThis bungled self-outing provoked head-shaking among bitcoin gurus: if Mr Wright was indeed Mr Nakamoto, surely he could provide more convincing evidence? Mr Andresen, too, was flabbergasted by the blog post and later said that it was a mistake to endorse Mr Wright\xe2\x80\x99s claim before reading it.\n\nFaced with much ridicule, Mr Wright backed out. \xe2\x80\x9cI believed that I could do this,\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote in a new post. \xe2\x80\x9cI believed that I could put the years of anonymity and hiding behind me. But, as the events this week unfolded and I prepared to publish the proof of access to the earliest keys, I broke.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe most obvious explanation for Mr Wright\xe2\x80\x99s erratic behaviour is that he is indeed an imposter\xe2\x80\x94and does not have the access to Mr Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x99s keys. But things may be more complicated. One theory holds that Mr Wright was only one of a group of inventors of bitcoin. Ian Grigg, another bitcoin expert, recently wrote: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is true that Craig is the larger part of the genius behind the team, but he could not have done it alone.\xe2\x80\x9d Two possible members of that team, Hal Finney and Dave Kleiman, have died.\n\nIn other words, the Satoshi saga will go on. In the meantime the bitcoin community remains divided community into two competing camps with different views about how the currency should evolve. One side wants to keep it smallish and pure; the other is pushing for it to grow rapidly, even if this means turning it into something more like a conventional payment system. The controversy has dragged on for months because bitcoin lacks institutions to reach and impose a decision.\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9ccivil war\xe2\x80\x9d, as some call it, has already slowed bitcoin down, says Jeff Garzik, another influential developer and co-founder of Bloq, a bitcoin startup. If the strife continues, another cryptocurrency may well supersede bitcoin\xe2\x80\x94in which case the effort to establish Satoshi\xe2\x80\x99s true identity will become academic.': 6, 'One of the best publications out there; always classy.': 2, 'paywall anyone got the full article?\n': 3, "Also, I don't see to which people is referred to with those 'that want to keep it smallish and pure' ?

If you want to know more about Dave, you should talk to the SANS folks.\n\n>One of the top SANS people is also having a conference in Las Vegas in September, where the Trustee of the Tulip Trust is expected to appear.\n\nOk, so here\'s what I\'ve pieced together of the story that\'s being drawn for us. keep in mind, none of it is likely true, but I think its important to understand the narrative that is being painted with this "evidence".\n\n1. There\'s some kind of trust that was created that handed over control of 1.1 million bitcoins to David Klieman. \n* At least 100000 of these bitcoins are required to be returned to Wright by 2020. Wright can also barrow funds from the trust. \n\n1. Wright is likely the beneficiary of the trust. While David Kleiman was the trustee of the trust, who was in charge of securing the 1.1 million bitcoins. \n1. David also appointed someone else, as co-trustee that only he knew the identity of.\n1. This anonymous co-trustee could act as trustee in some way as well. \n1. 7 keys were created for this trust, only three were needed for access.\n1.   it\'s likely that both trustees had access to these keys or could gain access, While Wright does not have access to these keys.\n1. Control of the trust was supposed to revert to Wright upon Dave\'s death. The implementation of this would likely be handled by the co-trustee.\n1. Dave dies...So control was either given back to Wright, or it was now in the hands of the anonymous co-trustee.\n1. However, it appears from this article that the co-trustee is known by Wright/Joseph VaughnPerling and is apparently a "She" \n1.  She will be at a conference this coming September and may possibly be one of the three female presenters listed on the conference website: https://www.sans.org/event/network-security-2016/instructors/the-core-group \n\nThe following is a message posted by Joseph VaughnPerling addressed to the co-trustee:\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cThe Tulip Trading Trust trustee, appointed by Dave Kleiman as of Oct 12nd 2012. It has been rumored that Craig Wright will need to access Tulip Trading Trust assets. Trustee acts in the interest of the beneficiary alone and must defend against undue influence by others. In order to authorize movements of trust assets the beneficiary must come forward and make a direct request of the trustee our way\xe2\x80\x93NOT via 3rd party nor any intermediaries. Any coin movement affecting the trust asset without prior authorization will be considered a trust violation and invalid irrespective of any claim of constructive bailment. The Trust alone has control over its assets. Tampering or manipulating with trust assets by anyone (including the beneficiary) might have material legal and tax implications. Beneficiaries are invited to a conference call 12:00 UTC Friday to discuss interests. Principals only.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe implications of this message are as follows:\n1. * Wright doesn\'t have the keys, the co-trustee has the keys\n1.  Wright wants access to the keys, but the co-trustee is obligated to withhold them from him until 2020\n1. therefore, Wright can still make a loan of some kind, that the co trustee could authorize to move funds to his account (possibly even from a specific block ie genesis block funds).\n1. Wright could also claim sovereignty of the trust, since it is supposed to revert to his control upon Kliemans death.  \n\nIn any case, if all of this is true, there is some kind of power struggle happening behind the scenes surrounding this trust, Wright, the co-trustee, and the beneficiaries of the trust, who could be more than the just wright. \n\nAlso its possible to expect something early Friday morning Eastern time, since the conference call between the beneficiaries is supposed to happen at that time.\n\nBut it may be possible that a woman is in control of satoshi\'s keys. cool. and possibly one of these three woman: \nhttps://www.sans.org/event/network-security-2016/instructors/alissa-torres\nhttps://www.sans.org/event/network-security-2016/instructors/heather-mahalik\nhttps://www.sans.org/event/network-security-2016/instructors/sarah-edwards\n\noh, also, its 5000$ to attend one of these events taught be any of these woman. each.\n\n\n\nThis was just me going down the rabbit hole, none of it should be taken as fact. but its possible.': 3, 'Trolling?
