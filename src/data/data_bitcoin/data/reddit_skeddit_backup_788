When the dollar deflates, normally not all currencies deflate along with it. But (I just checked) the graphs of BTC versus other major currencies look very similar -- it's not true that, say, BTC is holding up fine versus the Euro or the Yuan. So unless you're imagining a global deflation, I don't see how this can be right.": 1, 'if you think of deflation as "desire for dollars growing" compared to inflation as "desire for dollars shrinking"  wouldn\'t you say you value dollars more today than you did 6 months ago??? \n\n6 months ago I was taking every dollar of profit and putting it into silver and bitcoin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,but now that I have some of that I am starting to see panic,  people are calling me and selling me silver that they bought at 22 bucks for 16 bucks.   They suddenly need cash for this or that.  \n\nDeflation is scary because it is exponential and contagious.  \n\nThe economy gets worse, more people get stuck, and have to sell at the bottom,   all the weak hands get pushed out of a good investment.  \n\nThe smart money buys it all up (not trying to call myself smart, just making a case) and profits a bit down the road as the FED reacts to the threat of deflation with massive money printing, leading back to increased velocity of money and inflation.  \n\nUnless this Xmas season is the best for retailers in 10 years I think we will see more and more "deflation risk" popping up with a final reaction by the FED of QEinfinity with printing that dwarfs what has happened so far.  \n\nby next summer we really have only two choices........a good economy gaining traction.........or more money printing.   There is no middle.  \n\n\nso we will see....maybe I am a weak hand and I will have to sell that silver I got at 16 for even less..........time will tell if I can survive long enough to see a payday on silver or bitcoin.   My point is that 6 months ago I didn\'t want to own even a single dollar............but all of the sudden I see that dollars are suddenly in high demand..........and with a few of these dollars I can suck up cheap stuff.    This was not the situation a few months back.  \n\nso wouldn\'t you say that people being forced to sell at a loss on something like silver is the weak hands getting taken out................and that once the weak hands are all gone the following move should be up.   It\'s the weak holders who have to sell low that keep the price ticking down,  and the paper products make the pain hard to handle.  Everyday it\'s lower,  and everyday more weak hands sell off to stop the pain.  \n\nit can\'t do this for ever,,,,,,,,,,and I would say it can\'t do this for long.    The whole point is that as these desperate people fold, they do so under demand for dollars in a market where there are less and less dollars to be found...........and that is deflation.  \n\nI would say this is because all the banks are taking money but not loaning it out,,,,,,,the money has been printed, but it didn\'t hit the street.   The banks see the demand for dollars going up so they want to hold on to it,  plus they got it an near zero interest so why loan it out to people who will most likely fail.  They may as well just keep it. Let the pain get real bad,  and then buy up cheap stuff with free money, from people who are desperate only because they made them so by not lending out the money the FED printed to increase velocity and float.   \n\nJust watch the banks,  all the sudden they will cut loose and start buying up half priced assets from desperate people.  That will mark the bottom.    To get back to bitcoin,  6 months ago I had dollars that I hated, and wanted to get rid of so I bought bitcoin,  this month I have dollars to spend also,,,,,but I hate them a bit less.  I\'ll buy bitcoin but only at 350,  and silver at 16.  that low price is what it takes to get my money out of my pockets and into the game.   The perception change is one reason bitcoin is lower,  nothing bad happened to bitcoin it\'s just the competition for dollars is more and more competitive so people value them more this month than they did a few months back.    \n\nI have a few grand in cash,  something I would not have dreamed of 6 months ago.   \n\nThis "feeling" is the root of deflation.  \n': 1, 'Great Britain Pound (Sterling)': 1, "At this price, I'm already looking at 100 times gains.

That puts gold at about 8,000.  They could also print money, and create money supply.   So if we are in a deflation that would explain why people are not willing to trade dollars for bitcoins.  There is more and more competition for the fewer and fewer dollars. Velocity is slowing down.

Some will find the information valuable while others will not. Currently, when someone graces the internet with some notably clever, insightful, or otherwise helpful wisdom, they usually get crowned with thousands of upvotes .. which incidentally are worth exactly zero..other than some warm and fuzzies. The few exceptional of those will be gilded with gold (taking reddit as the current example) ... but many times there are plenty of other helpful posts that, though deserving of a little something extra than a up-arrow nod, receive nothing more.\n\nHere we have a payment medium that is perfect for microtransactions and I see a bunch of folks saying it\'s not a good idea. I say BS.

If you find value in a comment and want to say, hey thanks here\'s 3 cents for your tip jar, then so be it.

The result of that work must be something which could be checked easily as having uniquely occurred given the input conditions, otherwise you cannot verify it was done.\n\n2. The result must be incorporated into the block created, and verified by all nodes, not just miners.

Bitcoin users pay the fees and suffer the inflationary aspects of the reward, and from their perspective it is money wasted if not applied to network security.\n\nThere have been several external-work coins but they have not gained much footing.

But just as a few years ago when GPUs came online difficulty rose, and mining eventually became saturated, then difficulty plateaued and dropped. \n\nThe relationship between difficulty and mining power utilizes a feedback loop. When hashing becomes too fast the difficulty increases to slow it down. When difficulty becomes too high and unprofitable, miners drop out, cutting hash rate, which lowers difficulty again. \n\nShocks like new tech cause large disruptions but the long term trend is always towards minimal **acceptable** profit for miners, maximizing security for available tech and network cost.

Since then the chip die size has dropped a few times and ASICs are far faster, less power consuming then that first batch. \n\nMining can only be profitable long term for those with the best tech, lowest electric cost, and cheapest access to capital but disruptions can give opportunity to those quick to adjust, which is why so many are angry over scams like Butterfly Labs.": 3, "I believe that it does work efficiently, but maybe there is a possibility to solve different problems instead of the random (are they?) calculations done now.

Some tax professions will say to only use FIFO to be safe (ensuring you don't underpay owed taxes). But bitcoin is property, not stocks, so rules like lot-selection for selling and wash sales just aren't relevant.\n\nThe issue is really to do with their fungability and being able to track which coin you are selling and for what price. If you had all your coins in one wallet, but with differing cost basis, how do you know which one you are selling? It's an interesting problem, since most wallets don't let you pick the previous transaction inputs to spend.\n\nOne solution is to keep different wallets for different cost basis. That way you can clearly show that you are spending coins of a certain cost. But that isn't always practical, especially if you are buying/selling within an exchange account.\n\nSo that's the thing, if you were audited, you need to be able to show your workings and that you are tracking all the cost basis where you use a method other than FIFO.\n\nIt was one of the reasons for creating [https://bitcointaxes.info](https://bitcointaxes.info) to be able to track this.

So, in other words you would treat this the same as selling the 20 bitcoins for $, and use their appropriate cost basis (again can you use spec. ident. ?) and the $ value of the litecoin at the time of sale to determine the gain. This is how I reported it. \n\nI would then also assume you are starting a new cost basis in that litecion for the $ amount mentioned above (although in reality you only used bitcoin to purchase it). Anyone disagree with this?\n\nWhile still a bit confusing, it makes sense to me, but then if you trade portions of that litecoin back to bitcion, at different rates, keeping track of all these cost basis seems quite tedious.

I will keep this in mind for the future. But, I am sure there are a lot of people who simply bought all of their bitcoin on one exchange, and traded from that one account. \n\nIn this scenario, it seems a bit ridiculous to report using FIFO if you are buying and selling the same 10 coins, or that is your intent in other words ( in actuality, all of the coins are in cold storage). Since this is unclear at the moment, the safe move is obviously to use FIFO, but personally I will not do this as it does not actually reflect the substance of my trading, and it would create a **much** bigger tax liability owed than should actually be reflected. \n\nWhere do you draw the line? If I or a person in this scenario, had withdrawn the other 40 coins, would that have been sufficient evidence to prove you are re-selling the same 10 coins? I would assume it would eliminate the ambiguity. But yet, I don't see why you should have to withdraw these coins just to provide evidence for tax purposes if there is even a glimmer of a chance you wished to sell some or all of those coins. \n\nAgain, the IRS will eventually rule in what ever favor they please, so I don't disagree with your comment, only that such enormous precautions are justified for me *personally*.\n\n": 2, "Ah I see thanks, that makes sense and is my assumption, hadn't seen it discussed ever so thought I would put it out there. \n\n> It is also unclear if wash loss applies to btc but that may be relevant for some of your trades.\n\nYes, great point, that is another question of mine that I guess is still unclear.
