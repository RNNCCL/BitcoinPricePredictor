I'm going to use MultiBit to create this wallet and then store it onto a USB thumb drive for safe keeping. I'm also going to copy the contents of the USB drive onto multiple other USB drives so that my money is backed up in multiple locations. This way, if anything happens to one of my USB wallets, I can fall back on a copy that I made, and recover the bitcoins (BTC). Even though there are copies of my wallet files, they will all be updated to the real balance if any one of them is modified. This is because the private keys, once accessed with your password or pass phrase, within the Bitcoin network ultimately keep track of the money associated with them. This is why we can create this wallet offline, and allow the network to synchronize and verify that the funds that are supposed to be in our wallet appear. If necessary, we can send the funds from the USB stick to another wallet, either Online, Cloud, or Offline cold storage.\n\n> [*^MrJayBusch*](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCewY2_YBSU40wRoYrnAX6fw) ^in ^People ^& ^Blogs\n\n>*^18,621 ^views ^since ^Mar ^2014*\n\n[^bot ^info](http://www.reddit.com/r/youtubefactsbot/wiki/index)": 1, 'Multibit Classic\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qmOM567BF4': 1, 'Just load a Ledger wallet!': 0, "But don't I have to open a wallet and record a seed before I can load anything on Ledger?

(I think it\'s purpose at all is dubious because of the need for central control of keys which then makes it all hackable amongst other reasons.). \n\nHowever, a token of value has severe problems for banks.  \n\nFirstly, the tokens have to have real value derived from real markets from real people who aren\'t captured by banks. This for me is the highest beauty in Bitcoin. Since bitcoins are priced freely and accessed ad hoc, they are notions of desire not compulsion by "governors", and hence they are bedrock real.  A bank token, must meet this same bar or it\'s silly and hackable.  That is, the bank group offering the token must appeal to the markets as an altcoin.  Good luck with that one!  It might have legs for awhile but it won\'t stand up in time to an open standard with fixed money supply and a gazillion hashes with zero barrier to entry anywhere. \n\nSecondly, banks primary purpose and profit derives from their closed relationship with central banks.  A competing-with-fiat token from banks denecessitates central banks outright. Bitcoin proves concretely that central banks are not only not necessary, but that technology can put money creation beyond their enforcement.  A bank crypto coin kills central banks.  Credit expansion of arbitrary money supply by arbitrarily chosen banks and the variety of business opportunities and market timing opportunities available by knowing Janet Yellen\'s mind a priori is why we live in a 0.1% world. This privilege evaporates with a bank offered crypto coin. And a bank offered alt crypto coin must compete so must offer fixed money supply and no bank accounts.  It will never happen. \n\nThey won\'t be serving up golden goose sandwiches at market price of KFC Zingers any time soon. Can you imagine: "here is our coin, it\'s supply is determined by monthly committee meetings, it is available in accounts at the banks and in markets we control. It\'s as good as the dollar because it\'s backed by purveyors of violence (death by Bitcoin coin)."  Or:"here is our coin.

For the financial world, money and banking are synonymous. While the Bitcoin community has been insisting that bitcoin is money from the start, the larger banking community scoffed because the idea of a money divorced from a banking system was, to them, absurd.\n\nMoney is really just record keeping and bankers have understood this for hundreds of years. Ultimately, money is all just a matter of numbers in a ledger. The initial skepticism about bitcoin was rooted in the mistaken belief that bitcoins were somehow more akin to digital "things" that were acquiring speculative value, a kind of "digital gold" as it were (only lacking the "intrinsic value" of actual gold). They weren\'t enticed by the notion of bitcoin as money because they felt it was modeled after the wrong understanding of what money is.\n\nIn other words, they didn\'t understand that Bitcoin is ultimately just a global, decentralized, secure ledger. Put simply, Bitcoin is a bank, or perhaps more precisely a central bank -- a bank not controlled by anyone, but a bank nevertheless -- and "bitcoins" are  the units of record keeping utilized by this global decentralized bank in precisely the same way dollars are used as the units of record keeping by the US banking system. So contrary to being the speculative fancy of naive speculators who got their definition of money out of a text book and still think money should be made out of gold, Bitcoin actually is money according to bankers\' own definition of money.\n\nAt the end of the day, a bank\'s real function is to secure your money. Put differently, it is to secure and record the ledger being used by the public to track who owns what. Blockchains do the exact same thing, only better and without the need to trust an institution. Simply put, blockchains will make traditional banks obsolete in their primary function, and since all of their secondary functions, such as lending, derive from the power they get via their primary function of holding everyone\'s money, blockchains/sidechains will replace traditional banking altogether.

To any Bitcoin user out there, the difference is that they won\'t be paying miners in China for their transactions, they\'d be paying banks, for a service that could be infinitely superior.': -2, "The blockchain isn't actually an invention really. It's basically just a git master branch without any branching or merging. The real invention is using a limited and valuable token to incentivize playing by the rules and contributing to network security.\n\nWhen bitcoin was created it wasn't even certain that a token that existed on the internet and can't be inherently exchanged for anything could actually have value. It was good forethought to imagine that it could and you could almost say luck that Satoshi turned out to be right about it.\n\nIt's pretty cool how since we all know that it's possible today to bootstrap a coin from nothing that things like dogecoin and ethereum are even possible (which are both surprising for different reasons).": -1, 'Bitcoin': 1, 'They do have a term for that ;-)': 1, 'Well said.\n\nLet me repeat what\'s been said in earlier discussions on this topic: the fundamental distinguishing factor with a cartel-of-banks-blockchain is that you have fixed identities. This means that mining is unnecessary in as much as ledger updates can be signed. Irreversibility in that context is trivially achieved (but only by consensus!) with hashes. These two primitives - the digital signature and the cryptographic hash function - are decades old, they are nothing new. Call them a \'blockchain\' if you like, it\'s a bit like calling a go-kart a rocket ship.\n\nIt\'s interesting to note how the *radical openness* of something like Bitcoin enforces an ultra-sticky consensus precisely due to the anonymity and resultant freeness of entry into the system. Take the recent block size debate; enormous effort is required to change consensus in small ways, because we are a global network of unherdable cats :)\n\nBanks will have none of that (and I think proof of stake can suffer here too): 10 banks get together and make a system, everyone knows the participants and politics can start its magic to allow the most powerful to enforce actions (chain forks e.g.) on the weak. So even a "blockchain" will not enforce settlement finality for contracts that have existence outside the chain\'s logic.\n\nHaving said all that, I don\'t think there is *nothing* to the idea of using Bitcoin as an inspiration for an improvement to settlement networks; it\'s just that really all they\'re doing is waking up to cryptographic solutions they should have started using a decade or more ago.': 10, "Well, there we go.

Mainly, 'instant' blocks (as soon as a trusted signer sees a tx they can publish a block), scalability (big banks can support 1000TB blockchains), and no wasteful PoW mining.\n\nWith a trusted ledger, the fees can permanently be $0.00, since there is practically no cost to verifying tx's.  And if any signer screws up, they're kicked out of the consortium.  They can also update functionality and include things like the ethereum virtual machine without having to go through the slow and impossible process of updating Bitcoin core code.\n\nSo... yeah, we can ignore 'trusted ledgers' as nonsense... but banks have the ability to deploy them to the wider public and have billions of users worldwide within 24 months if they found the will to do it.  Nothing technically stopping them.   Bitcoin adoption cycle is much more difficult.  \n\nThe good news for anyone worried about trusted ledgers is that they don't stop Bitcoin from acting as a 'digital reserve currency'.. the benchmark base that people use worldwide for currency exchange, just as gold used to be for thousands of years.   \n\nI suspect in the future we will see a combination of both in the economy.": 2, "Only the historic transaction data needs to be stored immutably.

Not in the negative light as they do today. For example, we are on the verge of not needing banks. That level of control will slowly fade for most corporations. But we need the likes of Google. With or without countries. But the public already owns 51% of Google, so its not so bad.\n\nNew social systems become predominant only when there is need for them and existing structures can do nothing about it. After that power structures adapt, they acquiesce in order to continue existing. But the next social systems will be naturally decentralized. It leaves little room for a lot of the unnatural power structures that exist now.": 1, "We need a unique ID which is not forge-able and can't be stolen or coerced form an individual. We need a decentralized store of all unique ID's (without necessarily connecting that ID to a person to ensure privacy). We need some safeguard to ensure ID's cant be made public.\n\nFor example consider everyone on the planet voting on something. How can we ensure everyone gets one vote ? How do we verify that the person claiming to hold that ID actually voted ? How do we ensure that everyone voted ?\nI think one way to do this is with some kind of bio-metric implantable device. Activation of the device would require both mental effort and physical effort. So someone can't just push your body against a scanner and read the contents. The ID might be generated from your DNA or some other inherently unique attribute of a human being ?\n\nThe ID could even be used to generate bitcoin private addresses. Now the private key can't be stolen and exists as long as you exist. Similar to that person who implanted a chip with his priv key, you could use your body to validate transactions. This is a crazy brain dump but we are allready seeing technology which could lead in this direction.": 1, ">The things yet to come will be so disruptive we don't dare to imagine them yet. As an example...\n\nAs written, you weren't responding to 'religious crazies'.\n\nAlso, the example of a black man or white woman being president has absolutely nothing to do with them anyway.": 0, '>As an example: consider yourself 100 years ago (1915, not THAT long ago) thinking about the future when there will be a black president in USA. And yet, here we are! And now a woman has real chances to become president. \n\nReally? This is your example? \n\nNot moon landings, driverless cars, or instant global communications.

Can you code?': 1, "It doesn't have to be centrally stored.\n\nBlockchain tech can handle this. You'd be amazed at what it can do. It can pretty much replace all centralized record keeping. Imagine that there is 0 dispute over who owns a TV because the serial number is on the blockchain associated with your ID. You'd really not need much of a government after that.": 1, 'It has exactly everything to do with ;)': 1, "Yes.\n\nBut, this new 'thing', global scaling of small group dynamics or the peer-to-peer society won't happen as long as the propaganda and the 'manufacturing consent' orchestrated by the world elite isn't stopped, one way or another.
