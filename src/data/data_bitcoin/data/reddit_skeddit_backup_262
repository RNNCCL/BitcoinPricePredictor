The problem is that you\'re thinking in "transactions", which I admit is the typical way of approaching this problem, and then you\'re wondering (rightly so) how there can be plausible deniability in the absence of a large anonymityset.\n\nOne of the chief advantages that Monero has is that privacy is an integral part of the protocol, and thus everyone is a participant (willing or unwilling) in the global anonymityset. Doing it any other way (opt-in) means you have a limited set of participants. Imagine, if you will, a CoinJoin transaction (whether initiated by Dash or JoinMarket or anything else) where there are 10 participants, most of whom can be trivially identified by blockchain analysis, exchange subpoenas etc. They\'re trivially identified because *they have poor personal opsec*, which means your transactional privacy relies on the opsec of others.\n\nNow if those that can be identified can be written off as disinteresting, the remaining one or two become the suspects or culprits or whatever. Plausible deniability only works if there is a very, very large anonymityset, because people are *very bad* at opsec, and information is *very good* at freeing itself:)\n\nIn order to understand how Monero masks transactions you have to first understand how it deals with transaction outputs, and then how it deals with transaction inputs.\n\n*Note: in the explanation below I use terms like "no way" or "impossible". I do not mean it is literally impossible to do the thing I am claiming, I mean that the risk is "cryptographically negligible", which is the same risk as accidentally creating a Bitcoin address that has 50 000 Bitcoin in, or brute-force reversing a properly hashed password. This also does not mean that such a thing is not possible via an exploit, a break in the cryptography, a novel attack, or via some other mechanism that does not involve blockchain analysis.*\n\n**Transaction Outputs**\n\nIn a typical Bitcoin transaction you have outputs going to an address. Now imagine a perfect world where there is no address reuse - every output would go to a different address, right? Monero is like that, but it adds two things:\n\n1. Outputs to a single address are split up into powers of 10. In other words, if in a single transaction I am sending 123.45 XMR to one address, and 6.78 to another, I will have a total of 8 outputs: 100 XMR, 20 XMR, 3 XMR, 0.4 XMR, 0.05 XMR, 6 XMR, 0.7 XMR, 0.08 XMR. With me so far?\n\n2. Instead of each of these outputs going to an "address", they instead go to a seemingly random "destination". An oversimplified explanation of how this destination is constructed, on a per output basis, is to take the two public keys that form a Monero address, combine it with a randomly generated value, and hash the result. Because the recipient has their corresponding private keys, they can test this hash to determine whether an output is meant for them or not.\n\nThus, the transaction example I gave in (1) might have outputs that look like this, with the destination hash shortened for brevity:\n\nAmount | Destination\n---|---\n100 XMR | 119b32fba363\n20 XMR | 84f81499b4d9\n6 XMR | 27c7e83f3ad0\n3 XMR | 761fd1363f28\n0.7 XMR | 81bf9dd93919\n0.4 XMR | c4ef7e70c132\n0.08 XMR | 166238a1d768\n0.05 XMR | f3f2d97e7275\n\nPlus this transaction doesn\'t even include any change - there might be another few outputs coming back to our own wallet as change, and they appear to be the same as these other outputs! Since we cannot identify *where* the transactions are going without knowing the data used to build the destinations, we can essentially send to ourselves each time with an attacker not being able to tell as much.\n\n**Transaction Inputs**\n\nNow here\'s where the real magic comes in. When constructing a transaction we also need transaction inputs, which are just previous transaction outputs that we\'re now spending. Through the magic of ring signatures, though, what Monero does is make each input appear to come from a number of previous outputs.\n\nSo to simplify it: in our previous example we\'re spending a total of 130.23 XMR. Now let\'s say I have outputs in my wallet of 100, 30, and 0.5 XMR that I can spend (the 0.27 XMR difference would be the transaction fee in this example, although the actual tx fee is much lower, 0.01 XMR per kb).\n\nFor the input of 100 XMR we find all the previous 100 XMR outputs on the blockchain, and we select a few of them to "mix" with. I [ran a parse on the blockchain a few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/Monero/comments/3ljrap/is_mixin_possible_for_unusual_amount/cv73szg) to see how many mixable outputs there are, and there are 21 000 outputs of 100 XMR available to mix with. But let\'s say I pick the default mixin of 3, which means that input will appear to come from 1 of 4 possible outputs (my real one plus 3 others).\n\nThus, the transaction inputs for our example transaction might look something like the following:\n\nAmount | Previous Output\n---|---\n100 XMR | 056db3c3fd1f\n  | 1f1a9a6c6fca\n  | 13f5995ccd17\n  | 20599de2deae\n | \n30 XMR | f800e70b1a92\n  | d103c610096a\n  | ba52b529adc4\n  | dd06f309b2d1\n | \n0.5 XMR | e2368bb7ef52\n  | 0284d4857dcb\n  | ddaba23b119b\n  | 32fba36384f8\n\n**Anonymityset Size**\n\nAs mentioned before, the size of an anonymityset for a CoinJoin transaction, regardless of whether it uses a decentralised platform like JoinMarket or a centralised, distributed platform like Dash\'s Darksend, is limited to the participants in that CoinJoin.\n\nOn the other hand, Monero\'s potential anonymityset is based on the number of outputs available for a particular denomination, and the actual anonymityset is on a per-input basis, and user selectable (I have created many transactions with a mixin of 100, for example).\n\nMore importantly: because outputs are "unlinkable" (ie. there\'s no way to cryptographically prove that two outputs were sent to the same person) you can grow the mixable set for a denomination by sending to yourself over and over, and there\'s no way an attacker can determine that.\n\nThis also means that Monero\'s anonymityset can only grow over time, whereas with CoinJoin a lack of participants (or a situation where a portion of the participants are poisoned) will most definitely lead to a trivial deanonymisation of transactions.': 48, 'That only works if the chain is being used by a lot of people a lot of the time.': 0, 'ad hominem much?': 0}, ("Blockstream announces Liquid: Bitcoin's First Production Sidechain.

Most people here think of that in terms of simple drug sales, but the problem can go much deeper.\n\nISIS, for example, has been described as one of the best funded terrorist groups in the world:\n\nhttp://www.newsweek.com/2014/11/14/how-does-isis-fund-its-reign-terror-282607.html\n\nNow, how does ISIS get it\'s money?  It\'s mostly through Money Laundering, for which Bitcoin is a magnet.  Lets say ISIS raids a oil production facility and steals all the oil.  In order for that oil to be useful, they have to sell it.  Once they find a buyer (who is willing to look the other way for profit), they are then left with the problem of putting the money into the banking system so it can be useful all while avoiding suspicion.  You can\'t just walk into the bank with 2 duffle bags of cash and nobody ask questions.  Bitcoin is a good conduit to facilitate such transfer.  Through a network of smurfs (you can google the term), Bitcoin can be purchased with cash, and then liquidated on an exchange under the story of "i\'m a long term holder" or some other cover.  Or, more directly, the oil could be sold for Bitcoin. Now, ISIS or Black Market sellers can more easily profit from their activities, which just leads to more of the same type of illegal activities.  \n\nI don\'t believe anyone here wants to fund ISIS.  But, ISIS is an extreme story, so lets use another example.\n\nThe movie Sicario is all about drugs coming from Mexico.  [Spoiler Alert].  In it, there is a scene where a women is putting $9k cash into a bank account every day.  The $9k is supposedly to prevent automatic CTR reporting, though I\'m sure someone at the bank would see $9k in cash daily as suspicious.  The money placement was done by multiple individuals, usually unsuspecting people like middle class white women, in order to conceal the money derived from drug activity.  The middle class smurfs in this story were no doubt receiving some sort of financial kickback.\n\nWhy do we care?  Well, in this particular story, the Mexican drug lord was killing a fuck ton of people over the whole war on drugs.  The killings all came about because money laundering allowed drug sales to be profitable.  \n\nA good solution here would be to consider ending the war on drugs, but that\'s another topic.  The fact that there is a war between governments and drug lords which leads to a lot of killing is a problem.  \n\nSome more considerations.  Have you ever stopped to consider the amount of violence in east African countries?  Many of these countries don\'t have strict anti-money laundering practices (they don\'t care, they\'re just glad to see the money coming in).  As a result, crime becomes highly profitable with little risk, which just goes to perpetuate a culture of crime and violence.  \n\nSo, why do these companies want to look so hard at your cash flow?  Because A) The penalties for having an ineffective AML policy are stout and B) These groups attend seminars on which the above is explained in much higher detail.  How bad would it suck for Coinbase for the FBI to pay them a visit one day just to let them know their failure to regulate helped fund an ISIS attack on the US?  \n\nI\'m sure most people here don\'t think that can happen or doesn\'t happen, but I\'m convinced that it does.  So, just take that into consideration next time you have to prove your identity or tell these companies what you\'re spending BTC on.\n\n\n\n': 1, "Altcoins don't fix bitcoin's problems.

Keep the flow free and wide.\nThe Stenka\'s men were able to trust him to navigate the river and to support the poor.

Not a single or a group of people, which they may call themselves Oh, NO:\nA board of Directors\nWe need to preserve this structure. No board of directors. A few, governing many to navigate in their own purpose, their own ports to deposit goods, ... must not be allowed.\nI see this happened to our great nation of USA. 535 legistrature governing 320 million of us making us poor with their dealing with passing the measures put forth by another group of the few for (subprime, derivatives, mortgage backed trust ...) and finally, the mandatory Obama care, making e.g., drugs more expensive for the poor.\nSame for the State, County, and down to the town/cities.

Same happening at our next door neighboring towns. A few 5 counsels voting themselves against 35K town citizens on allowing to build Monster houses as already done in our town. It\'s too late for me to understand the \'flow\'. The consel making this decision should of been stopped at the money flow. As they say, follow the flow of $$. From the State, County, then to the town. It should of stopped at higher level. That Las Tunas drive portion belongs to my town but it is a thoroughfare used by the thousands of commuters coming from the east side, like Pomona, San Dimas, ... to downtown LA. I\'ve mentioned this in the counsel meeting but was ignored. Call to the LA supervisor\'s office of Antonovitch was met by \'Oh, it doesn\'t belong to the county, it belongs to your town\'. Yet, the county office metered out the $10 millions to do the diagonal parking.\nI see the same for our corporate (capitalistic) structure. A few, say 5 - 10 board of directors governing the fate of all those who actually working day n\' night, week after week with little pay and little time off decide to send work out to Shanghi, laying off thousands of US workers while they get millions in their salaries, compensations, bonuses, ... and more raises voting themselves.\nSame for our Japanese American community, a microcosm level - Selling off Keiro Retirement Home complex by the few, the home\'s board of directors and the CEO. They had no right to determine the fate of the all those senior residents, some in dire conditions and to their families and the seniors in waiting to get in by outright selling the facility without allowing the most important people to vote for no. The proceed of $41 million was said to be used for educating about aging (huh?). The $$ should be used to create new Retirement home without the board of selfish directors or CEOs. Let the citizens make the laws and govern themselves without the greedy few. Campigns, voting? Elections? do these matter as the outcome of our citizens well being, both emotionally (promises), health and financial security? So goes for the global trade deals that US corporations thru our government and now every other nations had gotten involved with the expense of our liveryhood. Tell that to homeless here in LA.

But lots  of people use the term more generally when attempting to explain why a currency has value.  And I have to give him some credit here, saying that fiat is backed by "men with guns" is a lot more accurate than the breezy claim you often hear which is that the dollar is backed by the "full faith and credit of the U.S. government."  As I\'ve written before:\n\n*What* gives fiat *value* is the wrong question. Value is subjective. *People* assign (differing and subjective) values to fiat based on their perceptions and preferences. A better question is what gives fiat its *price* -- in terms of the quantity of goods / services that a person must "spend" in order to "buy" a given quantity of fiat. Price is determined by the intersection of supply and demand. In order to have a "supply" in an economic sense, a good needs to be scarce. Where does fiat\'s (relative) scarcity come from? Well, that does in fact come from men with guns granting a violence-backed monopoly on fiat\'s issuance to a privileged elite. What about the demand side? Well, government violence plays a role there as well. Taxes collected via threat of violence are payable exclusively in fiat. Legal tender laws (enforced via violence) are another way that fiat is given a privileged position in the market for money. And would-be money competitors are also disadvantaged by things like taxation on capital gains when trading, e.g. appreciated precious metals (even if that "appreciation" is only an artifact of fiat\'s depreciation). As I say, Bitcoin uses a blockchain protected by proof of work. Fiat uses debt chains protected by proof of violence.\n\n>"Bitcoin is not."\n\nNo. And some of us see that as a good thing.  Bitcoin is scarce by design -- its fixed, finite supply makes it much more reliably scarce than the constantly inflating dollar. Unlike with fiat, you simply don\'t need violence to protect the scarcity of Bitcoin\'s money supply. And as for the demand side? Bitcoin, not unlike gold, has sufficiently desirable monetary properties to generate *voluntary* demand for it.  It\'s not such a terrible form of money that people have to be coerced into using it.

All of these are made up of hardware, software, a network of users, etc.\n\nBitcoins (the tokens) represent fractional control of new transactions on the blockchain.  Since the only way to use the Network is by having some of the tokens, they derive their value from the Network's.  The more people who want and need to use the network, the more demand for the tokens.  Since there are a finite number of tokens, their value will go up with demand.\n\nThings don't need backing if they are useful in some way.  Take a 2x4 piece of lumber.  It has value in itself, without any other backing.  But a 2x4 doesn't have properties that make it a good form of money.  Bitcoins (the tokens) are a tradable commodity first, like 2x4s, but they also have properties that make them good as money: easily determined value, easy to transport, durability, hard to counterfeit, divisible.\n\nFor a commodity to rise to be a currency it must also be commonly used as a substitute for barter in trade (medium of exchange), hold value over time, and as a unit of account.  That doesn't happen overnight.  Bitcoin is used as a currency by a small community at present.  If it demonstrates good properties over time, it can be adopted by more people, and become a full currency.

Look, money, like other terms in economics, has a very specific definition and use requirements it must meet in order to be called a money.  We all know that the dollar or euro or yen only gained and retain their monetary status due to the coercion used by governments and their central banks.  I get it.  I wish it ~~was~~ wasn't money, just like you probably wish it ~~was~~ wasn't money.  And I wish that bitcoin and/or gold were serving as money and displacing fiat.  And I believe that that is happening and will continue to happen (see: Thier's law).  But wishing does not make it so, and the space-time continuum is still in effect.  There still exists now, and later.  There still exists bitcoin, in it's proto-money state, and the dollar in it's actualized money state.  Things change.  Processes take time.\n\nI'm not a fan of government fiat.  I'm all about making sure that bitcoin does become money and drives out government created money.  But that is irrelevant as to which of these two fits the definition and use-case of money.  \n\nPossessing properties (e.g. high degree of: scarcity, divisibility, homogeneity, fungibility, durability, etc) of good money potential, does not make something a money yet.  There are a good many commodities which fit this bill, and did in the past become money in certain economic sphere (e.g. cigarettes become money in prison, even though, outside of prison or before those particular conditions arose, was not money; cigarettes simply possessed the best monetary qualities of all available commodities to the prisoners, and so **became** money. . . . were not always money).\n\nTherefore, there is no technical accuracy, and no point in calling anything with good monetary qualities (even bitcoin) a money; when it has not yet developed into the fully actualized, unit of account, network good, which economists call money.\n\nWhy is this so hard to understand?

It\'s also self-evident, so why would one even discuss it?\n\nSo, perhaps we already agree? 1. Bitcoin has all the properties it needs to be good money (well, far better than sex and horses, anyway), and 2. Bitcoin isn\'t widely (for most definitions of "wide") *used* today.\n\nIs that a fair conclusion?': 2, 'Where is it being used as unit of account?  Where do you see people saying: "this coffee says it costs $4....how much is that in bitcoin?': 0, "There's a reason why it is important to understand and make the case that bitcoin is not yet money; and that is because money developing on a market is subject to a classic public goods problem (as I explained higher in the thread).  \n\nGold existed, with all its glorious good potential money properties, long before it was money.  It likely took a long, long time for gold to develop into money on the market, because (before it was ever coined by kings and declared money) it developed into money via market mechanisms, which tend to be slower to overcome public goods problem.\n\nLike gold, bitcoin is developing into a money on the market.  It is not going to be declared money by fiat and forced into circulation and acceptance.  Gold (and other physical commodities) have significant non-monetary use-value (e.g. jewelry) which essentially bootstrapped them into fairly wide circulation and ubiquitous, liquid ownership just for that reason.  Because of this, it was well poised to fill the role as a medium of indirect exchange (alleviating the double coincidence of wants in barter).  Bitcoin does not enjoy as readily apparent non-monetary use-value.  It needs to be socially bootstrapped into position as money.  It literally does require us (at least in order to accelerate the process) to be entrepreneurial and perceive of the future, much higher, value of bitcoin as a fully actualized unit of account money, and demand to hold as such.  The speculation and the price spikes are very healthy and expected price discovery behavior.  Markets use lotteries and lottery like conditions (the high risk, high reward gamble of investing in bitcoin) in order to overcome the public goods problems.  FOMO etc., prompts people to (whether they realize it or not) fund the creation of a sufficiently wide and liquid monetary base, and ignore fears of free riders (thrill or greed overcome this).\n\nSo many people are so disillusioned with bitcoin right now because they never understood how very much more valuable it could be (and the much more profound effects it will have upon our world), if it is held and demanded in it's own right, as a money. . . rather than just as a proxy currency; a payment network with which to compete with paypal and bank transfers.\n\nMoney is considered a network good by macroeconomists: which means that a large enough quantitative change in bitcoin's widespread use (as money) does in fact become something of a qualitative change, and an equilibrium of sorts is reached, with a certain saturation.\n\nI agree that, with such good monetary properties; bitcoin is highly likely to achieve monetary status.  But no, I don't understand the strange hangup about acknowledging present tense and future tense.  Babies are not yet adults. . . even though they will be.  A caterpillar is not a butterfly even though it will be and it is in its makeup, its inherent properties to become so.  Bitcoin is not yet money, but I think it will be.": 3, "It's safe to say you really don't know what you're talking about.": -5, 'Is an amex card money?': 2, '> I cannot understand and explain to myself that something someone created out of nothing should represent any value to anyone.\n\nWell, then in that case, it\'s surprising that you should be a fan of bitcoin.  It is similar to fiat, paper money in that one sense.  \n\nBut no, here\'s the real explanation:  Value is subjective to the individual.  Value is not money.  Value is not wealth.  Value is often ethereal and abstract and not just based on use-value or tangible or observable benefits.  But most importantly, human beings have highly developed neo-cortexes and we can imagine and perceive of future value and future utility, and we can understand abstractions.  That is why we have money in the first place.  Human beings can understand that; even though nobody can eat this shiny rock or do anything with it right now that people tend to do with things they value, I can conceive of how everyone wanting this shiny rock and having liquid reserves of this shiny rock, would be extremely useful and valuable to us all (in order to alleviate the problem of the double-coincidence of wants and so we all have a shared unit of accounting in trade), and even valuable to those who do not now value or demand this shiny rock in its own right.  And yet, money (especially gold and silver money) **did** arise on markets.  We, as humans, had and have the ability to conceive of this future arrangement, and advocate to make it so. . . to sell people on the future value. . . to speculate.  Sometimes, especially when there\'s an already existing apparatus of central control and coercion, we take advantage of that apparatus in order to short-cut the production of this public good.  We use the false belief in the efficacy of the coercion of that central controller in order to force the market, to force people to obtain and use and circulate (and yes, to value) the unit of currency or the commodity which we believe makes the best money.  I assume that I don\'t need to go into why this method (though usually quicker in overcoming the public goods problem) is inferior and less desirable to allowing the market to take time and painstakingly suss out which commodity(ies) will best suit its needs; and to also let the market determine the relative and absolute money supply; and to also let the market perpetually present competition to the incumbent money.\n\nAnd for these same reasons, fiat money; even when the issuing authority dissolves; can still have value and utility **as a money**, **as a network good**, even though nobody even wants or needs the paper that it is printed on to burn for heat.  See: the case of the [Somali Shilling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_shilling#Unregulation) for an [example](http://www.economist.com/node/21551492) of this.\n\nThis is why I have been arguing this entire time, that there are some qualitative differences (rather than just quantitative) between:  bitcoin being able to be used at a select few places to purchase dinner or coffee (as proxy for fiat), but even being used by a few small isolated groups of people as unit of account (such as altcoin traders who do tend to use bitcoin as the actual unit of account in which they calculate the value of their trades. . . though I will readily concede that in this small sphere, bitcoin is indeed money); between that and bitcoin actually becoming a network-good-unit-of-account.  Where it actually displaces other monies for the most part (because that is what money necessarily tends to do, otherwise it wouldn\'t be good money).  Where it\'s moneyness is not just limited to a small, obscure sphere of trade, but where it\'s moneyness extends to a sphere where it begins to disrupt really important things: like the apparatus which creates the fiat money which bitcoin is striving to displace. . .just to name one.  where, when you go to buy a coffee, or groceries, or pay your bills; you find it easier to calculate how much that coffee is worth to you in terms of satoshis than you do in terms of dollars (i.e., in your head, you\'re not just going: "okay, 0.0156 BTC, let\'s see. . . that\'s about 4 dollars...yeah, okay, I have a sense for what amount of time and effort 4 dollars represents to me.")  \n\nWhen we\'re doing that in reverse in our heads; when we know what our effort and time are valued in in terms of bitcoin. .. when that is happening in a wide enough sphere of economic catallaxy, which encompasses the apparati, the institutions which cause the very troubles which bitcoin was created to alleviate, when this sphere extends to disrupting the taxation apparatus which produces an artificial demand sink which largely upholds the moneyness of that fiat and keeps competition artificially at bay. . . then, bitcoin is money.  Then bitcoin will actually be having the positive impact on the world, which I (and many others) were always excited about.\n\nBitcoin, as it is now, is next to nothing.  Not just because of scale.  It is not qualitatively performing functions which it can in the future perform.  Most people (even here in /r/bitcoin) conceive of bitcoin so shallowly.  They thing that there\'s nothing left for it but to scale.  They think that (because right now at least) it is slightly cheaper than paypal or western union or bank transfers, that that is what makes bitcoin interesting or really valuable.  This mindset has got to die.  Buttcoiners exists because the amount of enthusiasm which exists over bitcoin legitimately seems misplaced. . . because they do not understand bitcoin as I have described.  They understand it as most others do. . . yet they see the enthusiasm from folks who understand it as I do, and who make sometimes grandiose speculations as to what it can accomplish. . . and that understandably seems ridiculous; because bitcoin in its current state can\'t possibly fulfill those speculations.  There is a quantitative change, which needs to take place, which is so many orders of magnitude larger, that it is in effect a qualitative change.\n\nThe question is whether than change can and will take place. . .and I believe it requires a certain degree of *willing* it to happen, of speculation, of understanding of money and the future, higher, value and utility of a completely new money-system (rather than just a decentralized paypal), and the understanding of the necessity of holding and demanding to hold the coin. . .in order to bring about a transition of bitcoin into moneyness within our lifetimes.
