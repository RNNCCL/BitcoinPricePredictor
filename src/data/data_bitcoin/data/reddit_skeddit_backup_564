Like\n\n    x + y + z = 19\n    2x + 3y - z = 17\n    3x - 4y + 2z = 6\n\nWell, when you reuse your address, you are basically churning out additional equations to fit with a much more complex version of this.  Now, if your RNG (Random Number Generator) is good, then you most likely won't encounter a problem, as it will make this system ridiculously difficult to solve.

Now, when you *receive* bitcoin, your private key is not involved, so you can receive as much as you want if you have no concerns about privacy.

The additional risks break down like this:  \n\n1) Sending from an address the first time makes the public key visible in the block chain. The public key is a double-hash closer to the private key than the address. But even if an attacker has your public key, you\'re still very safe.  \n\n2) Repeated sends publish more transactions signed by this particular private key. If someone manages to collect one or more such signed transactions, they can theoretically use the information as data to try to reverse from the public key back to candidate private keys. In theory, to make such attempts, the more data the attacker has the better, so he/she would attempt to gather as many signed transactions as possible. As a first step, lots of data might help reveal flaws or patterns in the RNG that was used to create the transactions. Still, AFAIK, there\'s currently no known exploit where *any amount* of this data could realistically reverse from a public key back to candidate private keys. But advances in cryptography are occurring all the time, so things could change.  \n\n3) Lots of transactions involving this address mean more records in the block chain. This increases the odds that your address could attract the attention of an attacker, but it doesn\'t make executing an attack any easier.  \n\n4) Every wallet that receives funds from this address or that sends funds to this address will likely log the transaction. Weak security at any of those endpoints could increase the exposure of your address.  \n\n5) (This one doesn\'t apply to you if you are signing with your Trezor.) If you\'re not using off-line signing, the private key for this address is being used from a hot wallet. The longer you sign using this private key in this manner, the more it is exposed in a "hot" situation, and that means the probability increases that it will be compromised increases with time.  \n\nThat\'s all I can think of.': 5, "Link?

Thanks for discussing this with me.': 1, "So here's the thing -> while you have two viable chains they could indeed be spent on each chain (but you have to talk to each chain separately)...\n\nKeeping the both chains viable would be hard though...  you would either have to physically isolate the networks using either chain (think islands and species divergence over time - no communication/interaction) or make changes to the protocol on one chain so that it doesn't interact with the other -> either way you have effectively two coins (blockchains) and the 'value' of the coins will likely change (weaker network/increased risk of confusion/...)\n\nIn reality little microforks can (and do) happen (and you could indeed have spends on each microfork to a different target) -> but only one chain wins over time (and the coins get spent once -> so waiting for sufficient confirmations is wise if you are a vendor).": 2, "Hmm. Although I think I follow what you're saying, I'm not sure it's entirely true. In particular, I don't think you need to talk to each chain separately, but you *do* need to assume that both chains might be hearing all of the transactions. See if this makes sense to you: A hard fork means that the code for NewBitcoin is not backward compatible with the code for OriginalBitcoin. But that doesn't really specify what that means with respect to transmitting and accepting individual transactions. It makes sense to assume that some or all OriginalBitcoin transactions may be accepted by NewBitcoin nodes. In the opposite direction, OriginalBitcoin nodes may accept some NewBitcoin transactions, or they might not accept any. They definitely can't accept *all* NewBitcoin transactions, because if they did that would mean it would've been a soft fork at most, and not a hard fork.  \n\nRegardless, if a user stays within either the NewBitcoin *or* OriginalBitcoin networks after the fork, they should be fine and encounter no irregularities. They only might encounter problems if they try to spend coins that were already spent on one fork on the other fork. The spend on the second fork may or may not work depending on how much transaction cross-talk got into that fork from previous transactions that were intended only for the other fork.  \n\nI think that's right. If I got you to read this far, what do you think?": 2, "That is pretty much the big issue/risk with hardforks.  We can talk about decentralization but it seems to me that whichever fork the main payment processors accept (like BitPay and Coinbase) is the one I'd want to be on so I'd be able to spend my coin.  As a miner I'd want to be working on the chain that has the most value and is accepted by the bitcoin exchanges I deal with (Bitfinex/OKCoin/whatever).": 2, "If there is a different transaction version number that is included in the signature then yes, the transactions would not be valid on both network.\n\n> A miner cannot mine both coins at the same time\n\nI wasn't suggesting a miner submit the same blocks to both networks.": 1, "I'd want to be on the fork that holds it's value better (at least for cold storage). If bitpay/coinbase are on the other fork I'd keep a small hot wallet on that fork. The 2 coins will be easily exchangeable.\n\nThe only problem is that until the chains diverge enough your transactions will be valid on both chains.": 1, 'After giving this question some thought, my answer is i dont know for sure. But ill speculate that this couldnt be possible. Why? Lets begin by honering the fact that they have the same origin, only differing by the hard fork split. And you have one wallet with coins. Keep in mind the each blockchain is  constantly being updated by confirming ALL transactions. If you spend some coins on the new block chain first, that transaction will eventually reach the other blockchain, the original. So both blockchains are aware of that transaction. So if you tried to spend those same coins on the original, it will be denied because it already has confirmed that the coins have been spent.\n\n\nAnother situation is that if you tried to double spend simultaneously, it would be a race to confirmation, and one would eventually be confirmed, and the other denied.\n\n\nThis is the reason double spends cant ultimately be successful. Every coin has a history, even if its no history, therefore, mathematically, a coin cant have two different histories for an extended period of time.The only way i forsee anything like this happening is if some protocol drastically change and a whole new coin was created and the two chains wouldnt be able to communicate with eachother. ': 2, "Glanced over that article, but it doesn't seem to directly address this issue: if two viable Bitcoin block chain forks exist, can bitcoins be spent twice \xe2\x80\x94 once per block chain?": 3, "Thanks for considering my hypothesis. I think the whole thing hinges on what changes occur in the hard fork, and how those changes affect the acceptance or rejection of transactions on the two block chains. NewBitcoin transactions will be accepted by NewBitcoin nodes and get mined by NewBitcoin miners into the new block chain. The same is true of OriginalBitcoin transactions and the original block chain. The uncertainty comes in when we ask what NewBitcoin nodes will do when they receive a OriginalBitcoin transaction and vice versa. As far as I can tell, if you stay with a single fork, everything will work fine. It's only if you try to spend some coins that were already spent on one fork on the other fork that uncertainty comes in. If all the nodes on the other fork rejected the transactions that spent the coins on the first fork, when you load the private keys up into a client running code for the other fork, then spend them, I believe the transaction should work fine. If, on the other hand, the nodes of the other fork did accept the previous transactions that were intended for the first fork, those coins will have already been spent when you try to spend them for the second time. But I think whether the nodes of the other fork reject the transaction(s) from the first fork or not depends on exactly what the changes are in the hard fork and how they are implemented in the code.": 1, 'http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/who-controls-bitcoin/': 3, 'The definition of the issue with hardforks, and why we have PoW to begin with.': 3, "both would agree about the coins prefork as valid and then differ about things after the fork depending on what happened (of course all the newly mined coins would be chain specific).  If a valid transaction was broadcast to both chains in this case then both chains could mempool it and/or put it in a block.\n\nIt wouldn't be viable very long if both chains hear all the transaction broadcasts...  for practical reasons one chain would need to be chosen before long (it would be very hard to keep the two chains in this case viable -> very very hard if they hear each other).\n\nHeh...

As long as the protocol change that caused the fork is such that transaction requests and block broadcasts can be distinguished, and the transaction signatures use the same private keys, each user can just clone his wallet, install both clients, and move his coins in each chain independently.\n\nThis isn't enough. You'd need to spend your coins to different addresses on the 2 networks before using them. Otherwise your transaction will be valid on both networks. A miner that mines both chains could take your transaction from 1 network and mine it on the other in order to claim additional transaction fees.": 1, 'Yes.

Unless one of the coins is obviously worthless, they will make more money by supporting both coins than by suporting only one.\n\nYou can even fork the bitcoin chain yourself and start mining the new branch on a laptop.  Of course, no one will want to exchange dollars for bitcoins in your chain, so other users will probably not care for the coins that they have there.  Unless you are a very good marketer...': 1, 'I am assuming that the transactions and blocks can be distinguished by a version stamp or cosmetic format change (or use different nodes and ports) so that both old clients and new clients will ignore messages belonging to the other coin (or will not even see them).

There's no point in doing it now because, as you say, capital costs are so high that they force miners to think long-term, but Satoshi obviously gave us this knob to turn in case miners started thinking short term (a real risk when Bitcoin started, CPU mining was the norm, and anyone could fire up thousands of per-hour nodes on Amazon EC2).\n": 2, "There is a lot of altruism in society, but there is also a lot of free-riding. If you sit down and compare systems reliant on altruism to systems reliant on incentivising participants that the former systems are constantly shaky and unstable.

You are most often fighting uphill with human nature.\n\nI'm not saying that altruism won't or can't play a role in bolstering and propelling Bitcoin's success. It can and clearly has. I'm saying that pinning one's hopes primarily on altruism is dangerous. Do you really think Bitcoin would have done so well if Satoshi had decided to award miners with likes and karma points instead of a scarce token? I doubt it. In fact the distribution of rewards to nodes is precisely an example of how well a system works when its participants are correctly incentivised, and altruism is *not* relied upon.\n\nWe need a stable, reliable economic foundation for Bitcoin's security, and altruism is not that foundation.

Would they be as well-trained and equipped if they were pure volunteers? 3) There is a basic guilt/positive emotion complex that makes people feel good for behaving altruistically.

I note that point several times! I think if you paid attention you would have realised that the quoted transaction fee is a mutually-agreed upon value that is *higher* than the equilibrium (cost-covering) tx fee (because as mentioned it's part of a hypothetical scenario.)  I show how even given such a starting point, the result is unstable, and fees will decrease. \n\n> If the miner's costs are too high to survive on the prevailing level of fees, it will go out of business, reducing difficulty and increasing profitability for those that remain.\n\nExactly. What I demonstrated is that in a system of purely voluntary network funding through fees, fees will trend to just covering the cost of including transactions, and there will be no premium for hashing, and thus no security.\n\nAs I mentioned, this is the first in a series of intended posts, so this article just focuses on a scenario of purely voluntary fees. It's important to refute this idea because it is such a common refrain in the community. The subsequent articles will round out the analysis by looking at other different possible methods for funding security.

Chain rewrites for other reasons scare people into thinking Bitcoin isn't secure, likely causing the value (in absolute terms) of the block reward to decrease.)\n\nThat aside, I think mildly altruistic mining will play a big part in Bitcoin's future.  As soon as its possible to mine without much hassle (e.g. no dealing with preorders and new equipment every few months), I plan to upgrade my home full node into a solo miner with about $365/year worth of mining equipment---I think of it has playing the Bitcoin Lottery rather than the state-sanctioned $1/ticket lottery that I sometimes play.": 3, ">As I mentioned, this is the first in a series of intended posts, so this article just focuses on a scenario of purely voluntary fees.

A transaction sitting in the memory pool, regardless of the size of its attached fee, costs essentially nothing to add to the next block.\n\nRefusing to confirm a transaction with a lowball fee means leaving money on the table. So even unprofitable blocks are mined. Most miners will have no choice but to operate this way.
