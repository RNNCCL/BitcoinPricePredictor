What was happening was that there was a router somewhere between us and Bleutrade that does not support IPv6 or which is misconfigured.  The DNS entries resolve correctly, but we can't connect to them.  The result is that a request is sent to the IPv6 address, it takes 10 seconds to time out, and then another DNS lookup is performed to get an IPv4 address, which is reachable and immediately connects.\n\nThe end result of this was failsafes being triggered because we could not get up-to-date pricing from the exchange.  More importantly, there was an increase in orphaned blocks, especially in daemons with fast block times, because of this timeout problem.\n\nWe will revisit IPv6 in one or two years, after the technology is more widely deployed.  It only takes one misconfigured router somewhere to make it impossible, or extremely slow, to connect to an IPv6 address.

This completely misses the point of Bitcoin and would simply serve to create a weaker imitation. I say this because Bitcoin is an open source technology and anyone can contribute and build upon the Bitcoin network. It is a free network that is open for innovation to take place. A closed network would simply serve those in control.\n\nThere are currently hundreds to thousands of people working on new Bitcoin services and code, that is only possible due to its open nature. A network or protocol controlled by a central authority would be less innovative due to it being a walled garden. During the early days of the internet, AOL tried to keep users on its own network and made it very hard to access external sites. This meant that users had a very limited reach to other websites and could only sample a small selection of what the internet had to offer.\n\nThis also happened with mobile phones in the early 2000\xe2\x80\x99s where internet access was through the WAP protocol and you were forced to use the services of your mobile carrier. Services like these were superseded by the full blown internet as it had vastly more information and utility. As the internet was open to all, more companies and individuals were able to develop and create new content and services. This in turn made the open internet more valuable in comparison to services like AOL that had less content.\n\nSome of these services also happened to cost more as customers had no choice or competition to chose from. The MMS protocol is a fine example of this. It was reasonably expensive to send a simple photo from your mobile phone to another when picture messaging was relatively new. Today you can send a picture message for nothing in a variety of different ways. History has always shown that you can not trust a central authority with control of a system or its content. It always leads corruption or control over the masses in one form or another.\n\nBitcoin will be the long term winner as it is completely self sufficient much like the internet today and vastly more empowering over the competition or legacy systems that it will replace. Any alternative that is controlled by a central authority feels like a Bitcoin 0.5 clone that is heavily gimped and destined to fail like other antiquated and closed systems of the past.

In the current implementation of FitCoin, before it \'eventually moves to its own alt-coin\', it gives the user 20 cents/hour worth of bitcoin (a minuscule amount). In the future idea of a company using the technology, the user would get paid money to use a company\'s fitness products. This money represents a discount and also incentivizes use of the company\'s product. Presumably, the customer would have a good experience and would be encouraged to again buy the same company\'s products in the future (for the product, and to continue earning future discounts).\n\nFor the company to use an alt-coin custom cryptocurrency instead of bitcoin, it would appear to make little to no difference in terms of ROI. If a product cost originally $50... and the user earned $10 worth of bitcoins or $10 worth of the company\'s custom alt-coin, the user is going to spend $40 of his/her own money and $10 of the company\'s money (the \'discount\' earned through use/loyalty), regardless. The company gets $40 of outside money and gives a discount of $10, either way. Using the premier cryptocurrency network/unit (by many orders of magnitude), as opposed to some crap-coin, is thus simply the sensible route to take.\n\nBy the way, as another user mentioned, the marketing aspect can still be incorporated by creating AdidasCoin \'on top\' of bitcoin somehow, thus retaining AdidasCoin on the surface while still being \'powered by Bitcoin\' network.': 6, 'Proof of Steak is better': 3, '> and there is consequently no reason to expect the appcoin ever to become valuable.\n\nThis is utterly retarded, if there is a real world purpose where users need to buy the coin for, than it has value.

Because the US military conquered those places and forced them to.

The US military ensures that commodities we want like oil are sold on the global capitalist market; when foreign countries try not to, we invade.  If we didn't, there might be a Soviet Ruble that was today stronger than the USD.  ": 1, '"A powerful military is the result of strong money, not the other way around."

Here\'s why.  First, it would as you already said bridge the gap b/t fiat and Bitcoin.  It would make incredibly easy to switch b/t the two.

We all know how fiat eventually ends with unlimited printing power.  Moreover, the Fedcoin would make Bitcoin more successful.  Just think if a tiny fraction of the wealth from the USD was stored in Bitcoin.  We are talking easy $40,000+ a coin here.  I would love to see Fedcoin.  For a while it may be much less volatile than Bitcoin but over time it would make Bitcoin more stable.  Eventually, 20 years or more Bitcoin could possibly be more stable than Fedcoins.  For the long term store of value problem Bitcoin just needs to consistently go up over time.  From what I have ready there are BitUSD being developed so by the time Fedcoin finally comes along it may be late.  Eventually, the USD has to go digital b/c it makes logical sense.  However, I in no know seeing killing Bitcoin b/c again its centralized and controlled by the Feds.  The biggest downfall I see to Fedcoin would that developers cannot build on top of it.  Bitcoin will eventually smooth out in price volatility once all these super cool Apps get layered on top.  I mean who ever could have imagined Facebook, Uber, Amazon and Bitcoin in 93\'.  Going back to your specific question "what are the benefits to Fedcoin" I will list them clearly.  1.  Increases Bitcoin adaption by easy of transfer 2.  Its obvious that if you are using these Fedcoins (digital dollars) Bitcoin would seem that much more familiar to use and that alone would give Bitcoin a boost of new users  3.  Hedging is a big one and it probably could fit under easy of transfer.  However, its important b/c let\'s say another type of crisis breaks out.  We\'ll we already now what the Feds we do - print more Fedcoins!  Everybody runs over to Bitcoin just like Gold in 09\' but this time its Gold 2.0 where everyone can transact anywhere in the world.  Now the bigger question is will the Feds policy still be effective when there\'s an alt currency that goes up in value longterm while at the same time being a payment protocol.  My best guess is eventually over time the masses will learn to trust Bitcoin the Currency much more than Fedcoins.  So in the end Fedcoin helps Bitcoin gain acceptance.  Go Fedcoin\xe2\x80\xa6LOL!

Tellers will also be able to sell their digital currency to other tellers or send it to an external btc address to sell on an exchange.

This also eliminates any teller arbitrage opportunities to game the system.\n\nWhen a consumer sends funds p2p the 3 day hedge doesn't reset. The outstanding hedge of the money being transferred is simply transferred to the receiver along with the underlying digital currency.

King, JD, CPA, MAcc, General Counsel of the Tennessee Bitcoin Alliance, has written a white paper titled "Thoughts on Valuing Bitcoin as a Network"', 7): {"Generally agree, although Mises focused on an original industrial use in order to end the regression, which does not match the usefulness of writing to Bitcoin's *monetary network*.  Bitcoin shows Mises was wrong.": 2, "The paper's conclusion:\n\nBitcoin is fundamentally a network, and a uniquely useful one at that.  Individual bitcoins (or fractions thereof) represent the exclusive means of gaining write-access to the Bitcoin network.  Importantly, bitcoins provide such access not as a privilege or right granted by law but rather as a mathematical requirement of the system itself.  Without bitcoins, transacting via the bitcoin system is physically impossible.    \n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a tautology to say that useful networks have use value.  And because bitcoins are the exclusive means of accessing the unique Bitcoin network and are limited in supply, they too have use value.  This demonstrates that bitcoins meet the requirements of Mises\xe2\x80\x99s Regression Theorum.    \n\nThe two generally-accepted ways of determining the inherent usefulness of a network is Metcalfe\xe2\x80\x99s law and the n log(n) formula (collectively herein called the \xe2\x80\x9cpower law valuation metrics\xe2\x80\x9d).  Both indicate that the value of a network is a function of its number of nodes or users, though they disagree as to how much value each additional node adds.  Being more conservative and seemingly more realistic, the n log(n) formulation is probably to be preferred. \n\nBoth of the power law valuation metrics describe only how much a network\xe2\x80\x99s value varies as a function of changes in the number of its nodes.  Neither reveals what the network\xe2\x80\x99s value actually is.  To determine actual value, one must make additional assumptions. \n\nBy calculating and/or assuming the number of Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s users (nodes) each year along with a use value for the network at any given point in time (\xe2\x80\x9cx\xe2\x80\x9d), we can use the power law valuation metrics to estimate an implied value per bitcoin at any other given time past or present.  Results of these calculations, as indicated in this essay, vary wildly based upon one\xe2\x80\x99s assumption of \xe2\x80\x9cx\xe2\x80\x9d and which valuation metric preferred. \n\nHowever, despite wild fluctuations in bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s market price (likely due primarily to speculation and/or illiquidity), the number of unique daily users (nodes) of the Bitcoin network has doubled every eight months for at least the last three years, and the pace of adoption seemingly shows no signs of diminishing.  Consequently, both of the power law valuation metrics indicate that the intrinsic use value of the network has grown at an almost steady exponential rate for many years.  This suggests that bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s famous volatility in market price does not adversely impact network usefulness or slow the pace of user adoption. \n\n[See the paper for some interesting projections of the future value of individual bitcoins under various sets of assumptions.]": 3, "Don't smileys count for anything, anymore?": 1, "You're mad!

Bitcoin is the first attempt to improve upon gold's economic utility.\n\nI think there is evidence to suggest that unique aspects of gold that are essential for economic activity have all been improved upon, and therefore gold may become obsolete.\n\nIf Silicon valley can disrupt the following industries...\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOubCHLXT6A&t=8m33s\n\n...then there is no reason why gold should have some special exemption.\n\nThe only aspect that was not recreated was gold's physical characteristics.
