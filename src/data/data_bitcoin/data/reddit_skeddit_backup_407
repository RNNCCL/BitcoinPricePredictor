But it depends on the size of your keys and your access to a sufficiently sophisticated quantum computer.  The largest key scheme publicly broken to date has been 112-bit (prime field) but since you\'re posting here in /r/bitcoin I\'ll assume you are referring to 256-bit key.\n\nA private EC key is simply a random number in the range of 1 to n - 1, where \'n\' is the order of the curve.  In Bitcoin\'s case, the curve used is secp256k1 so the \'n\' value (in decimal) is: 115792089237316195423570985008687907852837564279074904382605163141518161494337.\n\nHowever, even though the private key is simply a random number, the public key is not - it\'s the elliptic curve point that corresponds to the private key based on the formula P=nQ.  To obtain the new point, you multiply the base point \'Q\' with the private key using elliptic curve scalar multiplication which includes several expensive mathematical steps.  This creates a mathematical "trap door" where it\'s easy to go one way through (P=nQ) but practically impossible to go the other way and obtain the original n.\n\nBut, all is not lost!  If you had access to the original machine that created the keys you\'re trying to break, you could ask the machine to generate more keys for you and, by watching the power used by the CPU and also timing the software itself, you could apply computationally-inexpensive statistical methods and possibly recover the original private key.  On the other hand, if the developer who wrote the EC key generation software running on this machine was aware of power & side-channel attacks and used algorithm(s) resistant to these attacks, it could make it a lot more difficult.  Other more sophisticated methods to find the key exist but the limitations of current computer technology mean that your victim\'s 256-bit private key is safe for now. ;)\n\nIt\'s a really good question, by the way!

You can build it yourself and test, or you can download binaries at https://bitcoin.org/bin/bitcoin-core-0.11.0/test/, and test those.\n\n**Reminder:** Always check the signatures on any binaries that you run! On bitcoin.org/bin, you'll find a signature file called SHA256SUMS.asc signed by /u/laanwj, and you can find signatures from multiple people building the binaries independently at https://github.com/bitcoin/gitian.sigs.\n\nIf you do want to compile your own binaries, on Linux it's a pretty standard `./autogen.sh&&./configure&&make` (with options that can be passed to configure and make as usual). You can install dependencies as system packages, with some tips in [build-unix.md](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.11.0rc1/doc/build-unix.md). If you want to build your own dependencies, and/or you want to build for other platforms (e.g. Windows), you can easily (cross-)compile the dependencies and Bitcoin Core itself, using the [depends system](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/v0.11.0rc1/depends/README.md), which will take care of everything, including downloading the different sources, with one command, giving you a prefix that's ready to be plugged into configure. You'll just need to install the relevant compiler/build tools for the platform you're looking to build, e.g. `sudo apt-get install g++-mingw-w64`, etc.\n\nOn a clean install of Ubuntu Precise, I needed to install the following packages to get the cross-compilation working for 64-bit Windows: `git g++-mingw-w64 autoconf libtool`, as well as `nsis` to create the installer.

This new technology kicks the middleman to the curb, and spreads that disintermediation capability to other areas of commerce (for example, eBay without eBay, aka Open Bazaar). As it stood, it was hard to see how charging exactly $0 to merchants was going to get BitPay very far.\n\nInvestors, however, want to make money by funding the next gatekeeper. Ideally, one that creates a strong monopoly.\n\nThe difference between what Bitcoin enables and what most investors want is stark. If so, there will be a lot of wreckage along the way. Investors will try to drive companies toward models that have worked in the past, leading to ruination.

BitPay had first mover advantage, but the writing is on the wall, it makes sense that they are looking for alternative monetization strategies.\n\n"Hoarding" bitcoin gives it value. Having more places where you can spend bitcoin gives it value. Price is based on supply and demand. The more people saving bitcoin, the less supply available, the higher the price goes.

': 1, "A very thoughtful article - and well written.\n\nI do think that the author is over-thinking the lack of consumer adoption and use.  As one of these 30 something males that don't spend their bitcoin - it has less to do with the fact that Bitcoin has a fixed supply, than the fact that I just can't be bothered.\n\nBesides the quantity of Bitcoin set aside for investment purposes - I could buy some additional bitcoin for spending purposes.  I almost did recently.  Having bought my original bitcoin from bitstamp, I wanted to use something that would cause less distress to my bank than the  wire to a slovenian bank account... so I signed up at coinjar.  I got to the point where I had to send in scanned docs - and I just couldn't be arsed.\n\nThe claim by the author is that the fixed supply is causing the lack of consumer use.  Well - the fixed supply is perhaps incentivising me not to spend my allotted investment.  But it's not what is stopping me from buying a usage-allotment of bitcoin for daily use.  What stops me in that respect is the simple fact that it just doesn't benefit me to do so.\n\nThe other thing that prevents me from using bitcoin for purchases is that even storing a small amount (say 50 dollars) in bitcoin is annoying from the point of view of volatility.  So if I were to use bitcoin at all for purchases - I'd buy the bitcoin specifically as I need it.  But that's just more overhead.  Effort.\n\nBitcoin isn't going to become a medium of exchange any time soon.  It's a commodity... and will be marketed as a way to securely record transactions.  Folks like the author who are sceptical that Bitcoin can play a signficant role in this respect - believing that banks will just use their own block-chains - have to bear in mind that it's not clear whether the costs of building and securing their own blockchains will be cheaper than paying fees on the bitcoin network.  \n\nNo one knows how this will play out.

Both spenders and hoarders benefit from the security paid for by the block subsidy.  When the block reward decreases significantly, security is paid for by spenders (transaction fees).  Without security there is no value. Hoarders stake their hopes on preserving value on other people transacting in bitcoin.': 1, 'That\'s my take on it. People are throwing venture capital into these startups expecting that if Bitcoin "takes off" their startup will take off as well. But for the volume and success of Bitcoin to make Bitpay a multibillion dollar company would also completely undermine their initial profit plan. So they are left pivoting and burning until they are out of niches. Personally, I wish Bitpay success as they provided a pivotal role in the history of Bitcoin (I remember some of the first posts on Reddit about the company - people were really excited).\n\nThat said, I think Swanson falls back to Keynesian/central planning economics too much to explain Bitcoin\'s lack of adoption.': 6, 'Hopefully.': 4}, ("Adam Back on the dangers of Gavin's & Mikes effort to force a unilateral non-consensus hard fork", 7): {"I explained already:\n\n>Gavin has come up against a brick wall for years.\n\nHe started floating the idea of a hard fork that doesn't have consensus with the current technical community only after the collaborative approach seemed to be going nowhere.\n": 1, "yeah...
