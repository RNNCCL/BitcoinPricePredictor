Why is nobody here talking about that.', 1): {'[deleted]': 3, 'China to allow more flexible currency to boost growth\n\nThe yuan in Shanghai is currently allowed to diverge up to 2 per cent on either side of a daily reference rate set by the People\'s Bank of China.\nThe yuan in Shanghai is currently allowed to diverge up to 2 per cent on either side of a daily reference rate set by the People\'s Bank of China. Reuters\n\nby Fion Li\n\nChina will allow the yuan to trade in a wider range against the US dollar, the State Council said, in a move that will devalue the currency and help bolster export growth.\n\nFlexibility will be increased to support trade, the cabinet said in a statement on Friday that didn\'t indicate any timing or scope for the potential adjustment. The yuan in Shanghai is currently allowed to diverge up to 2 per cent on either side of a daily reference rate set by the People\'s Bank of China.\n\nThe band was last expanded in March 2014 from 1 per cent, and before that doubled from 0.5 per cent in April 2012. It was 0.3 per cent before an adjustment in May 2007. The yuan traded in Hong Kong fell the most in almost three weeks on Friday.\n\n"The State Council is implying that the People\'s Bank of China should widen the trading band," said Andy Ji, a Singapore-based strategist at the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. "The authorities may allow the yuan to weaken to boost China\'s exports, if the PBOC reduces its intervention in the existing band."\n\nThe International Monetary fund\'s mission to China said in a statement in May that, although the yuan is no longer undervalued, it needs to be more flexible. China should limit intervention to avoiding disorderly market conditions or excessive volatility, the mission said.\n\nOf 24 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg in June, 14 forecast the trading band will be widened in 2015, up from eight out of 22 in a January poll. In a separate survey in the June 18-24 period, 11 of 16 economists predicted the IMF will add the yuan to its Special Drawing Rights this year.\n\nChina will improve the exchange rate\'s mechanism and expand the scale of yuan trade settlement, the State Council said Friday. The country will study starting more hedging tools for companies to deal with currency risks, it said.\n\n"It doesn\'t mean yuan-band widening is happening soon, but that the PBOC can make a move since the State Council has cleared it," said Li Liuyang, a Shanghai-based strategist at Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ. "Yuan depreciation is positive for domestic demand as well as exports."\n\nThe State Council announcement comes as a private gauge of Chinese manufacturing unexpectedly fell to the lowest in 15 months, reinforcing the need for further policy support in an economy that had seen signs of stabilisation recently. Regional stocks fell.\n\nThe preliminary Purchasing Managers\' Index from Caixin Media and Markit Economics was at 48.2 for July, down from 49.4 the previous month and worse than all 16 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey, where the median estimate was for an increase to 49.7. Numbers below 50 indicate contraction.\n\nThe release weakens the outlook for the world\'s second-largest economy, putting pressure on authorities to do more to meet Premier Li Keqiang\'s 2015 growth target of about 7 per cent. A slump in property investment and the recent stocks rout underscore the risks that remain even after policy makers stepped up support in recent months.\n\n"The industrial sector has seen no sign of stabilisation yet," said Xu Gao, chief economist at Everbright Securities in Beijing, adding that most of the growth stabilisation last quarter come from the services sector. "The government should further step up the policy supports, including further boosting infrastructure investment and expediting the debt swap program."\n\nThe MSCI Asia Pacific Index declined 0.7 per cent after the PMI report, heading for the lowest close since July 13. Australian shares reversed gains to trade lower. Chinese stocks dropped in Hong Kong, with the benchmark index falling for a sixth week. The Australian dollar dropped to a six-year low and the New Zealand dollar also retreated.\n\nThe decline in the manufacturing gauge contrasts with better-than-expected economic growth last quarter. China\'s gross domestic product rose 7 per cent in the three months through June from a year earlier, unchanged from the first quarter and beating economists\' estimates for 6.8 per cent. Industrial output in June rose 6.8 per cent, while fixed-asset investment increased 11.4 per cent in the first half.\n\nA surge in stock prices that helped boost financial services in the second quarter may have also masked weakness in the real economy, Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Tom Orlik and Fielding Chen said in a report on Friday. The PMI slump strengthens the case for further stimulus, they said. The equity boom turned into a rout in recent weeks.\n\n"A lot of entrepreneurs probably have invested in the stock market and now they have seen a significant loss," Liu Li-Gang, chief Greater China economist at ANZ Banking Group in Hong Kong, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. "As a result business confidence has lowered. In the past, sentiment tends to have a lot of impact on this survey."\n\nThe Caixin gauge, previously known as the HSBC PMI, may diverge further with the official PMI in the second half of the year as the government\'s support measures will first help bigger companies and state-owned enterprises, said Everbright\'s Xu.\n\nMuch like last year, a sluggish start spurred more stimulus as the government orchestrated a debt swap for provinces and the central bank accelerated monetary easing. The PBOC cut the benchmark one-year lending rate to a record low of 4.85 per cent in June.\n\n"The overall economy won\'t be that bad," said Shen Jianguang, chief Asia economist at Mizuho Securities Asia in Hong Kong. "Meanwhile, it shows that China\'s economic recovery is still mainly helped by government-backed spending, and the private sector activities remain sluggish."\n': 2, "Is it coincidence that banks who deal in non mined fiat were considering using Ripple?

If you know anything about security, you gotta admit it\'s more secure than the plain text alternatives like WhatsApp\n\nHow Julia authenticates with Coinbase has **nothing at all** to do with Telegram, the messaging part of the construct, so why are you even comparing it with WhatsApp?

Are you claiming that because one piece of software was broken we should stop striving for security in all others and just assume that our software is broken and give up? If so, Telegram may be just right for you in that case!\n\n> I think it\'s a shame this thread has turned into an argument. Is that all reddit is?

There are so many variables to consider, many of which probably haven\'t even been invented yet.\n\nIt\'s easy to accurately predict the future in retrospect.

A common argument that bitcoin will remain the most used cryptocurrency is that "not even ipv6 has been able to replace ipv4" due to the entrenched [network effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_effect) of the widely used ipv4. When the internet protocol became used by mainstream people the version number was ipv4. There exists an upgraded version of the internet protocol called ipv6, but it\'s almost never used because changing everything would be so much work, so people just keep using the "good old ipv4".\n\nIt\'s easy to look back at history and say that it\'s obvious that no successful competitor to the internet would ever cause people to stop using the internet and start using the competing computer network instead.

I worked at an IT-company and about half of the employees thought that there would be serious problems. Maybe even causing riots if the sensitive computer programs that were being used to coordinate food supply and transportation to grocery stores deep inside cities would be interrupted.\n\nSome of them withdrew a couple of weeks worth of salary in cash even, just to have cash in case the ATMs would stop working. Some even went so far as to buy a few days of canned food just in case of chaos. So no more than about 50 % of my co-workers thought that there would be no significant problems at all.\n\nAbout six months after 2000-01-01 and no significant problems had occurred, someone made fun of one of the guys for being stupid thinking that the Y2K bug would\'ve ever caused any problems and that the society had wasted all of that time and money trying to correct all the software at the time so it would not crash at midnight 2000-01-01.\n\nThat was confirmation bias right there.\n\nAll of a sudden 95 % of those same people thought that the Y2K problem had been exaggerated and a wasteful endeavour. Cobol programmers were ridiculed (Most of the most sensitive systems had their programs written in the Cobol language at the time.).\n\nBut I actually tested one of my local ATMs at about 00:45 and it didn\'t work. The guy who sold gas to me had to use the old method of making a paper copy of my debit card "because there was a problem with the computers" he said. So I\'d say it was a close call despite all those many man-hours that had been spent globally correcting all of those errors. What would\'ve happened if no one had taken the Y2K problem seriously? I think that would have been so problematic that people today would\'ve said "but of course there were riots". "The stupid politicians and economists just didn\'t see the problem that the rest of us clearly saw". Again, there would\'ve been confirmation bias.\n\nSo, I\'m very careful to just assume that the same thing that caused everyone to use the internet instead of competitors to the internet, will also surely cause everyone to use bitcoin instead of a future competitor to bitcoin. Assuming that would be a form of confirmation bias.\n\nWith that said, I still hold mainly bitcoin with a tiny percentage of namecoin as a hedge if it would turn out I\'m wrong about bitcoin. Those are the only two cryptocurrencies I\'ve ever invested in.\n\n**tldr: I don\'t know, and I think that question is too complex for anyone to know.** Be careful with confirmation bias from other similar historical events, and invest in bitcoin only what you\'re comfortable losing. Bitcoin can replace the USD as the reserve currency, but can also itself be replaced by any future invention or fail for any other reason due to the high complexity of the question, causing bitcoin\'s value to crash to zero. We can\'t know, so invest carefully, but do invest at least what you consider to be a little. Bitcoin is an exciting invention with the same disruptive potential as the internet invention itself.': 1, "winklevoss makes me giggle every time.

Now, the Bitcoin price has (kind of) stabilized, and the difficulty is sometimes adjusted upward, sometimes downward. Also, the hash rate has flattened. This indicates that there are no net entrants into the total mining pool. That means that the profit is low enough that it is no longer profitable to enter the pool, and as many drop out as enter. This means that a halving of the reward will make it unprofitable for *everyone* (unless they already own the capital equipment and electricity and cooling are essentially free).': 1, 'Your fears are justified in that it will not look pretty in the international news.\n\nI expect a huge bubble will form from it again.

Will it advantage one set of users and disadvantage another? Will the miner\'s profit at the halving be marginal (less than, say, 10%), such that after the halving, profit-motivated miners will shut down until the difficulty adjusts, but the time to adjustment of difficulty will soar because so few miners are operating? Markets don\'t like uncertainty.\n\nOnce again, let me suggest that the block reward should be adjusted more smoothly so that the effects of the change in reward are distributed over time, rather than occurring in one (possibly disastrous) event every four years. Properly done, this would have no effect on the 21 million number of total bitcoins eventually created, or the overall rate of creation.': 2, "I hope you're correct, because there is no chance that the reward will be smoothed before the next halving.\n\nWe're gonna see whether my doomsday fears are justified.": 1}, ("The Times 3/Jan/2009 -- Satoshi's Genesis Block newspaper.", 0): {'The online version headline is worded slightly differently.

GambleCoin also happens to accept 1 confirmation before payment. Mr 1% Miner usually makes ~25BTC one average once every 100 blocks, now he is interested in attacking due to his greed. He asks GambleCoin for a payment address and starts mining 1.1MB blocks including a transaction paying 500BTC to that address. Eventually he creates a "fake conf" block that appears valid to GambleCoin and 50% of the time he wins.\n\nThis time he happens to win and he rebroadcasts his transaction paying 500BTC to GambleCoin and GambleCoins payment of 1000BTC to him to the rest of the network so it ends up in the actual mainchain. Mr 1% Miners block is reorged out and he is left with a gain of 500BTC and a loss of 25BTC, for a total profit of 475BTC.\n\nNext block he loses and instead rebroadcasts a new doublespend transaction to the main network, while GambleCoin sits and happily enjoys their 500BTC payment in the fake conf block. Unfortunate for GambleCoin, when this confirmation is removed and the 1.1MB block reorged out, GambleCoin is left without the payment. Mr 1% Miner loses no Bitcoins from the bet, but loses 25BTC in block reward, for a total loss of 25BTC.\n\nEvery iteration of this has an E[X] of (475 + (-25))/2 = 225BTC.

This can be used for double-spending. If attacker can make sure that his transaction only get into 8 MB blocks (which isn't hard), he will get 100% successful 1-confirmation double-spend once each 40 minutes.\n\nSo you need to wait more confirmations... Probability of 2-confirmation payment being orphaned is 6.25% and probability of 3-confirmation payment orphaning is 1.5%. Note that it doesn't mean probability of an attack is 1.5%, an attack can be 100% successful, this number only affects how much time attacker needs to wait.\n\nBTC-E accepts funds after 3 confirmations, so this attack could be used against BTC-E if they were using node configured to accept 8 MB blocks.

However it decreases others. \n\nIn the end if the coin does what the market asks it to, then that expresses itself as higher coin value, which ultimately increases Bitcoin security.

The core developers do not - anyone can fork the code to ignore the core developers if they remain intransigent.\n\nIn a broader sense, miners are constrained by the need to respect the views of the non miners, because if the miners alter some parameter that destroys the economic parameters of Bitcoin, the users can and would move very quickly to an alt-coin.\n\nIf >50% of them agree on some form of software change that relaxes or removes the 1Mb limit ... then eventually that will be the dominant fork of the block chain...  the higher the % that is in the majority group of miners, the more savage the economic pressure on the other miners is.  That is why the current suggestion is for the change to kick in at 75% of recent blocks indicating support for the revised limit.\n\nNon miners have a different issue, they need to ensure they always follow the majority of the hash power and the parameters that group of miners agree on.\n\nAnd for anyone who is not a miner, but wants to have zero impact on their business, it makes a huge amount of sense to switch to the XT (0.11) code base as soon as Mike Hearn releases it.\n\nWhy?\n\n* If the consensus is NOT reached, you are **unaffected**.\n* If the consensus IS reached, you are **unaffected**.\n\nSwitching to XT (0.11) is a zero risk choice.... staying with Bitcoin core means risking disruption if consensus IS reached.\n\nI have already switched to XT - and if the world gets around to a consensus, I will be unaffected.': 22, 'Miners invariably run their own node, or for pooled mining, the pool runs a node.

In any case it won\'t be economical for a miner to engage in such an attack since it would probably be more profitable to mine a block that would generate an coinbase that can be spent on a majority of the network/nodes.\n\nIf you run a node that accepts bigger blocks - don\'t use a wallet on it - or if you do us a wallet on it - don\'t trust just a few confirmations on that node to be sure it won\'t be overrun.\n\nTL;DR; Running an node without wallet that accepts bigger blocks have no security implications or issues - other then possible being banned by other peers/nodes.': 0}, ('A CoinFest Conundrum: Privacy VS Transparency (A Crypto Problem)', 0): {}, ('What is requited to enable bitcoin payments in an app?', 2): {'You can do either as well as combine both of these approaches (parts being outsourced and parts doing yourself).
