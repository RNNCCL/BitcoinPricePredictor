If your startup won\'t hold customer funds, you don\'t need a BitLicense anyway.\n\nBitcoin innovators were already facing this type of regulation; now it\'s clear what needs to be specifically done with respect to bitcoin. Nobody expected to be able to operate an unregulated US-based exchange service of any type because the law *already* required licensing for it; now the licensing for bitcoin-specific activity is made clear and innovators that feared being shut out of their industry by future regulations have a road map of how to proceed.\n\nSure, a separate "BitLicense" on top of a traditional MTL makes no sense, but at least now people know if they will need it which lifts the barrier to innovation that\'s been in place here in the US for years.\n\nSure, the license isn\'t cheap; but neither are the ~~federal and~~ state money transmitter licenses.

Actually, it isn\'t going to hinder Bitcoin development at all because the only clearly defined part of the bill is the part that defines **who is affected**. That\'s simple: the only people affected are entities that hold or transmit bitcoin *for their customers*. This is not 99% of business and the rest of the world has nothing to worry about. BitLicense legitimizes the use of bitcoin as a payment mechanism for businesses and specifically does not restrict them.\n\n> Now, if your startup model includes holding or exchanging crypto for your customers, then you might want to consider the impact of BitLicense. Other than that, no need to worry; you won\'t be affected.\n\n> If you\'re still worried, read the definition in the BitLicense of a Virtual Currency Business Activity - the entire license procedure *only* applies to businesses that engage specifically in money transmission. If your business doesn\'t meet one of those descriptions, you won\'t have to get a BitLicense. If it does, you probably already have AML/KYC/FinCEN procedures or registration in place, so BitLicense is not a huge stretch for you anyway.\n\n**edit** Wow, thanks for the insightful counterpoints!

SEPA is also not a payment method, it is a class of payments which are mandated to have certain criteria - chief amongst them being that they must credit, at the latest, the working day after they are sent.

There is however no KYC. As a result people can use tumblers/coin mixers to preform off chain transaction where they are swaping pseudonyms amongst various individuals to hide the path between A and B. \n\nNow tumblers will be effective at hiding the transactions of small amounts (relative to thefts that have occurred) but any large amount (few million dollars) can't be easily tumbled simply from there not being enough volume (the person looking to tumble as a result gets some of their own coins back). So this means massive amounts are easily traced. But with no KYC they can hide in the public without anyone knowing who the thief is. Then small amounts over time can be tumbled from this and later spent or hidden in different wallets. \n\nSo small thefts are easy to hide large ones can still hide in public. \n": 1, 'Yes, once the owner of a wallets address is identified, it\'s pretty easy to analyze that users activties, at least as far as they pertain to that address. The thing is, it\'s trivial to create a new address to move the coins to, or, more likely, 100 or 1,000 new addresses.\n\nWithout an identifier, though, it\'s futile, and we\'ve seen wannabe blockchain "sleuths" waste time and energy trying to identify owners of wallets without any additional information - i recall the Sheep Marketplace heist, and the ensuing chase by a couple "community" members... They ended up doxxing people completely unrelated to that market or the theft, and chased the coins into an exchanges wallet. \n\nWith Bitcoin, there exists no central authority to enforce requirements for things such as identification. To the lay user who relies on third-party "wallet" services and furnishes their identification, yes, coins received by or sent from their addresses are attributable.\n\nFor people that manage their own wallets, be it with the official client (Bitcoin-qt), Electrum, Armory, etc, they can create an unlimited amount of addresses, and none of them need to be registered or disclosed to any regulators or authorities.\n\nReally, what the blockchain can do is allow authorities, plaintiffs, etc, the ability to work backwards. If they arrest the perpetrator of a scam (say, they provided their email address, or someone was able to determine their IP address), an analysis of the wallets on his/her computer can reveal the exact course that they traveled... In the case of a ponzi operator, looking at the fragment of one coin in their wallet could help determine who the investor was (say, they purchased the coins they wanted to invest with via Coinbase or Circle), and you could see ponzi payments to other "investors", before the operator took their cut.\n\nThis turned out to be a ramble... i"m sorry, it\'s late.\n\nTLDR - Blockchain analysis can be a great tool to use after a suspect has been identified or arrested. But until that suspect takes an action that links his or her IRL identity to any of the wallet addresses they control, there\'s no sure fire way to identify the wallet owner.
