Braintree and Stripe) have already figured it out, but box store merchants aren't usually using Braintree and Stripe, but rather whatever system their banks give them.

Notice that I said was, that\'s because I\'m sorry to say Satoshi Nakamoto was murdered by Gavin Andresen and his CIA associates.

Let me explain, the CIA gives money, guns and drugs to terrorists so they can do things like stage a coup and overthrow governments this is well documented. The CIA saw the transparency of bitcoin and got the idea to start using bitcoin as one of the ways they fund these dirty subordinates. \n\nGavin was given the task of identifying Satoshi and flipping on him which he did. Once Satoshi was found and about to be captured I was informed 1 of 2 things happened, Satoshi committed suicide or the authorities were successful in capturing Satoshi and Satoshi was tortured and then killed.

Gavin Andresen was to use his position in the community to pass this off.

The CIA got used to pulling these tactics on the general population but they didn\'t understand something this transparent wouldn\'t work against the bitcoin Community since it\'s much more tech savvy.\n\nThis was one of the saddest stories that I have known about for a while and I think it needs to get out there.
