We need a solution that allows scaling up fairly rapidly when widespread adoption occurs, but not just to accommodate no-fee spam transactions that expand the blockchain pointlessly.\n\nI believe the best solution relies on the miners, the individuals and organizations that secure the Bitcoin network, to act in their best interest and use their best judgment based on what\'s occurring in the outside world.\n\nI suggest allowing the miner\'s to "vote" on the maximum blocksize by indicating in each mined block their preferred value.  At each difficulty increase (every 2016 blocks), the new maximum blocksize becomes the median value of all those votes.  Unlike some of the other proposals floating around, using the median value is not only an elegant solution, and not calendar-based, but is also immune to any kind of 21% attack.\n\nI\'m not sure it\'s necessary, but this could be coupled with limits of how slowly or quickly the maximum block size could change, for example limiting any change to a factor of two in either direction from the previews value.  This could be coupled with an overriding minimum of 1MB, but again I doubt that would be necessary.\n\nNote that this allows the community to continuously adjust the maximum blocksize, eliminating the need for future hard forks.  By community, I\'m not referring to those who post the most in the forums, but to those who invest time and money into mining equipment.  You make your wishes known by pointing to a pool with a reasonable policy.  The power doesn\'t all lie with the miners, either, since exchanges could "vote" by giving preferred rates to newly mined coins from pools with a policy they like, traders and payment processors could use exchanges that promote reasonable policies, and so on.

Scalability is an issue, but there is also a consideration of decentralization.  This method could come at a huge cost to decentralization.  We all know what that results in.  \n\nPrior to the Lightning Network, it was practically a foregone conclusion that the only way to scale Bitcoin is to increase the Block cap.  However, developers were reluctant to do so because of the cost to decentralization.  Because of the introduction of the LN, it may prove unnecessary to increase the block cap.  Moreover, it may actually preempt implementation of the LN, which promises to be a far more elegant scaling solution.  \n\nSo, yes, while at first glance this image may appear sensible, you are kind of wrong in your thinking.': 1, 'I like the sigmodial curve of this proposal.': 1, 'Adoption cannot be measured as raw txs in the blockchain, so apples to oranges really.\n\nTo date, adoption has been steady.

If you are willing to accept that mining be only profitable if you have access to a lot of bandwidth, it's not an issue; if you're threat model requires it to be possible to mine on shitty, but anonymous, internet connections it's much harder. The threat is pretty clear: **governments want to regulate mining and use mining pools to implement blacklists and force changes to the Bitcoin protocol such as requiring transactions to have identity information attached. Spend any time talking to regulators at fintech conferences and you'll hear this.**\n\n> Right now we have a pretty solid defense: we can honestly tell those regulators to fuck off, because if they're dumb enough to try regulating mining pools will just go underground and run off Tor sites and other highly censorship resistant - but bandwidth poor - communications mediums. More importantly, the profitability of mining pools that use such mediums is still high, because the amount of bandwidth you need to mine profitably is low. Equally, unlike proposals such as Gavin's IBLT, that's true even if other mining pools are trying to make you unprofitable. (with IBLT while block propagation is O(1) in the best case, other miners have an incentive to sabotage you, resulting in O(n) propagation, and them earning more money)\n\n> With higher blocksizes at some point this defense doesn't work: **mining pools that are out in the open are easy to regulate with legal tools, yet they are also significantly more profitable than the unregulated pools because they have access to much faster internet connections**. Since small % changes in revenue matter a lot to the slim profit margins inherent in mining, we'll see hashing power shift to regulated pools, and blacklists, whitelists, and other government mandated changes become possible to enforce.\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/33oz97/just_merged_pruning_support_in_bitcoin_core_run_a/cqn6tas": 2, 'Currently blocks would anyways be capped at ~32(?)

Ultimately, no one can just claim away what they might be doing, and it\'s the _secret_ relationships, which you don\'t know about which are usually the greatest dangers. It\'s unfortunate that those who are frank get attacked, while the question isn\'t even drawn about those with more opaque.  But it is an interesting and important area, which is why I don\'t just ignore the question-- even when posed by obvious sockpuppet accounts.\n\nOne challenge is a common piece of confusion in modern English usage. What is a "conflict of interest"?-- it\'s a situation when incentives aren\'t aligned, and might cause someone to act out of one interest when they should act out of another. But it\'s also commonly used to describe actually acting unethically due to a conflict of interest.  At some threshold conflicts of interest are impossible to avoid: no two people perfectly share incentives. Unethical actions, on the other hand, are avoidable and when they might be encouraged we can reduce their risk by being frank about potential conflicts and deploying mitigations.\n\nIn the case of Blockstream we are highly incentivized for Bitcoin\'s success and we\'ve taken concrete moves to help amplify that alignment (mentioned in the posts), e.g. setting up every employee with timelocked bitcoins (on top of their prior personal bitcoin ownership, of course). We\'ve insured the the staff with commit access can quit and continue to get paid if blockstream misbehaves, etc. But does a potential for a conflict exist? Absolutely! One also exists for lose assorted developers and in any other arrangement you could imagine. We\'ve made what mitigations we could think of (and are always open to more), and been open and frank about what we\'re working on. The way we act in the outside world is through free and open software that people voluntarily choose to use.\n\nWhat about in this discussion of block-size specifically?  Many of our views on this subject are firmly historically documented since long before Blockstream was ever thought about, in my case-- for example:  https://en.bitcoin.it/w/index.php?title=Scalability&action=historysubmit&diff=14273&oldid=14112 and in the time since many indicators have gone in directions that suggest, if anything, we need to more concerned about the security impact here (increased consolidation in mining, activity in miners seeking regulatory approval, miners operating without verification, decline in node counts, increase commercial reliance on third party services).\n\nIf anything, the causality is reversed here: Blockstream was founded by some of the most active inventors and engineers working on low level bitcoin infrastructure because we believed that we needed a sustainable source of funding for technical infrastructure-- the BCF approach was clearly not working for that-- to take it to the next level, and we\'ve already published as free a lot of very good stuff. Perhaps we\'re wrong about what was needed, but the view of what was needed clearly came first before a commercial interest. Do we employ a lot of people who\'ve worked on Bitcoin? Sure, and we\'re proud of it. To do so, we expanded the space of people working full time on Bitcoin, we didn\'t go and aggressively poach out all the talent from elsewhere.\n\nAnd our (assorted) views on this aren\'t unusual. Take a look at the recent [open letter](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/21809/open-letter-bitcoin-community-developers/) for an example-- we stand in common with the vast majority of active contributors to Bitcoin at a low level, people who have had nothing to do with blockstream. And the participants there hugely outnumber non-participants, even if you drop out all the blockstream folks.\n\nNone of our business plans depend or are improved through smaller blocks except through the angle of existential risk to Bitcoin, and that if Bitcoin loses security our work on it loses value. This is especially the case for the kinds of small constant factor changes that can be argued for right with a straight face by anyone.  E.g. the work in sidechains is about flexibility that has no comparison to block size-- e.g. being able to make coins strongly fungible or smart contracts arbitrarily powerful.  Lightning transactions are a true scalablity improvement for bitcoin, indeed, but the kind of improvement they can offer isn\'t just a 8x or what have you, but tens of thousands of times, along with instant confirmation and the potential for improved privacy.\n\nIs it possible for things to turn another way in the future, even without us realizing it? It absolutely is. But this is also why we have our most powerful mitigation, our work is free and open source software whos behavior anyone can directly evaluate and we don\'t have direct power over anyone except via their voluntary decision to work with us or use what we\'ve given away.\n\nI hope this answered some of your concerns, and I\'m always open to hearing about more of them, especially clear and actionable ones, in order to seek out ways they can be mitigated.\n\nSo let me TLDR this:\n\nEveryone has a dog in this fight, and potential conflicts of interest-- including Blockstream. On our part we try to mitigate with special incentives that no other company in this space seems to try to put in place and with openess and frankness that, frankly, others are lacking. We do this because we understand, deeply, the importance of the openness and a lack of authoritarian control are integral to the value the Bitcoin provides to the world.  Our opinions about the critical importance of actual scalablity arose out of our work on Bitcoin long before Blockstream and are well documented, but there is always a potential for them to have been artificially hardened (both by our work and by concerted attacks against us); though we share our views generally in common with the vast majority of developers community working on low level bitcoin infrastructure (Blockstream is also not a monolith, and we have a diversity of views: But most do seem to prioritize managing the existential risk of a lost of Bitcoin\'s security properties due to inadequate scalablity plus too much scale relative to it). I think it\'s important to acknowledge the risks from potential conflicts of interest we have, and I wish more other parties would do the same. I hope that strong technology and technical reasoning, cooperation, and communication will overcome political disputes and allow collaboration towards the common goals that we all share.\n': 10, 'Censorship incoming...': -5}, ('Dynamic blocksize proposal with some resistance to manipulation.', 0): {'Seems reasonable.': 1, 'This is just a more complex form of miner voting (BIP100)': 1}, ('OKCoin no longer accepting BTC deposits from US users', 0): {'New Chinese [enforcement of already extant] capital controls maybe?

It seems quite primitive to me, but it seems obvious that there's a market there. Higher transaction fees have been paid before, sometimes from old defaults, sometimes from a deliberate attempt to ensure quality-of-service on confirmations. There have got to be miners out there recognizing higher transaction fees for higher priority inclusion.\n\nThat's a market.\n\nNow, could it be more sophisticated? Without question. Most clients provide little to no visibility to current market conditions on the fee market. But any serious client does and should allow for higher fees to be set, with the expectation this may be necessary or useful at times.\n\nI haven't done it on bitcoin, personally, but I've done similar on a clonecoin which is just a skin off an old bitcoin core.\n\nHigher fees can be useful. I'm not sure how that's not a market.\n\nIn prior stress tests, and I would presume this one too, high (significantly higher than the spam rate) transaction fee transactions would not be stuck this long.\n\nAren't most pools intelligent enough to implement this sort of logic, regardless of what portions are in core or not?

Then, one must either wait on confirmations, or provide extra blockchain-based guarantees by, say, locking funds up according to some protocol like that of the Lightning Network.\n\nHowever, there is a lot more honesty in the world than Bitcoin assumes, and that honesty can be exploited to everyone's benefit; that's why people trust zero-confirmation transactions at all.\n\nUnfortunately, a good model depends on a lot of issues that are not yet standardized or fixed; transaction malleability, whether a recipient reuses addresses, whether chaining of unconfirmed transactions is to be permitted, etc., all factor into the discussion.\n\nAt a minimum, it seems silly to rely on the conventions of the Bitcoin network nodes; those conventions could change at any time, or they could be stifling to some legitimate use-case (like resubmitting a stuck transaction with a higher fee).

As it is, it is still stacked towards decreasing or remaining static.\n\nNotably, a major flaw of the 21% threshold is that if a majority of the miners insisted on increasing the block size, they could force the matter by simply refusing to build on the blocks that vote below their desired threshold, and that would cause slow/unstable confirmations and frequent chain reorgs. I believe it would be better to acknowledge this fact by designing the algorithm around it.': 2, 'BIP101 allows P2P block messages to be >32MB : https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3in5mm/psa_correction_to_btcchina_letter_which_states/': 9, 'In 2036, 8 GB blocks might be nothing.': 4, "I think I will if I think I can add to the discussion.
