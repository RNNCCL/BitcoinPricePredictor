Schneier's example was one of simple counting.  Why would an irreversible calculation imply information loss in this context?": 1, 'The argument about a minimum amount of energy comes from a minimum amount of energy required to delete a bit of information. If the calculation is irreversible, it implies information is lost and hence heat is required. \n\nQuantum computing is reversible. That is, from the output, you can always compute the input. No information is therefor lost/deleted so the argument no longer applies. \n\n\n> If no information is erased, computation may in principle be achieved which is thermodynamically reversible, and require no release of heat. This has led to considerable interest in the study of reversible computing.\n\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landauer%27s_principle': 1, "What makes you think quantum computers will crack SHA256?\n\nBruce Schneier doesn't seem to think so. *Applied Cryptography* (pp. 157\xe2\x80\x938):\n\n>    One of the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics is that a certain amount of energy is necessary to represent information. To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than kT, where T is the absolute temperature of the system and k is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)\n\n>    Given that k = 1.38\xc3\x9710-16 erg/\xc2\xb0Kelvin, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2\xc2\xb0Kelvin, an ideal computer running at 3.2\xc2\xb0K would consume 4.4\xc3\x9710-16 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.\n\n>    Now, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21\xc3\x971041 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7\xc3\x971056 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all its energy for 32 years, without any loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2192. Of course, it wouldn't have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.\n\n>    But that's just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 1051 ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.\n\n>    These numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow.

They are just as unreal and virtually as Greek debt. The new Internet currency Bitcoin promises as more stability. Bitcoins can even save the Greeks? Our author interviewed Max and Stefan from Bitcoin shop in Graz.\n\nClemens setting\n\nOn the western Pacific island of Yap there is a traditional currency called Rai, who has an unusual property. Your units are small objects like coins, but extremely heavy stone disks of black aragonite. If, as money is supposed to do, go after the owner of a business transaction, it is far too expensive to move them from one place to another. So is simply determined that this and that stone is now part of this or that person. It tells a new story about the stone, and this is shared by all. Some of the Rai stones are even on the seabed. For decades, it has seen no more, but they are still in active payment cycle.\n\nMoney is a well-told story. To his handling we have only words and their interpretation, agreements and trust issues. There were times when concrete objects were behind the money, about the gold, which, due to its scarcity value. Today the currencies of the world live largely independent, emancipated, they are unreal, postmodern essence, identical to their interpretation and nothing else. What exactly are, for example, those debts, to meet which the new SYRIZA government in Greece seems unusual ways and words to choose? Who exactly is missing the money?\n\nIn the small candy shop behind the elevated train, Lawrence Ferlinghetti wrote in a poem that he had fallen in love for the first time in the unreality: the penny candy gates beyond the El is where I first fell in love with unreality. When I entered the small Bitcoin shop on the corner, I had a few days previously discovered in my district in Graz, I had a similar feeling: pleasant unreality. On a shelf are books about money and economic theory, and a small ATM, the swallows Euros and Bitcoins paid digital, waiting in a corner. I speak with Max and Stefan, the two business owners, both mid-thirties and operate coinfinity for about half a year. Directly opposite there is a night bar, in the little street there are also antique shops and hairdressers. The small Bitcoin store has great charm, because his vision is unexpected: calculated in Graz, the capital of Austria seniors who are still living off their avant-garde past. And just Bitcoins, this supposedly "not really existing" Internet Money - now suddenly there is a real local business that you can enter. It looks almost like a magic trick.\n\nWhether the store was the only one in Austria, I ask. Yes, right now already. What confront the people who come in under Bitcoins before? Anything said Max, it was really all there, every knowledge, every part of society, every age, every prejudice. The interest was overall very large. Some believe the store is a branch of the "official Bitcoin company", which simply does not exist. An official company would be just the opposite of the Bitcoin basic thought of decentralization. The crypto coins live, as the Rai-stones of Yap, on their own seabed. You can not go visit there. The seabed is called "block chain", each virtual coin there has their home. The block chain is at the heart of the Bitcoin program, it is the visual for each chronology of all previous transactions. No one "has" saved a Bitcoin at home or on his computer. Anything that can have a Bitcoin owner, is a story: the access to some Bitcoins, the "private key". This he can lose, it can be stolen or made known careless.\n\nThe deconstruction of the current monetary system\n\nNew Bitcoins arise from the fact that users provide their network processor performance. They help in the encryption and decryption of transactions. One can imagine it as "real" work that helps to stabilize the economic zone of the country (transport, infrastructure, security), and is paid for with a reward. This exposure of new Bitcoins are called "mining". Who calculates the encryption successfully receives Bitcoins and handling charges of all calculated transactions.\n\nThe amount of ersch\xc3\xbcrfbaren at the end of Bitcoins is limited to twenty-one million. Over time, there are fewer and fewer bitcoins as a reward. Also, the amount of money on Yap stones is limited, since no new ones made since the 19th century. The result, at least in theory, to deflation, an increase in value.\n\nSounds complicated. But we compare the answers with those we have just heard the same questions over traditional currencies. Where exactly are the euro, which one has in the account? This question is as trivial as unanswerable, because normal bank money is, as everyone knows, is not exactly located. The saver "has" it, and the bank lends it on, so it even start dancing at two weddings at the same time. The account holder has the right to access it and convert it into paper money, but that only applies to the case that this do not have too many account holders at the same time. In addition, the money earned by the Bank from someone else\'s liability. Traditional money is therefore a dizzying flickering as elementary particles. The mechanisms of generating money and the determination of the circulating amount are dark and hard to explain. You have to be an insider of the ECB or the Federal Reserve in order to really be able to say, are the reasons behind what decision. Bitcoins live at least to a certain place within the program, such as the stones on Yap, immovable.\n\nI ask Max if they previously were able to record financial success with their business model of a real Bitcoin store. Not so really, he says. But it all stand still at the beginning. It also walk him more to the political dimension. Therefore, the supposedly God-given to deconstruct the current monetary system. About the idea that inflation is necessary and inevitable. Each monetary system is merely a convention. Bitcoins are not the solution to all existing problems, but you can finally try something different, a real alternative, decentralized, not off. The program does not exist in a place that no authority can modify it or prohibit. No matter what kind of society you live, you can participate in the same transaction network.\n\nOn several occasions, Max and Stefan visited the shops in the district to explain to them the benefits of Bitcoins. In the retail trade and restaurants and bars around this fails mostly on existing POS system which allows a transition appear too complicated. The first success was Mr Siegfried, who runs a food stall in the market hall on Lendplatz. The have the Bitcoin app available for immediate download and use it ever since. Mr. Siegfried had announced that Stefan says, that there would be with him when Bitcoins again reach a value of one thousand dollars, a big party. But most people are not as open-minded as Siegfried says Max. It is also generally difficult to bring the issue to the neutral language. You go into a store, buy something, stand at the checkout ... It WOULD always strange people suddenly without asking to talk about Bitcoins.

The fluctuations do not act as a deterrent, says Max. Man is but a joyous adventure, greedy beings. Stefan adds: "Everyone always says: Bitcoins are so volatile But one might also ask:.? Why the euro\'s so volatile compared with Bitcoins It sounds maybe stupid, but of course these problems of extreme price fluctuations exist only at the interface traditional currencies. "\n\nThis reminds me of something I read recently, the history of the Brazilian real. Before him was the currency of Cruzeiro, and experienced for decades an unstoppable inflation incredible 80 percent per month. There was even a specific profession: the Preiserh\xc3\xb6her. This man went to the end of the month by the supermarkets and replaced the price tags with the new higher prices. Like a shark a school of fish he drove the shoppers in front of it, the more quickly grabbed items with the lower price. Experienced psychotherapists masse feed, people had nightmares of depreciation and futility. Nothing retained its value, all melted away the same as wet sand. - To return the people\'s confidence in the local currency, they invented a virtual currency, the URV (unidade real de valor) that are not circulated, but was only on pay slips and price tags and tax returns. Paid was still in the impossible, constantly depreciating cruzeiro, the exchange rate between the URV and cruzeiro changed according to the extreme inflation. But what did not change was the surrender value of a URV: A bar of chocolate tasted in URV always the same. So that people lived for a while, watching both. Then, in 1994, it said: Okay, let\'s forget the stupid Cruzeiro, burns the worthless stuff, we now simply print URVs and call it Real! For the people was the only change to the stupid conversion Cruzeiro - no longer had to make real, everything else remained the same, wages, taxes and prices, the behavior of the real them had long been familiar and familiar from the paper here. With this brilliant psychological trick inflation in Brazil was eliminated.\n\nI ask Stefan and Max, if a similar scenario for bitcoins would also be possible. They are skeptical. It would currently still hard to imagine Bitcoins perfect emancipation from traditional currencies, though, so Max, this is inevitable. But there are already experimenting with price stability. And in an area where price stability is pretty much the most subversive idea that you can imagine: the art market. "Cointemporary" means the project. This work of art in an online gallery for a week at a constant value of Bitcoin (\xc3\xa0 la URV) are offered. Depending on how does the Euro to Bitcoins will result in a bargain or the opposite. What was the state in the Brazilian case, here is an artist.\n\nLocal, short-term URVs. Perhaps the future of crypto-currencies is a state as defined by the Brazilians were usual just before the introduction of the Real 1994: monetary bilingualism. You might think in Cruzeiro (really there, but constantly losing its value) and URV (stable, but only virtually). Stefan tells that there is in the US companies only pay their suppliers and employees in Bitcoins, but also there\'s the dollars behind it visible.\n\n\nBitcoin trading derivatives\n\nAnd Greece? Could it transitional completely convert to bitcoins? No, that would be crazy. An exit from the euro zone would have a capital loss and massive foreign exchange purchase consequence. Belarus has, during the ruble descent, a 30 percent tax introduced recently to purchase foreign exchange to prevent it. But what if there was a specially created alternative currency, Greek crypto-coins? A second official, digital national currency, perhaps even one that I imagine, at the transaction fees, the State mitverdient, but that is not associated with the international banking system. Nationalized crypto-currencies - a perverse idea. But at least radically. And feasible.\n\nThe longer the conversation, the more I get the feeling that the invisible Bitcoins are less unreal than normal money. But still they are a small, manageable biotope with a total value of five billion dollars. Every beginning always appears ensouled freedom and opportunities. The ambitious operators of the first Internet companies in the early nineties, it must have gone like that. The poet Stefan George commented in 1920 on the idea of \xe2\x80\x8b\xe2\x80\x8ba portable pocket phone: "It interests me because it\'s independent of the state."\n\nThe world is becoming more and more a to the new crypto-currencies. The idealistic community, which is concerned with freedom and an alternative is embedded in larger contexts. In the US, is being built with Bitcoin trading derivatives. And more recently even allows Paypal transactions in BTC. Their extreme ease of use is irresistible. You do not even have a program for it. You can, if you will, the access key that allows you to Bitcoins has access, print on paper and put it in the safe. You can even memorize it and literally carry around all assets in your own brain with it.\n\nBut what if the block chain is getting bigger and bigger and their calculation so high processor performance requires that no normal user can perform more? Then "supernode" could arise a few enormously powerful computer, of whom all others would be dependent. Such a supernode would be pretty much the same as a modern bank. They had the power to refuse unwanted transactions.\n\nCould actually the structures that would allow the creators of Bitcoins behind forever, replicate by itself within the system? Who will still operate mining at the end and how? Who would have the necessary resources? Large companies that use their own data centers for Bitcoins. And maybe States.\n\nBut who knows. Unlike a priori state-managed money for Bitcoins the roads are still open.\n\nIn the heart of Bitcoins is the issue of trust. Individual users need the person to whom they give their private key, trust. But how do you do that? The gap between men\'s always insurmountable.\n\nCould you encrypt the private key itself? Yes, you can come up with a phrase that has never ever told in the history of mankind, and calculate a private key. I suspect that this is quite difficult. Everything we say, was probably already said. Nothing new under the sun. Max contrary, it is very easy to say anything that was ever said in the history of mankind. "Clemens, Max and Stefan sitting in coinfinity office and talk about Bitcoins." I\'m perplexed. Yes, that\'s right. But a lingering doubts remain. Intelligent bots can guess all day. Really everything? Oh, there\'s always the point where combinatorial considerations in theological threaten to transform.\n\nHow can I use Bitcoins?\n\n\n\nOn the computer a so-called client must be installed, a program for managing the currency. For example, multi, Electrum or Armory. It is also available for Android smartphones. To open an account, it does not need any personal information.\n\nThe program creates a file named wallet, the wallet. In addition, it creates a public and a private key. The public key is used as an address and looks for example like this: 1EQodj2MkD6iL5X4MZ7Pc6kWMArF7moW6E. It gives the user an account number as that with which he or act of which he wants to receive bitcoins.\n\nThe secret key is known only to the user better. With it, he identifies himself in the Bitcoin network. The secret key is needed to send Bitcoins can. This is as easy as online banking. If the secret key, however, spied on, the account can be emptied. Anyone wanting to use Bitcoins, so you have to deal with it, such keys to keep them safely and use. Bitcoin is just one of many crypto currencies. Alternatives such as Litecoin, Peercoin or Dogecoin function but similar.\n\nWhere can I get Bitcoins?\n\nThe easiest way is to buy them. Special offer exchanges current exchange rates and sell Bitcoins for a surcharge. More about the first steps is listed here. Who wants to exchange bitcoins in dollars, euros or yen, which also can do about these exchanges. Also, the cost of course fees. Some vendors charge the substitute money on debit cards. The assets of the owner may then withdraw from ATMs or equal to use a special Bitcoin machines. Other transfer it.\n\nThe second way is to generate Bitcoins itself, called mining. The capacity of your own computer are placed here on the Internet. Many computers do together in common complex computing tasks. As a result, Bitcoins are created and then raffled among the participating computers. For making money that is good only conditionally. The tasks are so complex that a commercially available computer would need to own several years. Who wants can rent or buy specialized mining machines.\n\n\nWhat are the problems?\n\n\n\nBitcoins are a new idea. Like all new ideas they represent proven systems in question and take technical, but also many legal problems. They are not considered as legal tender. It is not even clear whether they are legal property. Because they can not really steal - the "thief" merely peeking a code key and thus makes a referral.\n\nTechnically, it is impossible to make payments reversed, the system prevents the transmitter may cancel such a transfer. For buyers, this means a higher risk than in previous systems, to a lesser seller. Since the identity can be concealed with transfers, criminals use Bitcoins to evade taxes example. The American financial authority monitors the currency, therefore, to track money laundering.\n\nEconomically, it is unclear how the limited money supply affects and what effects this has on trading prices.

If prove ownership of one of these microBTC, you can take 1oz of gold out of the vault.\n\nIf this is your question then the answer is that in that case we WANT fungibility to be disrupted.  Because those 100 microBTC individually have additional value "attached" to them, we need to be able to track and distinguish them from other microBTC.  There\'s nothing special about BTC to do this.  You could write "this note entitles the bearer to 1 cheeseburger" on a dollar bill and give it to someone.

Futuristic technology comprised of a glass screen in your pocket to access your terminal remotely.  Wasn\'t that far-fetched.  Don\'t be so quick to dismiss strong technologies (such as bitcoin)': 1, 'This was posted by "targetpro" and as far as I can see, it is correct: \n\nWhat makes you think quantum computers will crack SHA256?\n\nBruce Schneier doesn\'t seem to think so. Applied Cryptography (pp. 157\xe2\x80\x938):\n\nOne of the consequences of the second law of thermodynamics is that a certain amount of energy is necessary to represent information. To record a single bit by changing the state of a system requires an amount of energy no less than kT, where T is the absolute temperature of the system and k is the Boltzman constant. (Stick with me; the physics lesson is almost over.)\n\nGiven that k = 1.38\xc3\x9710-16 erg/\xc2\xb0Kelvin, and that the ambient temperature of the universe is 3.2\xc2\xb0Kelvin, an ideal computer running at 3.2\xc2\xb0K would consume 4.4\xc3\x9710-16 ergs every time it set or cleared a bit. To run a computer any colder than the cosmic background radiation would require extra energy to run a heat pump.\n\nNow, the annual energy output of our sun is about 1.21\xc3\x971041 ergs. This is enough to power about 2.7\xc3\x971056 single bit changes on our ideal computer; enough state changes to put a 187-bit counter through all its values. If we built a Dyson sphere around the sun and captured all its energy for 32 years, without any loss, we could power a computer to count up to 2192. Of course, it wouldn\'t have the energy left over to perform any useful calculations with this counter.\n\nBut that\'s just one star, and a measly one at that. A typical supernova releases something like 1051 ergs. (About a hundred times as much energy would be released in the form of neutrinos, but let them go for now.) If all of this energy could be channeled into a single orgy of computation, a 219-bit counter could be cycled through all of its states.\n\nThese numbers have nothing to do with the technology of the devices; they are the maximums that thermodynamics will allow. And they strongly imply that brute-force attacks against 256-bit keys will be infeasible until computers are built from something other than matter and occupy something other than space.\n\n ...Even a mythical quantum computer won\'t be able to brute-force that large a keyspace.\n\n': 1, 'I only skimmed through the article, but this quote seems to point to the complete opposite of the topic title.\n\n>According to our current understanding, **they would provide dramatic speedups for a few specific problems\xe2\x80\x94such as breaking the cryptographic codes that are widely used for monetary transactions on the Internet.** For other problems, however\xe2\x80\x94such as playing chess, scheduling airline flights and proving theorems\xe2\x80\x94evidence now strongly suggests that quantum computers would suffer from many of the same algorithmic limitations as today\xe2\x80\x99s classical computers.': 6, "No, it's not.\n\nQuantum computing is already doing extremely important calculations.

(In mathematicall language, they are the equivalence classes of the reflexive,symmetric, and transitive closure of the "appear together" relation; or the connected components of the "appear together" graph.)\n\nSome of those "wallets" can be identified with famous entities by addresses that were published somewhere, or by experiment (send a few satoshis to Bitstamp, and wait for that receiving address get merged into some big wallet).\n\nThe algorithm can fail in two ways.  If BitPay (for example) has some receiving addresses that were never merged with the others, those addresses will appear as an separate wallet with a nondescript numeric "name".  (For that reason, in fact, each time the database is rebuilt some wallets may gain "new" transactions that happened arbitrarily far in the past.) \n\nThe other possible failure is that one *can* issue a transaction where the inputs belong to two different people, each signing his part of the transaction.  The CoinJoin service does that all the time.  For that reason, most of the addresses that were used with CoinJoin ended up in one humongous wallet, which Ale\xc5\xa1 called "MtGOXandOthers" before he knew what it actually was.': 2}, ('BitcoinTalk hidden pages', 8): {'thanks bro was actually looking for the password reset log page :)': 2}, ('Searching for German-speaking Bitcoin users for a 10 minute interview. 5\xe2\x82\xac in BTC reward', 28): {'how do you want us to interview ? email-chat-video ?\n\nif you still searching more people send me a pm- bin dabei  :)': 1, 'Hi Vnnkl,\n\ndanke!

When is the last time a new nation was formed without a revolution?"\n\nTo create a decentralised \'state\', what we need to do is come up with a law protocol that everyone can run in their heads, and use it as a basis for interacting with each other. So, it needs to be thorough enough to support a functioning society, but simple enough that not only highly specialised lawyers can comprehend it: it needs to be concise. A way we might do this, is by thinking about what kinds of interactions are beneficial in society, and what kinds of actions are harmful, and then trying to derive a universal principle or set of principles which distinguish these good and bad actions from each other on a fundamental level.\n\nOnce we have this protocol running on enough human brains, to determine what is legal and what is illegal according to the protocol, we can start to build up infrastructure around it. The more people use this protocol and the longer it\'s around, the better the infrastructure will get; but it would all be built around this underlying protocol.\n\nAn example principle is \'The Non Aggression Principle\'. This principle used to only work as a complete protocol for human interactions when combined with an additional protocol for property rights (in a \'Human Interaction Protocol Suite\'), as the original \'NAP\' was defined as \'not initiating force against other people\'. Therefore it was quite complex and not easy enough for the average person to run without getting fatal errors, and different client versions would not work together, e.g. when the protocol suite featured different property rights protocols. So, whilst this was a good principle for direct interpersonal interactions, when considered alone it fell apart when determining how humans should interact with non-human resources: as if I take your car, I didn\'t actually initiate force against you, though this would in most cases be problematic. The principle is being actively developed however, and NAP v 1.0 has recently been released as a stand-alone protocol, with the following algorithm: "Non aggression is, not bringing rivalrous resources (including human bodies) into physical conflict." You need to install the relevant libraries for the English language in your brain in order to process the commands, before you will be able to run this algorithm properly; if you don\'t have the right libraries installed already. You can download the libraries from Wikipedia, e.g. the \'rivalry\' library which is found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivalry_%28economics%29\n\nThis algorithm is now capable of supporting decentralised government; the more people adopt it, the more impact it will have.': 9, 'Why the downvoting this is real': 2, ':/ That\'s not what the word "theory" means.\n\nSorry, will stop feeding the trolls.': 3, "You're assuming that a nation would actually *need* to secure their currency with a network of miners managing a distributed ledger.

It seems you skipped over some of my points in my last post regarding incentives. Take taxation for example, whilst some people pay it voluntarily, perhaps most people don't want to pay taxes, but most people do want everyone else to pay taxes, so they support taxation even though they don't want to pay it themselves. And because most people support taxation, it is effectively enforced, and so even the people -- which is likely most people -- who would rather not pay taxes, end up paying them anyway because of the incentive created by the threats associated with not paying.

Then on top of that layer, you have free-market arbitrators & investigators to resolve disputes and minimise conflicts over resources, basically to add the human element to the property-rights registration software, where the software falls short. Then on top of that, you have enforcement, to protect people's rights through force if it comes to that -- if all other measures have failed; enforcement is expensive, unpleasant, and can have blow-back ramifications, so all efforts should be made to minimise the need for it. You also have the insurance companies, who insure people against damages resulting from violations of the NAP; they work with the arbiters, enforcement, and also within communities to help prevent conflicts from arising in the first place (e.g. offering courses on how to get on well with other people, how to negotiate win-win outcomes, how to use the property-rights software properly, etc..), in order to minimise the amount they have to pay out on claims, increase good-will/reputation, and minimise their fees so they can win out against the competition for subscribers.": 2, "If a protocol-running person interacted with a non-protocol running person, then either the nodes would make calculations, and one would decide that it could not win, and would temporarily follow the dominant protocol in order to get along smoothly, or there would be conflict.

The story did not read did like a typical coinfire story - pretty well thought out, step-by-step break down of how they know what they know.  This time, we got vacuous crap.  You might recall that Coinfire\'s accounts have been hacked recently following their reports about GAW\'s legal troubles (ahem...motive).  Fake/planted story?  But what about Syscoin\'s blog and Ferd\'s "confirmation" of this story?  Those folks lack credibility - they believed Moolah the first time or possibly worked w/ Moolah to invent a fake lawsuit to exit the chaos when Moo started to collapse. They\'re also adverse parties to one another in the moo bankruptcy and civil matter, yet supposedly have the same attorney (ahem, holy conflict of interest). They might even need some cash right now (more motive, see the first motive, see Dan\'s twitter post selling off his Beamer).  Backs can be scratched. Alternatively, they\'d probably like questions about their moo involvement to stop.  This story is convenient.  Has any crypto news outfit (if there is one) reported on the fact that the High Court has already ordered (December 23rd) a dissolution order in Moo\'s Bankruptcy case and the implications thereof?  How about this: it sounds pretty far fetched that Ferd or Syscoin would be under confidentially orders (they said an agreement, but they probably wanted to say "gag order" unless they didn\'t know to say that and weren\'t actually under one) to not speak of Kennedy\'s arrest - criminal proceedings are separate and a matter of public record absent sex crimes or crimes against children.

I didn't think about this when I wrote about using IPv6 multicast. IPv6 multicast is trusting centralized authorities by design and we cannot have such authorities filter transactions. Therefore, all transactions have to go through and the downside to this is that we're allowing spam.\n\n> Is IPv6 multicast tested in the real world do you know?\n\nI quickly looked through your comment history and you seem to have dug way deeper into IPv6 than I have :-) I have taken the basic courses. As far as I know, IPv6 multicast is not in wide use anywhere. But because of the hierarchical design of the IPv6 address space it should be easy to make it work.
