The beauty of it being divisible is that we would simply move the decimal place over if necessary because the value is derived from a fraction of 1 bitcoin being 1/21,000,000 of the total in existence. Therefore, as long as that fraction stays the same and is reflected throughout the system (amount in individual\'s wallets, mining rewards, etc.?) then it will still retain its scarceness. 1/21,000,000=10/210,000,000=100/2,100,000,000 etc. At this point this would only confuse an outsider and even further down the road I think this idea would only come into play if it seemed absolutely necessary but it does seem to answer any "problems" regarding how unecessary zeros are used when describing a bitcoins value (ex. if 0.0000001 btc= $1 or had similar buying power all of those zeros may become seen as unecessary). I think this is what you\'re asking?': 2, 'remember one thing:  \nfiat currency = inflationary= lose value in time  \nbitcoin currency = deflationary = earn value in time': 1, 'There is debate as to what to do once we reach the cap and start the deflation of supply. Most people want higher divisibility (or infinite divisibility) to counter lost coins. I used to think infinite divisibility is ok. Now I think it\'s more of a patch-on workaround rather than a full solution. A proper economic solution would be to reintroduce the lost supply of coins such that the economy is always at 21m. Someone linked me this which is a pretty good read of the two arguments for and against (IRC chat log):\n\nhttp://bitcoinstats.com/irc/bitcoin-dev/logs/2012/10/05#l1349440627\n\nIf we just continue our "infinite divisibility" dream of adding new decimal places when we need it, there will be a point where we could run the economy with just 1m btc/7b users, and can be reduced to even 1 btc/7b users. Imagine the economic power of owning 50 btc by being lucky enough to find 1 lost private key. It\'s insane. You\'ll have enough money to buy the planet 50 times over. By continually circulating the 21 million btc we will have a more stable economy (21m btc/7b between generations) so the economy won\'t actually reach those lows.\n\nOne argument against it is it is basically theft. However if you don\'t want your coin redistributed just keep transferring it back to your own addresses and you\'ll get to keep your coin till your next address. If the expiry date is long enough (100 years) I don\'t see a problem - your human self would probably expire well before your coins do.\n\nAnother argument for it is cryptography will eventually lose power to growing computing power, making it slightly easier to find that lucky lost private key. We theorise today\'s cryptography can last us a hundred years, but can it last us a thousand? Then coin reintroduction would make sense - people will start moving their coins to new, more secure addresses, and the lost & dead will leave the old ones behind. If we don\'t distribute the lost coins to miners, someone else will take it anyway. We won\'t be absolutely clear how that someone will use it, whereas we know pretty well how a miner will use it, & we can define how much a miner is allowed to take vs the rogue who can take all of it.': 2, "I get it, you bought in and want others to follow to make you rich.

Something most bitcoin enthusiasts are excited about.\n\nUnlike fiat currency, where trillions are created out of thin air at will by bankers who devalue everyone\'s money and ultimately fuel a bubble 100% guaranteed to collapse in the future.\n\nIf I give you a $100 I can guarantee that in ten years it will be worth less. 100% guaranteed by design.\n\nSo long as bitcoin survives and grows with adoption you can be pretty sure it will increase in value.  \n\nHaving a predictable money supply ruled by math, rather than bankers, is the preference most of us are choosing.': 14, 'No, you don\'t get it.

We\xe2\x80\x99re not going to comment on specifics of the case, but the account was in review because of the discrepancies, excessive failed login attempts and more.\nThe explanation was offered to the customer and they have agreed that the suspicion we had were reasonable. We\xe2\x80\x99re working with them to understand the  situation and resolve it of course.\n\n2) The verification process. \nWe\xe2\x80\x99re an exchange and we need to meet our AML and KYC obligations. KYC is not and cannot be done in matter of minutes or hours. If you live in country A, provide identity from  country B, and deposit money from country C - it is a huge red flag. That to us is high risk and we will need to take our time to throughly review their documentations and other information provided. \nTo add to that, we cannot accept expired identity documentations either. The documents have to be valid and has to be current, including your utility bills. \nCompliance is a very important step and we ask our users not to get impatient. \n\n3) Even if you are at Level 2 and the system flags you for whatever reason, we need to make sure we attend to that. We cannot fast track certain compliance requirements at all. Bank frauds, BPAY frauds, and Bitcoin frauds are way too common for us, or any exchange to ignore. The risk is bigger than the reward. We\xe2\x80\x99re not in this business for fraudulent people to move money anonymously. We require full disclosure from our users. \n\n4) Room for improvement - Can we do better? Of course!

We appreciate your feedback.\nWe will make it our mission to expedite what we can to make sure there are no delays.\n\nThere is no excuse for us to delay legitimate withdrawals and for the legitimate delays, please accept our apologies. \nAt the same time, we have to make sure that the fraudulent ones don\xe2\x80\x99t get away with free Bitcoin.\nIts bad for us, its bad for the victim, and ultimately, its bad for Bitcoin.\n\nIf your account is experiencing excessive delays - I ask you to email compliance@igot.com to ask why. \nIf your account is in review and is being investigated, we will not be able to give you all details upfront (so we don\xe2\x80\x99t tip off the fraudulent guys), but will provide a timeframe.\n\nFor any other inquiries, please open a Support Ticket, or email hello@igot.com.\n\nOnce again, please accept my sincere apologies for delays on legitimate withdrawals.
