The economists seem sure that it would be horrible to have a deflating currency because if would cause savings and prevent consumption. Let me point out a couple things about this. First we have real world examples that contradict this expectation. There is new computer hardware coming out all the time that is better and cheaper than stuff that was around just a while before. There has been no reluctance to buy better computers just because we know they will be better and cheaper later. Second, they insist that you need to inject money into the system to accommodate growth. The current system creates new currency through fractional reserve banking to expand the money supply. This money is basically free to the banks and gives them enormous wealth and power. I understand why they would argue that to be the best of all possible worlds. A deflationary system like bitcoin has to expand to meet growth too but it doesn't do it by increasing the number of coins but rather the value of the coins. This means that the benefit is not given to an elite few but is shared by all who hold the coins. We all get a little raise for growing the economy. It is much more democratic than the old system. Since we can keep moving the decimal of value we can have infinite growth of the value while keeping the nominal number of coins unchanged. It's a revolution and they current monopoly holders are going to try to convince people that it won't work. Let's prove them wrong.

In BOINC, all the calculations are run by two different computers to verify that the computer did the calculation correctly (they are given credit for this, which I was thinking could be kind of like the currency), but that is not on par with Bitcoin's verification in the block chain. I haven't really thought of a way to make this secure enough for a currency without making it so inefficient there's no point.

If you want computation from a datacenter you have to buy it. My idea is that you could just run your own computer then have access to using other people's later. This is not the same as a datacenter.

It has a decentralized component in that anyone can "fork" the software and run their own version.  \n\nFor Bitcoin if you run your own version that is incompatible with the main network then you can run it just fine but the coins won\'t work if you try to interface with regular Bitcoin users.

However, it\'s not an impossible problem to deal with. I don\'t think the people are lying about the problems moving amazon credit around. What is much more implausible is that Purse.io can survive "mainly on credit card fraud." In your case, no one profited, right? If they weren\'t getting tons of legitimate business, surely they\'d be gone by now?': 1, "People don't like it is because it promotes the use of stolen credit cards.": 1, "I mean the fraud is Amazon's problem because the way purse.io is set up, the credit card buyer of BTC's only payment interaction is directly with Amazon.  It's completely up to Amazon to detect if the purchase is valid before they ship anything, and to deal with it afterwards if they don't catch it in time.  For all Amazon may know, purse.io and the whole BTC transaction might not exist.  Except that maybe Amazon will notice some day the increasingly fraudulent activity coming from their wishlist feature.\n\nAnd yes, I unfortunately think this kind of credit card-for-bitcoin scheme is doomed for failure.  There is something fundamentally different about offering a perfectly fenceable and unrecoverable asset for sale by credit card.  You can't compare it directly to dealing with physical goods, where a small percentage of fraud is sometimes acceptable.  Of course you usually can't order large quantities of gold online with a credit card either.\n\nWith stolen credit cards available online by the thousands, it's just too easy for the scammers to ruin the system.  Even if only one in a thousand orders gets thru Amazon's fraud detection, once the bad guys have the BTC, nobody's getting them back, and they probably won't get caught.": 1, '"Promotes?" :P\n\nI was always concerned about this potential problem but purse.io has apparently done a pretty good job dealing with it.\n\nI couldn\'t believe people would take a 20% hit just to buy bitcoin, until I heard some people on a podcast (sorry can\'t remember if it was LTB or something else) about what\'s really going on. There are a LOT of people out there paid in Amazon credit that they can\'t use. For example, if you\'re an affiliate advertising something that\'s bought by someone in the UK, you can\'t spend that credit earned anywhere except Amazon UK, and if you don\'t have a UK bank account, it might cost too much to make it worth withdrawing. However, if you can convert it to Bitcoin you have many ways to spend it - *including* buying amazon credit with Gyft that you could actually use.\n\nIf any of this is incorrect info, please correct me - I have never been paid in Amazon credit, but to my best recollection, this is how it was explained by people who are.': 3, "If you are a seller of legit Amazon credits with a good reputation/track record, you'll have people lined up on bitcointalk.org or #bitcoin-otc IRC to buy at 10-15% discount, and you'll make occasional deals for 0-10% discounts.\n\nI do think it's an impossible problem to deal with.  Any time you offer to trade an easily stolen and cancelable payment method with an untraceable, uncancelable one, you'll have this problem.\n\nI applaud purse.io (and Amazon) for coming up with their clever system and I very much wish it could work and I could use it, but I don't think it can.  There's just too many cleverer bad guys out there.\n\nThe thing is, purse.io may survive indefinitely with their clever system, because thanks to Amazon's clever order API and wishlist system, the fraud problem turns into Amazon's problem.\n\nI only wasted my time and a few bits (because purse.io doesn't refund you every BTC you deposit) but I'd be worried about trying this more than once.  Amazon has your address and they know it's your wishlist people are shipping you stuff from with stolen credit cards.  I'm sure it happens occasionally even without purse.io, but given the stolen cc#->BTC incentive, you're basically inviting the bad guys of the world to ship hot goods to your residence.\n\nTerrible concept, avoid.\n": 1, "Sounds like you didn't even read what I said - they're NOT selling gift cards, and if it was credit card fraud these guys would be out of business by now and we would have seen hundreds of complaints.

You can liquidate legit Amazon credits elsewhere for maybe 8-15% discount.\n\nAt the urging of Roger Ver and others who love this site, I tried it out and didn't like it.  Waited 3 days for my first order to be filled.  Then 4 days after purse.io tells me my order has shipped, they say Amazon has cancelled it.  Why?  Credit card fraud of course.": 1, 'No one who hasn\'t already used Bitcoin-otc is going to go there to sell a few dollars of Amazon credit. It\'s a lot of hassle for the target audience I heard described, whereas Purse.io has made it easy.\n\nCredit card fraud is a significant problem with significant costs, but come on, impossible? People pay the costs and manage to do business with credit cards every day. In this situation, one way they could deal with it would be extending trust only to sellers with a solid history. They could be (and must be) holding Bitcoin payments for untrusted accounts long enough to make sure there was no fraud. In your case Amazon didn\'t even ship. The fraud was detected quickly. The scammer got nothing.\n\nI definitely don\'t like the idea of someone shipping stuff to my house with a stolen credit card, either. Once it\'s happened I wouldn\'t expect you to try again. That being said, if someone has bought off your wishlist, Amazon can\'t hold you responsible. Otherwise, anyone pissed at you could ruin your life by shipping things you didn\'t order to your house.

There are 2,647,060.58 currently. Some of those will be burned with the issuance of new assets, payment of dividends, and execution of these Ethereum scripts.\n> How is XCP not just another altcoin?\n\nXCP was created so that the Counterparty system would have a default token-of-value that could be escrowed natively. This is what enables two-step trustless trading with any significant amount of liquidity, binary bets, and contracts-for-difference. XCP is also the currency used to call back assets (you can create assets with the option to call them back after a certain date and at a certain minimum price in XCP).\n\nCalling XCP "just another altcoin" really depends on how broad your definition is of that phrase. XCP is unique in that it is not mined and absent a change to the Bitcoin protocol, is the only way the escrow-requiring features mentioned above could work.\n> What happens if counterparty decides at one point to switch their database from the bitcoin blockchain to another one?\n\nThe choice of a transport-layer blockchain has everything to do with security. If Counterparty were to switch to another chain, that would likely mean that Bitcoin were no longer the most secure chain. As unlikely as that seems, it wouldn\'t affect native Counterparty operations much except transactions may confirm in a different amount of time and any Ethereum-based operations with the underlying currency (BTC vs. the proposed chain) would need some special attention.': 5, "Counterparty is basically a separate blockchain with separate coins that is all encoded into the Bitcoin blockchain (therefore not strictly a classic altcoin). The advantage of doing this is that the XCP blockchain inherits all the security of Bitcoin's blockchain without having to invest anything in infrastructure (other than paying bitcoin fees, for the encoding). The disadvantage is that they are dependent on the Bitcoin blockchain (such as, 10 minute block time, etc.)\n\nSince XCP has no mining, the coins cannot be generated by mining. So instead there was proof-of-burn, where anyone who could prove they burnt bitcoins during the specific period automagically starts off with XCP coins.
