I\'m not sure exactly sure what is the motivation behind your suggestion to make it the default to store 1 year and prune earlier. Maybe if you explain the reasoning behind doing that rather than for example pruning everything, then I could comment better on your suggestion.\n\nI am not an expert in how this works, but my understanding about pruning is that it works as follows:\n\n1. Download all block headers and fit them together into the chain\n\n2. Download and validate blocks. You start with the genesis block and work forward. You build the UTXO database. As outputs are validly spent, then can be deleted from your computer\n\nThe normal pruning approach thus begins at the genesis block and works forward, validating blocks and updating the UTXO database along the way.\n\nThe approach I am advocating does not begin with the genesis block and work forward -- rather it begins with the most recent block and works backward. Rather than build your own UTXO database, you would request a copy from a peer. You would hash it and compare the hash to a hash the miner\'s added to the recent block. After verifying that you have the "official" UTXO database, you would validate blocks in reverse order. The advantage to doing it this way is that it is more important to validate recent blocks than it is to validate old blocks -- so we should prioritize the validation of recent blocks. Ideally, if your node ran for long enough, you would get all the way back to the genesis block, but as a practical matter if you validate all blocks in the previous year it is plenty good enough, because there is no chance that a 1 year reorg will ever be permitted to happen.': 1, 'Get it, thanks.': 1, 'You simply get pruned blocks older than 1 year (and just store them (and believe them to be correct)) and you prune yourself the blocks younger than 1 year. ': 1, "Last I checked, we don't even have 1 year worth of *total work* with current mining technology. That is to say, if all the miners wanted to 51% attack the blockchain back to the start, it would take them less than a year to do it. And this is the metric you'd want to use for such a rule (not raw time), so it wouldn't have any effect right now.\n\nPruning is another matter: you aren't trusting anything, just discarding old data you no longer need. Pruning nodes can prune a lot more than all-but-the-last-year, but they can't bootstrap someone new.\n\nPruning, however, only works because the data has already been processed before being discarded. You still need to download the data to process it, and Bitcoin today can't skip that unless you trust *everything* (including the future).": 2, '> So NO-ONE in the world needs to store full (unpruned) blocks older than 1 year\n\nPruning requires all of the blocks.
