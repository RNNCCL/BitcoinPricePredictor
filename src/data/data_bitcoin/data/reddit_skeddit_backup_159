Now miners no longer have a hard limit on the size of the block they need to engineer their networks to be able to handle in a timely fashion. Instead, they have to guess what blocksize 51% of the network might be willing to create, and they have to engineer their networks accordingly, and they also have to choose a blocksize limit that they think will put them on the majority side lest they lose out on orphan races.

My opinion is 1 to 2 months. \n\n> But do they prefer an effective increase sooner or a hard fork sooner?\n\nI do not currently have data on that. My impression from the discussion at the conference was that they thought that a hard fork sooner was preferable, but that's just an impression. I have not thoroughly discussed timelines or SegWit with miners yet. To-do list item.\n\n> Because the Core team also wants an effective increase sooner than that, they're just worried about the risks of a hard fork.\n\nYes, that seems to be an attitude that is prevalent among Core (esp. Blockstream) developers and is not shared by the miners or most of the users.  Core Devs would get most of the blame in the event of a disaster, but they do not get a proportionate amount of reward in the event of a success, so I think they are suffering from a conservative bias compared to what would be optimal for Bitcoin as a whole. I think that Blockstream is serving as an echo chamber for anxiety and fear, and I think that this is a problem for all Bitcoin users.": 9, "> The con is that you no longer have signature data in the blockchain.\n\nThat is not correct. The signature data is still part of the blockchain, still needed to verify transactions as valid. What SegWit does is to separate both parts (transaction data, signature) on the wire, so they can be sent and received independently.\n\nIt really doesn't affect security at all, it would be really stupid of clients to accept un-signed transaction data as valid. It does help however if they want to ditch the signature data for some older blocks once they have verified the latest transactions... but really, clients could do that right now, it's just that they would not be able to collaborate in the p2p network with any blocks they locally stripped signatures from.": 1, 'nice job.

Am I understanding it correctly? ': 0, "Why not a SegWit soft fork instead of a blocksize increase hard fork? Here are my opinions. \n\n1. SegWit is a lot more complicated than a simple blocksize increase, and has been under discussion and investigation for a much shorter period of time. I am not comfortable with it being deployed on a time scale that I think a capacity increase should be deployed on. \n\n2. SegWit would require *all* bitcoin software (including SPV wallets) to be partially rewritten in order to have the same level of security they currently have, whereas a blocksize increase only requires full nodes to be updated (and with pretty minor changes).\n\n3. SegWit increases the capacity for typical transaction loads (mostly P2PKH) to a maximum effective size of 1.75 MB. SegWit increases the capacity for blocks full of specially crafted transactions or multisig transactions to 4 MB. This means that it eats up a lot of our safety headroom (e.g. for adversarial conditions) while only providing a very modest increase in typical capacity. This seems like it might actually be intentional, as it makes the types of transactions that will be needed for Blockstream products like sidechains and Lightning relatively cheaper, and will not benefit on-chain transactions much. The reduction in headroom will also make any subsequent blocksize increases harder to gain political support for, which also may be intentional. This concern can be addressed by limiting the total size of SegWit block+witness to around 2 MB.\n\n4. SegWit makes more technical sense as a hard fork. As a soft fork, it would be deployed by putting the merkle root of the witness data tree into the coinbase message or into an OP_RETURN transaction somewhere. The coinbase message field is already quite cramped with block height, extranonce1 and extranonce2, merged mining information, blocksize vote information, and other miner/pool-specific data, and I believe that the remaining space should be reserved for miner use, not for developer use. An OP_RETURN transaction sounds technically preferable, but still pretty crufty and nasty. Both options would have the result that all witness proofs would require including the merkle path to the transaction in question plus the transaction in question, and would increase the size of such proofs by about 50%. Putting the witness data in a sibling tree to the transaction data makes way more technical sense, makes the whole system easier to code for in all wallet and Bitcoin software that will ever be written, and reduces the size and complexity of verifying the witness proofs. However, doing so would require a hard fork, which is what the Core developers are trying so desperately to avoid.\n\n5. SegWit makes more security sense as a hard fork. With SegWit, all Bitcoin wallets would no longer be able to accurately verify new transactions, and all Bitcoin software would need to be updated to be able to verify the new transaction+witness data format. With a soft fork, old wallets will see all new transactions as being valid regardless of whether they are actually valid or not. Pieter Wuille (sipa) makes the case that this will not result in any actual dangers to most users because miners will be selfishly honest and will only create blocks that are valid under the new rules. With a hard fork, old nodes would still fully validate transactions according to the rules that they were written for, and would not see new transactions or would mark them as invalid. They would remain on a separate and fully validating blockchain that lacked economic and had nearly zero mining. I think it is preferable to indicate the consensus rules have changed by moving mining and economic activity off of the old rules rather than to write the new rules in such a way that old nodes are relying on their trust in miners instead of verifying the rules themselves. I think that with a soft fork, nodes and software will not get upgraded as fast because the old code will still be dangerously mostly compatible, whereas with a hard fork, people will notice that they're not getting new blocks and upgrade because that's the only way they can maintain functionality.": 33, "In short it's BIP 101 with it's exponential function and very big block to 8 GB...": 2, "I'm a bot, *bleep*, *bloop*.

They reduce network\'s average block size, and can be utilized to mine in low bandwidth areas.  At the same time, a block sequence of sizes 3N,0,0 is arguably better for users than N,N,N because more transactions are deeper sooner.\n\nYou end up with a network throughput (transaction commitment capacity) equation that looks like this:\n\n Th = Q/ (Q/z) + T \n\nWhere Q is the average block size, T is the 10 minute expected block discovery time and z is the "propagation impedence" (or how many kB/s of transactions on average the network can send and validate)\n\nMy analysis of a year+ worth of single transaction blocks indicate that the bitcoin network is limited to 60 kB/s.\n\nSee http://www.bitcoinunlimited.info/1txn#throughput\n\n\nAdditionally, the Keynesian beauty contest analogy is flawed because:\n\n1. miners can generate blocks conservatively but accept blocks liberally -- there no real metaphor for this, maybe its like saying "I vote for X, but I benefit if any of the candidates win" \n\n2. miners can put the max size they will accept in the coinbase transaction.

It's clear that SegWit has complete consensus and we should minimize technical debt and do a SegWit hard fork, which is low risk with good co-ordination. I think the benefit/costs are worth it.\n\nUnfortunately, it does seem that doing it with a soft fork is a partly political decision to distinguish it from XT / hard forks, and not a purely technical decision.\n\nContradictory to some people's claims, bitcoin has already hard forked. A 0.3.2 node will not sync and I believe has a slightly different conflicting blocks at its tail (some miners have tried to mine with it much later on). But that's OK, because *everyone* upgraded.\n\nThere is also broader consensus that even with Lightning and SegWit, we need to increase the block size later on and it is safe to do so. This is obvious, given that network bandwidth and speeds do increase over time. This will require a hard fork. Bitcoin **will** need to hard fork and increase the block size at some point (assuming bitcoin doesn't die); even Rusty agrees. Lightning can do a lot, but it still requires sufficiently cheap on-chain settlement for security, and sufficiently cheap on-chain settlement requires sufficient capacity.\n\nIf we can agree on 2/4/8 (rescaled for SegWit conservatively, so 1.25MB / 2.5 MB / 5 MB nominal block size) as suggested on the mailing list roadmap and do that with the SegWit hard fork, then I see that as the most optimal plausible path.\n\nI doubt that'll happen tho.

It implies that we are more decentralized if 90% of the nodes are in agreement about a 'valid' blockchain, but by definition if they all agreed on a different definition of 'valid' (a given  set of rules) then the ability of the minority to opt-out is negligible, which to me sounds more centralized.\n\nWe have to treat the concepts separately, a measure of decentralized-ness has nothing to do with the notion of valid-ness of a particular blockchain.\n\nThe notion of decentralization speaks to the propensity of a large population in a network to act 'as one' (ie consistently act together or in tandem).  The way you are describing decentralization (with the 9000 nodes vs 5m nodes example) sounds more like you mean network resiliency or node failure redundancy, which protects against random uniformly distributed failures.\n\nUltimately the best way to measure decentralization is in dollar value needed to co-opt 50% of the network.

Once that is in place, it would be up to the other sidechains whether they wish to accept that altchain\'s assets being moved in or not in addition to (or instead of) bitcoins.

Lets pretend that there are a total of 25,000 litecoins in existence.  if the sidechain was funded with 250 bitcoins, then each sidechain litecoin would be worth .01 bitcoins.  Litecoins existing value can\'t be "ported" into a sidechain without using an equivalent value of bitcoins to fund the chain.  Also, how would mining work?

So the network has about 112 * NUMBER_OF_LISTENING_FULL_NODES connection slots. Each online full node uses 8 slots and each online lightweight node uses a smaller number (IIRC 4 is typical).

Then set the maxconnections=... setting to a few hundred (note that increasing this significantly increases bandwidth, CPU, disk, and memory requirements -- you may need to experiment to find the right value).

The error of the estimate is ~10% (I can run more extensive simulations for a more accurate figure). To prevent the same lucky period from being double-counted, I treated as separate only occasions that are at least 100 blocks apart (because of the rarity of the event, there shouldn\'t be significant false negatives).\n\n This is all assuming, of course, fixed hashrate and an ideal Poisson Process with rate of 1 per 10 minutes.\n\n/u/luke-jr\n\nETA (after reading some comments): I was referred to the code that is responsible for triggering the alarm, and I can see where Gavin\'s code is going wrong. There are two issues, a minor one and a major one.\n\nThe minor issue is that it uses the pdf rather than cdf - the value calculated is the chance of exactly 48 blocks, rather than at least 48 blocks which is more relevant.\n\nThe major issue is that the code assumes we subdivide time to neat, disjoint spans of 4 hours, and figures out how long it would take to get a span with 48 blocks. But in reality there are no disjoint spans, at any point in time the alarm system can look at the past 4 hours and see if there are 48 blocks. So if we take a period of 50 years and subdivide it, there will be on average 1 neat span with 48 blocks. But there will be ~10 more 4-hour spans which cross the borders of our subdivision and have 48 blocks.\n\nAt another extreme, we could say that every block gives us another opportunity to look at the past 4 hours. This would give us an average of one event per 2 years (50/24). But that\'s not right either because the events are correlated, so we\'d be counting the same lucky streak multiple times.\n\nThe correct value is somewhere in between, and currently I don\'t know how to calculate it analytically. I can simulate it, and as mentioned the result is about once every 4 years.\n\nI should clarify one more thing: The code tries (in an incorrect way, but still) to calculate how rare would be such a lucky streak - under the assumption that hashrate is constant.

That\'s what the alarm is trying to do - we are encountering something which was unlikely based on just random variation, so there may be another factor (such as a massive hashrate increase) which we should watch out for.\n\nETA2: Another point to consider - since the alarm is triggered by the number of blocks, which is discrete, we can never reach a threshold which will give a rarity of exactly 50 years. One threshold will give significantly more than 50 years, the next will give significantly less.\n\nSo even if the code is fixed, we shouldn\'t take the "50 years" constant in it at face value.\n\nIf the code is changed so that instead of looking at number of blocks in the past 4 hours, we look at the amount of time of the last X blocks, the parameter is continuous so we can choose a threshold that will give exactly 50 years.': 77}, ('Has anyone tried https://vps.bitnodes.io', 0): {'https://vps.bitnodes.io': 1, "There's no returns, it's a vps": 3}, ('Crypto-Counseling: Smart Contracts in Psychotherapy (Part 2: Practical Application in the Sharing Economy)', 0): {}, ('What is a "full node"?', 27): {"A full node is a mining node...\xf0\x9f\x99\x88\n\nEdit : \n\n> Based on the original and correct definition, there are around 20 mining-nodes on the Bitcoin network.

Today\'s computers have a clock frequency a thousand times higher than the first personal computers in the early 1980\'s. The amount of RAM memory on a computer has increased by a factor ten thousand, and the hard disk capacity has increased more than a hundred thousand times. We have become so used to this continued growth that we almost consider it a law of nature, which we are calling Moore\'s law.

We are now approaching **the physical limit** where computing speed is limited by the size of an atom and the speed of light.\n\nYou want to bet Bitcoin\'s future on this?\n\nI would bet the house on the dev team **a hundred times over** before I even considered doing something so rash.\n\n> Intel\'s iconic Tick-Tock clock has begun to skip a beat now and then. Every Tick is a shrinking of the transistor size, and every Tock is an improvement of the microarchitecture. The current processor generation called Skylake is a Tock with a 14 nanometer process. The next in sequence would logically be a Tick with a 10 nanometer process, but Intel is now putting "refresh cycles" after the tocks. The next processor, announced for 2016, will be a refresh of the Skylake, still with a 14 nanometer process [2]. This slowdown of the Tick-Tock clock is a physical necessity, because we are approching the limit where a transistor is only a few atoms wide (a silicon atom is 0.2 nanometers).\n\nRight?

This is, actually, a valid argument to make. However, it has nothing to do with Satoshi the person.

As a result, things like increasing the number of bitcoin\'s ever produced will need to overcome this argument. That being said, in the case of blocksize, it\'s a non-starter as an argument. What ended up defining the social contract was the bitcoin wiki page on scalability, not anything that Satoshi said.

Farther suppose that the channel was being used between parties for micropayment purposes (far less than $20 transactions). Since it costs as much or more to settle to the Blockchain as may be in the channel to begin with, nobody will settle to the chain. Thus, the channel is insecure, no?\n\nIsn\'t the security of the channel (and LN in general) contingent upon the fact that either counterparty can close the channel and settle to the Blockchain?  \n\nSo, it seems that higher fees on the Blockchain may NOT end up driving more transactions to LN. Instead Ever higher Blockchain fees make larger and larger transactions on LN less and less secure (since its increasingly economically unfeasible to settle them to Blockchain), and therefore such transactions are less likely to happen.  No?\n\nIn short, I don\'t understand how competition between LN and "on chain" transactions is supposed to create the "balancing" effect you mention. Rather, higher "on chain" fees render more and more LN transactions insecure and therefore not feasible. \n\nWhat am I missing?': 0, "Think you're missing the point, it doesn't matter what kind of hardware or infrastructure is required to run a Lightning hub.

": 1, "There'll be a balance with LN and bitcoin transaction fees there.\n\nIf the bitcoin fees are too low, it likely won't make sense to keep large LN channels open as that also means there's very little to be gained from routing fees. You do need a secure computer online to route LN payments through your channels, even if keeping the channels open doesn't require an online computer all the time.\n\nWhen bitcoin fees are high, there's a large incentive to optimize your channels and make sure they're open and active (that is routing payments) so that you can profit from offering people cheaper payments than Bitcoin itself. This means more and more people will pay through LN and transaction pressure on bitcoin blocks will drop, causing the fee to drop too.\n\nBetween these two, there'll be a point of balance that'll be the actual fee level in bitcoin. This is the natural market balance that will form.\n\nHowever, aside from this natural balance, the mining power does have a rather direct effect on the value of Bitcoin. What I mean is that if mining power drops enough, that will start dropping the price of Bitcoin. This means that there will be incentive for holders of bitcoin to cooperate and make sure there exists sufficient mining to keep the price stable. Exactly what form this will take is unclear, but the incentive is there. Hell, I'll organize it to happen myself if no-one else does it and it seems necessary.\n\nAs for relay nodes and risk. Well, this is the part that'll be decentralized to a large degree.

This network is self-healing in this respect.\n\na prompt commit does matter in some cases and won't matter in others. Basically, if you make money through taking a cut for routing payments, you'll want prompt commits when you're closing less profitable channels and opening more profitable ones. If you're not routing for profit, you might not care for a prompt commit. However, the other party in the channel might want it. It's not just your money tied up in a channel, most of the time.\n\nThe legal question is the trickiest one to answer.

But let's start with your example.\n\nIf bitcoin transaction cost was around $20 per transaction, that'd mean that no-one would open a channel with less than $20 of total value in it because there'd be no point. I suspect it'd be quite rare to see channels without at least $200 of value in them.\n\nHowever, this doesn't mean you can't make transfers of less than $20 through LN. For isolated channels, that would be the case unless you expected to be making loads of transfers through the channel in both directions. LN changes this equation by making every channel such that you can expect loads of transfers in both directions through the channel.\n\nThe answer is in the payment routing. You don't make a new channel to everyone you want to pay. Most of the time you just pay through the channels you already have. Same for receiving payments.\n\nSuppose you want to pay your friend, let's call him Bob. Bob has a payment channel with the grocery store he frequently shops at. You have a channel with your own grocery store. Neither of you has any other channels.\n\nSo, how does LN help here? The grocery stores might have a channel between themselves. Or perhaps they both have channels with the same supplier. Or perhaps there's just another customer with channels to both stores.\n\nIn any case, it's highly likely there exists a route of channels from you to Bob. So, when you decide to send Bob $10, your wallet will search for usable routes, pick the cheapest one and execute the transfer. All without anything at all being recorded on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nSo basically, Bob will actually receive $10 through his grocery store channel. Bob's grocery store in turn will receive $10 from your grocery store (if they have a direct channel) and you will send $10 to your grocery store.\n\nOf course, some fees will most likely be involved but probably not very big ones. Internal LN competition will ensure they get low enough to be only barely worth charging.\n\nIn case Bob wants to pay you, the same just happens in reverse.\n": 1, "That's helpful.

The asset is limited and fungible like gold, but unique and monitorable on the blockchain, unlike gold. There is a clear distinction between the underlying asset (blockchain bitcoins) and the asset in the IOU, loan contracts denominated in bitcoin with interest, which is an improvement over fiat.  The loan contracts can be made transparent and quite enforceable with help of blockchain technology.
