Bitcoin is a protocol like what email or the web run on. It's an open source technology. It can be changed to become better. It already has gotten better. It's not going to just stop. Email is not the same as it was 20 years ago. Neither is the web. In fact nothing you touch on the Internet is the same as it was 20 years ago. The idea that it would stagnate is absurd.\n\n2. Centralization due to file size isn't the one people are really worried about. Storage is one of the technologies that is growing much faster than need. Bandwidth may be a problem. But Bitcoin will learn to handle it. Side chains, Lightning, and the new thing by 21 will all help.\n\n3. Once Bitcoin adoption grows to a certain point you won't need to trade it for fiat script at a bank. As more people accept it and more people spend it, they'll just start doing it directly totally bypassing the paper. Look at OpenBazaar. As far as anonymity goes, I can't answer that part. But with JoinMarket, tumblers, and all the services that are being talked about, anonymous could return to Bitcoin.\n\n4. It's 7 years old. Seriously... 7 years. Anything 7 years old is volatile. The US Dollar was volatile 7 years in. I would say that stability comes with time, but look at gold or oil and their volatility records. Fiat has the appearance of stability compared to those, sure. But the volatility comes from when you go to the grocery store or gas pump.": 1, "1: Better technology may come along. However, first of all Bitcoin is not finished yet. If a better idea comes along and it's really a fundamental improvement, then what's keeping us from integrating that into Bitcoin as well? \n\nSecond, the success of Bitcoin is *way* more that just the technology. After 7 years, the eco system of business and services around Bitcoin, the market acceptance and adoption rate, the user base, the network size, and so on.. This is *extremely* crucial for Bitcoin or a potential successor. So just better technology certainly won't replace Bitcoin by itself.\n\n2: Increased number of file sizes? What? I assume you're talking about the size of the blockchain. Currently, the entire blockchain, containing ALL of Bitcoin's world wide balance history and transaction data of over 7 years, fits on less than $2 of disk space. **Two U.S. dollars worth of storage space**. Exactly what was the problem, again?\n\n3: Anonimity has nothing to do with them being able to freeze or seize your bitcoins. Even if they know who you are, they can't take your bitcoins. But the anonimity thing is a non-issue. Even if you have to buy bitcoins through exchanges where you have to identify yourself, you can anonymize them immediately through tumblers, mixers, coinjoin, pooled wallets, and plenty other of options.\n\nMore importantly, buying bitcoins with fiat is not the only way to get bitcoins. Do you currently buy your Euros or US dollars or whatever fiat currency you use? Probably not. No, you can *earn* them, by getting paid for your products or services directly in bitcoin. When Bitcoin hits mainstream adoption, this will be common.\n\n4: Currently, this is certainly a problem. I expect (and hope) this will stabalize if more and more people are getting into Bitcoin and start using it. The larger the market, the less influence from buy ins or sell offs. \n\nSecond, like you said, it's volatile when compared to fiat. More exact, it's volatile as long as we keep expressing the value of one bitcoin in terms of fiat money. If Bitcoin would become a major currency (and make no mistake, I have no illusions that this will happen anytime soon, but *if*) then it doesn't matter how much euros or pounds or dollars it's worth.

No one argue\'s against this, every participant here and developer agree\'s with that statement. When block size fills, it creates economic pressure.\n\nAs soon as that occurs (as it has occurred in the past), fee\'s will rise. As fee\'s rise, we are pricing out the poor. Right now it costs roughly 2 cents to send a dollar through the blockchain. When a artificial fee market is created, that number will obviously rise.\n\nDo you really think that the poor have *any* amount of money to loose? \n\nThe question at hand is where is the balance between security and cost. We have so much hashing power right now that there is no chance of any attack. We could loose 70% of the mining equipment of the world to a fire right now and we would still not be in any fear of attack.\n\nSo rationalizing that we need more hashing power is a irrational position. We clearly do not need more security *at this moment*, just like we are not in any fear of the halving causing any major security implications. Considering we have LTC\'s havling to look to, they did not loose *any* hashing power at the halving. Speculation is that chinese mining equipment is operating on zero or near zero cost for electricity and that they will continue to mine through several halvings through the life of the mining equipment as their cost is not any greater due to low cost electricity.\n\nSo arguing that we should develop a fee market when we are clearly not in need of any security is not only irrational, its intentionally obscuring the real issue. The real issue is about decentralization, not hashing power, and a small blocksize raise has been proven through much analysis to have no impact on current node count. \n\nThis is why segwit is being deployed, because it is believed by core that a 2-4mb raise will not effect node count to any dangerous level.\n\nSo, playing economic policy *dictator* by imposing artificial monetary policy is creating a economic event that changes the economy of bitcoin.\n\nThats *not* cool, and its not cool for *many* reasons, just *one* of the being that it unfairly prices out poorer people around the world from participating on the market. They do not have *any* amount of money to lose.\n\nTLDR - let the free market continue to develop the fee market, as satoshi himself originally intended.': 1, 'The built in ability of the technology to fork and route around censorship and centralization is why I support Bitcoin in the first place!': 14, "> Earlier user said it wasn't mentioned in the article, which it was.\n\nBut only indirectly - that the point.": 1, "This whole thing is such a clusterfuck.

Otherwise it's just words...": 1, 'DONT FORK. KEEP BLOCKSIZE SMALL.\n\nThe reluctance of many miners to back forks that increase block size is likely based on profit considerations. Keeping the blocksize small incentives BTC users to pay transaction fees for urgent transactions, which go right to the bottom line of the miners.\n\nThis is a good thing, because it increases miners\' incentive to keep competing by increasing their hash power, which in turn increases forgery protection. Remember that the giant, ASIC-based hash power behind BTC makes it the most secure digital ledger on this planet, which is the single most important feature holders of BTCs require (if they think about it for minute).\n\nThe value of BTC increases only as long as people hoard (i.e. hold, i.e remain long) BTC. But when you hoard currency over a longer period, security (not convenience) becomes the most important concern.\n\nSo, it would be in the best interest of anyone here who holds significant amounts of BTC and anyone here who mines BTC to reconsider supporting forks that increase the blocksize.\n\nThose who think BTC is about paying for latte macchiatos at Starbucks should find some worthless "EasyPeasyCoin" to spend.

You're using the same flawed logic as those who call Classic an altcoin because it changes the consensus rules.

What Bitcoin is is not just decided by the miners, but by the entire ecosystem. Anyway this discussion about how to call each coin after such a fork is pointless, Bitcoin basically would split in two Bitcoins (Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Classic) because the community is divided and many will pick a side they see as the one and only true Bitcoin.

But I was specifically responding to him making the claim that "NO one will stay on a chain that has 40% of hashpower." and how it doesn\'t really accurately describe what could potentially happen. I think his perception is wrong because I don\'t think he\'s considering the full range of potential outcomes based on him making such a comment with absolute certainty. \n\nI\'m confident that there\'s a not insignificant amount of people who have no interest continuing on the Classic chain. So at the very least, the most minimal impact this group of people could have is selling their BTC on the new chain and not participating after that. Not even considering the alternate scenarios of a PoW change and such, there are a lot of people in the \'no interest in Classic group\' who have been around Bitcoin for a very long time, and would be considered early adopters who will want out. So I think it\'s likely based on the current situation staying the same that there will be more supply than demand should Classic successfully execute their hard fork.\n\nI don\'t claim to know anything with certainty. But it\'s also clear that people seem to have been mislead as to what the actual range of outcomes could be should the hard fork actually happen.

Even one dude like Mircea dumping would be a shitload of BTC. 5 figures of BTC, quite possibly 6 figures depending on who you believe. And that's just a one person. There are a lot of people who have been around for a long time who wouldn't have interest in holding Classic BTC.\n\nI find it a bit odd that so many people who support Classic outright disbelieve that many of the people who are against it will sell their coins on that chain.

NO one will stay on a chain that has 40% of hashpower.\n\n\nIf the coins on the minority chain suddenly became more valuable to mine than the coins on the majority chain because of low hashing power and high speculative potential causing a rush of investors, many miners would switch to the minority chain to get superior profits. This sudden increase of hashing power on the minority chain, which everyone presumed was going to zero, will diminish the certainty that the chain was going to be the one to die, causing even more risk seeking speculators and investors to rush back in. Long investors who sold their minority chain would panic and buy back in. \n\nThis could potentially cause a back and forth for some time as investors and speculators panic, switch coins, or dump both coins entirely. Suddenly there would be the very real possibility in investors minds that either coin could go to zero, and everyone would rush to exit the system, you would have a massive depreciation of value of both coins. The dropping prices of both coins would be worsened by the fact that investors would now be holding twice as many coins as they started with, so with both chains being valuable the sum market cap of Bitcoin would be split between the two coins. So you would have faith and confidence in Bitcoin as a whole rapidly eroding, *and* you would have the price pressure downward from value being split among two coins. There could be a run for the exits, we could see Bitcoin get into single digits. As speculators rushed to take advantage of these cheap prices, there would be no guarantee which chain they would pick to primarily invest in, and this would lead to more, prolonged division between the coins, with the political and technical war continuing.\n\nThe chaos could be potentially devastating to Bitcoin's reputation precisely at a time when negative interest rates and financial chaos are leaving global investors desperately looking for safety. If Bitcoin no longer appeared relatively safe -- a status which has taken years to achieve -- it would not be poised to take advantage of the chaos in the global economy. This would further erode confidence in the prospects of the currency and cause more investors to dump, increasing price volatility and the chaos amongst the mining community.

Unless you anticipate going to court over something like this.\n\n\nSee comment of /u/ichabodsc who remarked that what is happening here "might end up being binding in California bankruptcy court, but nowhere else.  Persuasive, maybe, but the IRS, CFPB, and any other entities can continue choosing their own definitions."\n\n\n\nI disagree that merchants and individuals will have a tough time if a California court classifies it as a commodity because people will keep doing routine transactions, donations, disputes and refunds, however they want.  However, if they are actually disclosing the transactions under the tax code (as businesses or nonprofits might choose to do especially if they are trying to get deductions in the US) then this kind of thing applies:\n\n\n\n"As a brief description of  CA State law which has focused on this issue, cryptocurrency is understood to be legal to to transact with in California pursuant to AB 129 (\'Lawful Money,\' approved by the California Governor June 28, 2014, filed with Secretary of State June 28, 2014).  Additionally, the IRS treats cryptocurrency as property, so this means that from a reporting standpoint, [donors who choose to take a deduction will be at an advantage](http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetnovack/2014/12/22/how-to-donate-bitcoin-to-charity-and-get-a-big-tax-deduction/#4face44d3b6e).\n\n\nAs per IRS Notice 2014-21, most individuals or organizations receiving the virtual currency as a donation, though it is not technically a payment for goods or services, would be required to (in computing gross income) include the fair market value of virtual currency in U.S. dollars as of the date of payment or receipt.  Because the virtual currency (cryptocurrency) in question is listed on an exchange and the exchange rate is established by market supply and demand, the fair market value of the virtual currency is determined by converting the virtual currency into U.S. dollars (or into another real currency which in turn can be converted into U.S. dollars) at the exchange rate, in a reasonable manner that is consistently applied.  (An example of such an exchange is https://hitbtc.com/ which shows currency pairs such as BCN-to-BTC and BTC-to-USD.) \n\nHowever, for nonprofits or exempt organizations, any gains accrued due to the appreciation of digital currency assets are non-taxable.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, most donors will now realize an extremely attractive tax benefit when donating appreciated cryptocurrency.  (An example of a nonprofit that has done so is BitGive.)  Thus, cryptocurrency donations to, for example, 501c(3) organizations that have announced their acceptance of cryptocurrencies, may be written off at fair market value without creating a capital gains tax liability for donors.  A multi-step guide to donations for individuals, nonprofits or exempt organizations [can be found here](http://www.investopedia.com/university/definitive-bitcoin-tax-guide-dont-let-irs-snow-you/definitive-bitcoin-tax-guide-chapter-2-bitcoin-commerce-taxable-events-b-donations.asp) that focuses on cryptocurrency."\n\n\n\nMost people probably don\'t bother to disclose their cryptocurrency activity, and I\'m personally not an advocate of allowing the State a window into one\'s financial affairs.  But if you choose to do so, then there are ample ways to utilize your cryptocurrency activity in a way that can create huge write-off possibilities - because the IRS allows those who donate cryptocurrency directly to a registered charity that has a wallet address, to write off the full fair-market value of donated property (cryptocurrency), which has been held for longer than a year (up to 30% of one\'s adjusted gross income), without you or the charity paying any capital-gains taxes - which is significant for cryptocurrency investors and charities alike.\n\n\n\nCYA Note:  The above should in no way be construed as legal or investment advice.

If the hard-fork has unanimous consensus among Bitcoin users, then Bitcoin users will let Bitcoin die and adopt the new system, which they may or may not still call Bitcoin.\n\nA hard-fork does not mean to change a rule at some point of time (block height). The fact that a static rule is substituted by one that has a dynamical evolution is just a trick to make the UTXO set at some point coincide in both systems to make the hard-fork more acceptable, but it is not at all inherent to the system, which has thus no subjectivity: the system is still a genesis block and a set of consensus rules, none of which depends on a past observed state or checkpoint.': 1, "That's true, seems like their partnership with Voxelus is supposed to make both of them look more important than they are.": 4, 'Yep, check out the Nabc episode of Bitcoin uncensored, Michael terpin (the guy who pumps it) explains how it works about 3/4 in.': 3, 'I tweeted to them about this last week and got no response. \n\nhttps://twitter.com/JonnyBitcoin/status/696196592580349952': 4, '*formerly': 1, "I am also a satisfied user of Uphold - use it to buy smaller amounts of BTC with no commission.  \n\nHaven't run the numbers myself, but +$155k is basically bankrupt.

Glad you watched the movies, it tells me we can try to understand each other.\n\n> But they don\'t speculate-- they reallocate assets to match obligations on a risk-based basis. \n\nTo me, this is speculating.  The devil is in the phrase "risk based basis."  What does this mean exactly? Some operating binder filled with math I suppose -- and is this public?  At the end of the day though, small risks can balloon into large risks in seeming violation of statistical properties. Because statistics are hard to get right, which was the underlying message of the movie Margin Call.\n\n> What make you think this will change? What makes you think they will do a big bad trade? Why would they?\n\nHere is a scenario.  Halsey\'s anti-bitcoin bias is transmitted to the risk management team, and Uphold tendency is to run a bitcoin deficit.  The bitcoin price makes a large upward move.  The Uphold risk management team thinks they are hedged because of their large dollar reserve.  But, when it\'s clear that the large btc move is potentially parabolic and they start buying bitcoin to cover, this pushes the price higher yet, in violation of their models.  (Granted the current net bitcoin deficit is currently not that big, but this is more to explain my thinking of what could go wrong rather than pointing a finger at something currently broken.)  Further, the Uphold model assumes bitcoin can be borrowed at low rates to cover "bank runs" but in a parabolic up move, rates also spike, and there are shortages of bitcoin available for shorting and other borrowing purposes, making this more difficult.  \n\nIn summary, my position is that Uphold should be two (decoupled) operations, a holding company with very small fees for holding (negative interest) and minimal risk (no trading risk, only counterparty risk) and a second company for trading (which pays positive interest).  It should be possible to invest in either operation, and the risk should be explicit.  That\'s just how it should work.\n\nFurther, the transparency page is great, but to my knowledge Uphold does not do merkle proof of reserves on its bitcoin assets, nor is it clear to me how this bitcoin is being held -- is it just on an exchange somewhere?  Perhaps you know more about this since you\'ve done the due diligence, if so I would be interested to get the full story.\n\nThe merkle proofs apply to all crypto, so actually to voxel as well.  (I am unimpressed by voxel btw but that\'s irrelevant to discussion of overall risk profile.)\n\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=merkle+reserve+proof\n\nThe fact that many exchanges don\'t do cryptographic proof of reserve doesn\'t excuse Uphold from doing this on their claimed crypto reserves, if indeed it is in a wallet where they control the privkeys.  And if it\'s not, there is again counterparty risk (hidden from depositors).  Some exchanges *are* starting to do proof of reserves, slowly and dragging their heels but it\'s happening.\n\nFurthermore, even for the fiat (or the crypto if it is with third parties) there is another technical means for verifying funds, tlsnotary on cached web pages from the third party, that confirm funds availability.  Uphold isn\'t doing this either.  And neither is anyone else really, but again that doesn\'t excuse it.\n\nIn short, if Uphold really wants to be a paragon for a new model, they should at least pay lip service to crypto proof of reserves for their cold crypto assets, and tlsnotary for everything else.  They don\'t have to do be doing it actively, but they should at least put it on the road map.\n\nBut Halsey Minor is a bitcoin skeptic, and I suspect he is pretty firmly in the "old model" where funds are secured by the threat of arresting and ruining custodians if they cheat, but without real technical verification with teeth (crypto proof of reserve / tlsnotary).\n\n': 6, 'Total utter garbage': 1, 'Not really, the voxelus chain is a joke.

It's a real boon to international trade as there's no conversion fees, bank fees, or really anything else and within a nation can be used to easily transfer money while avoiding the 1-3% fees Visa/Mastercard charge.  Keeping fees and allowing transaction times to take longer will get rid of these major benefits.  At some point just waiting on a bank transfer will be easier.\n\nWhile regulation can lead to centralization it's obviously happened with little regulation now in BTC as well and I wouldn't really think increasing blocksize is similar to regulation anymore so than keeping the blocksize the same is (probably less so, keeping it small is an inhibiting factor that forces more fees when they otherwise wouldn't be needed.)\n\nRewards have gone down for a long time, that will happen regardless...but four years is a long time in technology.

Do you concur?': 0, "Okay, but:\n\nNote that higher profits DO NOT lead to more mining centralization,  but exactly the opposite.

If we really already had secure (non-forgeable) AND cheap (low tx cost) currencies, we wouldn't need BTC, would we?\n\nThird point. No, the security (non-forgeability) of BTC depends on mining power, which costs money to deploy and run. The decision is exactly about security vs. tx costs.": -2, "Okay, but we've had the fee issue increase as mining has centralized, right?  Why would we think that continuing this would magically make things better?  Whether or not higher fees are related to centralization they definitely haven't been associated with a lessening of it.  Not to mention the idea that higher profit margins equalling more competition is kind of silly.  Look at traditional banking, it has higher profit margins and has been centralizing more and more the more money is involved.  Not to mention that the cost of equipment needed to get any significant money from mining is now untenable for anyone not already well financed.\n\nThe secure, non-forgeable, cheap currency I was referring to was BTC...I'm not sure how long you've been using it but it's been all those things until recently without problem (including having a decentralized mining pool.)\n\nWhile I realize that mining power influences security, what I'm saying is that fees will not cause it to increase significantly because the fees are distributed equally regardless of total mining power.  The more diversity the less profit from fees.  There was a time when miners made their money off of actually mining BTC, not relying on others to fund their endeavor (I did so.)  I think the security is naturally well past what it needs to be so incentivizing mining more is unnecessary.  There are diminishing returns on security in this instance due to disincentivization regarding the difficulty in use and centralization that would occur.": 3, "If that were the case, miners could already exclude transactions with fees that are too low for their liking. If they have a monopoly in deciding what is the minimum fee for a transaction to get included, then bigger blocks would still be beneficial for them. More expensive transactions to process per 10 minutes. \n\n\nAnd mining is not expensive, nor cheap. Mining, by definition, will run approximately break even. If it were expensive, miners would quit and it would become less expensive. If it were cheap (i.e. profitable) more people would start mining and it would become more expensive. So **regardless of the actual cost** mining isn't expensive.": 2, 'The first part of your comment is definitely wrong, the last sentence may be correct. I will reply to the first, wrong part and think about the last sentence of your comment some more.\n\nBank profits are outsized because banks can create money out of thin air using a monopoly granted to them by the govt.  Furthermore, bank profits are supported by the fact that governments are effectively guaranteeing to bail out banks that lends recklessly as long as the bank is very large, creating incentives to have very large banks. Further, in a half-assed attempt to control their banks, the govts also force banks to comply to large amounts of regulations. In any industry, regulation leads to centralization, because per dollar revenue it is cheaper for the big players to comply with regulations than it is for the small players. This keeps competition away which increases profits for the established big players.\n\nNone of the above applies to BTC, thank god. In case of BTC, more mining profits means more miners, less centralization as in any other un-regulated industry.\n\nConcerning the distribution of mining fees: currently, the freshly minted coins make up 99% of miner profit. But do not forget, that will change as the reward is halved every four years. Soon, miners must rely more on tx fees.

A limit doesn't increase fees but actually hinders overall returns.\n\n>Therefore profits will fall freely until only one miner is left, who would then be in a place to impose any fees he likes.\n\nI don't follow the logic.

Its kind of fucked, because if the banks do use alot of these reserves then it makes their money less valuable since it would cause inflation (assuming the Fed doesn't sell bonds/act in response).
