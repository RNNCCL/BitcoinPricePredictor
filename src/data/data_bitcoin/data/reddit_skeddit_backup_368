But if you think about this further, it could create an incentive to break the economic chain of mining a block into smaller parts:\n\nYour small miner could collect many small transactions that would pay him and then rent enough hashing power to finish that block.\n\nThis lending of hashing power could be automated happen at very short time scales (< 1s). Furthermore, small miners could create profiles on where they want to direct their hashing power and could channel it to whatever pool they favor for a healthy mining ecosystem...\n\nThis would all be possible with the protocol as-is. The question remains how much of this fragmentation is actually wanted and needed by Bitcoin.\n\nOne point remains after all, though: Users, the most decentralized entity of all in Bitcoin, have all the freedom to choose their miner, if they want to support their local one. Just include an additional payment to your local miner in your transactions....\n": 1, "Isn't this only true when you assume that 100% of the people will use this system? Which to me is very unlikely, because when people realise the result is a centralization of mining, they will just send their transaction to all the miners.\n\nTo me, it seems like just a possibility for the end user to affect the miners.": 2, "I was arguing about the fact that if you allow a user to whitelist his miners, then you'll ends up by having a more centralized system instead of decentralized one, since the unknown miner will have no way to get the transactions.\n\nIt would also oblige miners to be identified instead of anonymous.": 2, '> This only makes sense as an incentive to decentralize mining if the fee is removed and replaced by an equal miner-specific output. Otherwise, you\'re just making a donation to a specific miner, which is costing you more and thus not viable as a long term solution.\n\nWhy so? It is just an imperfect way to have your special miner mining the transaction. You are expressing a preference, as a user, but you aren\'t able to simply express a 100% preference (due to the obligatory fee for forwarding) for a single miner. Only asymptotically.\n\n> Finally how can you ever know that a "smaller miner" is not just a bigger miner in sheep\'s clothing?\n\nThis isn\'t really on-topic anymore, but: By knowing your miner personally or from trusted friends?\n': 1, "That idea is very interesting, but for a very specific reason:\n\nWe hear all the time about mining centralization and how it must be counteracted through changes in the protocol. We also hear about the long-term miner economy and how a centrally planned blocksize limit must be put into place to prop it up artificially.\n\nThe reason being, that the Bitcoin network will supposedly fall apart completely if not for these measures of economic intervention by the devs.\n\nAnd what you describe would be a way to squash the stupid arguments along these lines completely! There will only be as much mining centralization as *users* will allow... \n\nAnd *users* are the most decentralized entity in Bitcoin. So the argument for centrally planning blocksize is unmasked pretty well as an argument from an 'I know better what you want' arrogant perspective...\n": 2, "Interesting idea. While we're throwing spaghetti at the wall, I've always wondered if a kind of mining insurance couldn't fix the variance issue of the block reward. \n\nIf (big if) there were a way to prove you are hashing at a certain rate on the current puzzle, and you could get paid through a payment channel by the millisecond for each attempt, you could have insurance providers get the block reward if you find it, and if not you get a slightly lower payout from the insurance provider. This could be set up through smart contracts in an insurance market, so that anyone could make a few percent on their money by depositing it into the insurance program, much like a bank account. Then risk would be pooled, but mining would not be, because the pool wouldn't be centralized.": 1, "Why so? This could be done over whatever channel miners + users whish to communicate.\n\nIt isn't really a whitelist - it is an expression of preference for a certain miner by a user.": 1, 'So?

The point is that s/he can choose already.': 1, "This would work if there was some way to specify that the output could go to any miner that wasnt on a given list. I am pretty sure the protocol doesn't currently allow for this, but I don't see why it couldn't.

Now that I think about it, your post should indeed go to the top. This should make the the 'miners need to be a lot more decentralized' - people happy, as this would be a way to support their local neighborhood miner. And they could start a movement for locally grown mining blocks :-)": 2, "I don't decide for anyone, I just point out that the result of such feature goes against the goal stated.\n\nIf the user wants more centralization, then in this case, it is rational for him to follow this idea.": 1, 'This is essentially what pools already do. Your insurance providers would just substitute them. ': 2, "You are arguing that economy of scale will tend to favor the big miners. That is true - but is it bad in any way, and should it be counteracted by core devs?

So it has no cryptographic assumptions other than those of Bitcoin.\n\nFor example, take this transaction from May 27th: https://blockchain.info/tx/2d444019f29e375a408df1387e4ee6fb19ec0399db31609ae552ce4b1fae6c7b - an 11 party JoinMarket join. Notice that 11 different outputs have the same btc amount. It is *fundamentally* indistinguishable as to which of the inputs instigated which output. The other outputs are a different story - they are called 'change' outputs and they certainly can, in principle, be linked to various of the inputs, usually probabilistically but sometimes near-deterministically.\n\nThere are important security (and crypto) issues to be addressed and peer reviewed, but they are kind of 'higher level' - the messages between counterparties are E2E encrypted - is that done right? If not, then Coinjoin's promise is irrelevant (edit: well, not irrelevant - there's still value for everyone when the assumption 'all inputs come from one user' is broken), as a snooper can see which outputs were requested by which inputs, and so the joining at the transaction level becomes useless.\n\nAlso note Joinmarket's intrinsic asymmetry - the requester of the join (who pays a fee for this privilege) gets his join done immediately, and moreover has the privilege of constructing the entire transaction and therefore knowing who requested which output. For this reason, the 'makers' (the ones offering the join liquidity) don't get the same privacy as the 'taker' (who pays the fee). It's still a considerable privacy bump for their utxos anyway, of course.\n\nNote that there are additional proposals, such as the blinding mechanism described in the CoinJoin post I linked above as well as 'CoinShuffle' (think Bitcoin + onion routing) - there's a paper out there that's quite readable.

Not for normal people. ;-)\n\n> A flat rate could very easily and quickly (and cheaply) be used to absolutely fill up the mempool essentially creating a DDOS for legitimate transactions.\n\nHow exactly would a flat rate *per output* be worse than the current model in that regard?": -1, 'If transaction priorities are determined by fees, whether paid by the UTXO creator or by its consumer, an attacker can keep transactions off the blockchain for an indefinite time by issuing enough spam transactions with fees higher than them.  Even if the client uses replace-by-fee to increase his own fees, the attacker can simply increase his own too.  \n\nWith variable fees, clients with deep pockets may still be able to get through by paying an exorbitant fee that the attacker may be unwilling to pay.  (With 1 MB blocks, in order to block a transaction with fee X he has to continuously issue a bit more than 1800 to 2500 new transactions with fee X+1, every 10 minutes.)  But the attacker will still be able to block transactions of clients that paid a higher-than standard fee but could not remain on-line to readjust their fees.\n\nIn contrast, if the fee was fixed by the proocol, all the attacker could do is to dilute the legitimate traffic.  Suppose that a spam attack created a backlog of 15\'000 transactions, and a new simple transaction is issued.  With fixed fees, 1 MB blocks, 70% filled, and 700 bytes/tx average, that transaction will be very probably serviced in the next 15 blocks -- ***no matter what the attacker does next***.\n\nA reader in bitcointalk suggested that this "stress test" may be an attempt by a large miner to force everybody to increase their fees so that his revenue will increase.  By my quick estimates, indeed a 20% miner could have collected ~10\'000 USD of extra fee revenue by investing maybe 5000 USD.  That is peanuts for a 20% miner, but it means that a spam attack can be self-financing if carried out by a large miner.  That is, the miner can keep spamming for an indefinite length of time, with increasingly higher fees, forcing everybody to spend more and more, while making a small profit instead of a huge loss.  Eventually, his profit may be large enough to make the attack worthwhile.  \n\nWith fixed fees, set in the consensus rules, this miner strategy does not seem viable.': 1, 'What is "what"?\n\nAs I said in the OP, a flat fee *per output* would make the fees more understandable and acceptable to clients, even to old computer science professors.  \n\nA *significant* minimum fee per transaction would reduce traffic by discouraging many "spurious" uses that are viable only by offloading 100% of the cost to others; that would make it easier to run non-selfish full nodes and postpone saturation by a year or more.  It would also make spam attacks (like this stress test, but hostile) much more expensive, hence unlikely.\n\nA *fixed* and significant fee per output, defined in the \'consensus rules\', would also remove many pages of code from the core and from all wallets, an many pages of explanations in btcoin primers.

Whereas, with a fixed transaction fee, miners would have little incentive to change the chronological order of transactions; so the attacker will be able to slow the legitimate traffic down by diluting it in spam, but cannot prevent it from being processed.\n\nAnd, once more: bitcoin will be unusable if traffic is allowed to get close to its capacity.
