It will change nothing.\n\nYou\'re falling into the trap of assuming that I\'m advocating for settlement layer only or for bitcoin to be merely digital gold.  But besides, no, bitcoin being the everyday currency or used institutionally has little bearing on whether government is able to control it.  Because that has little to do with the ability to access it.  At one point, nearly everybody used gold (or silver) for their everyday transactions. . .this did not prevent gov\'t from controling gold, and subsequently destroying its moneyness.  Bitcoin only has a chance to succeed where gold failed because its digital nature and cryptographic properties lend it to skirting regulations and bans.  It gives us (we hope) slightly better tools with which to resist government intrusion.  Ultimately, the success of bitcoin in overcoming gov\'t attempts at control and manipulation are entirely at the mercy of the number of people who demand non-governmental money and who will break laws or at least operate in grey markets in order to get what they want and preserve free-enterprise.  \n\nIt is often parroted that if *X* country bans bitcoin. . .well, another part of the globe will simply accept of it and profit.  Yet, money is the ultimate network good (or dependent on network effects); we could have said the same of gold: "well, if FDR wants to confiscate and ban use of gold, the rest of the world will just use gold and profit".  Of course, they couldn\'t actually confiscate gold from everybody, nor did they try. . .but simply threatening with legal consequences, destroys the network effect, and ultimately, the rest of the world had to follow suit.  A money allowed only in a minority of places, is by definition, not a money.  It is the fact that bitcoin is native to the internet; a territory that is at least somewhat sovereign from governments, that primarily gives us hope that it can overcome the network-effect-destroying power of government threats. . . .not whether its our payment network or not.\n\n>The inflation control that bitcoin provides might as well not exist if people cannot use it.

Bitcoin is not, and never was, anti-bank (though there's promise that it could render some banking functions obsolete).  Bitcoin is about money.  Not a payment network.  There are already plenty of payment networks.  And (especially with Bitcoin lighting a fire under the fintech and payments industry), centralized services will always be able to, all other things equal, produce faster, cheaper, more user-friendly payment rails than blockchains.\n\nbitcoins (the commodity or currency units) necessarily had to be integrated with their own payment network, Bitcoin, because they are virtual and digital and cannot be transmitted by physical means (at least not to the extent that you can transfer dollar bills or gold coins, etc.).  The utility of the Bitcoin network, including its usefulness as a payment rail or proxy for fiat currency, is certainly one of the things which helps to bootstrap the otherwise useless bitcoin unit into circulation and use as a medium of exchange, store of value, and unit of account (i.e. money).\n\nIf Bitcoin creates one more payment network in the world (which of course does have the benefits of better censorship-resistance and thus more international utility), the world will be a slightly better place.  But if we can actually [bootstrap](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3zw3yg/quest_to_find_satoshi_highlights_biggest_threat/cypj3ir) bitcoin into position as a new, independent, sovereign, currency and monetary system...I think that's going to have a much greater impact (you decide whether you think that's for better or for worse).  Thinking along these lines and understanding what money is and how it is developed on a voluntary market (rather than declared by government fiat) should lead you to at least comprehend that bitcoin is primarily anti-state.  Banks will probably always have some niche to fill in society, regardless of which money unit they are storing, or transferring or investing or insuring for us. . . but it is the state that cannot survive in its current common forms, without direct control over the monetary unit and the money supply. That's just the cold, hard reality of it.  That is why those of us who took note of bitcoin early on, were excited by it.  That is the ultimate promise of value which bitcoin may be able to provide: just a little bit more freedom from the state.   \n\nIf it helps you avoid a few bank fees, and gives you a hip way to buy your coffee in the morning, that's great. . . but hardly revolutionary, no?": 23, "Shorting doesn't hurt the economy.": 1, 'I saw it because of this post.

At least, that's anecdotally the sense I got from everyone else early on, and the expectation that hard-forking in the future was only going to be possible and necessary under imminent crisis.  Bitcoin was not good enough, in its inception or right now, to serve as a replacement for any significant mainstream payment network (again; this doesn't mean I'm opposed to allowing the protocol to accommodate as many transactions as possible!). . .but bitcoin has always been good enough to become a monetary system and money unit.\n\nI know it's tantamount to heresy in this community to say this (and no, I'm not sympathetic to Theymos at all or censoring comments the way he has): but I'm sorry, the blocksize issue is nowhere near a crisis-level event yet.
