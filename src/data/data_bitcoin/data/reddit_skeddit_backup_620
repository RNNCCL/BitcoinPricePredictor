It's more a bitcoin-inspired company, like Itunes is an MP3-inspired company that has little in common with the original decentralized MP3 ventures like Napseter, Limewire, Kazaa, etc.\n\nBitcoin enables cloud value transfers that bypass banks, thus avoiding the banksters and their rip-off fees, delays, risk-taking. Bitreserve enables cloud money. It's a cloud money service and bitcoin is a way of moving value into Bitreserve. Bitreserve enables virtual assets (currently five major currencies and gold) whose value is backed by real assets held in their full reserve, and they do it with real-time transparency.\n\nSo they've taken the best aspects of bitcoin: avoiding banks and a public real-time ledger, and they've improved on it in many ways. Transfers of bitcoin, dollars, pounds, gold, etc in Bitreserve are instant and free vs. slowish and the bitcoin fee with bitcoin transfers on the blockchain. You lose the dencentralization and therefore you have counterparty risk with Bitreserve, but they are the first financial service in history to do real-time transparency-- so the counterparty risk is very, very low.  \n\nSo what can you use Bitreserve for? I've used it to go from BTC to USD instantly and at low-cost when BTC was crashing and to go from USD to BTC when I thought BTC had bottomed out. They are the cheapest way to convert value that I've found (Coinapult is B.S., Bitshares is slow). \n\nYou can also spend BTC from your stores of dollars or gold or whatever so you can participate in the bitcoin economy--which is a very, very cool experiment-- but not be exposed to any BTC volatility, which can wipe out a lot of value very quickly as we've seen over the past 12 months.\n\nThat's Bitreserve today: convert your BTC to stable value but still spend BTC on the bitcoin network + transfer BTC or USD or GLD instantly and for free to anyone, anytime, anywhere + real-time transparency so you know your value is safe, which means you don't have to be worry about being Goxed and if Bitreserve gets Bitstamped, it's all out in the open and the world will see it in real-time. No fucking waiting two weeks while Bistamp pulls their heads out of their ass.\n\nThat's today. What they say is that starting soon (next few months?) you'll be able to use your bitmoney to buy stuff, which makes sense to me because if you're a merchant with fiat costs and expenses, you want whatever money your costs and expenses are denominated in, not bitcoin (because of the volatility). And Bitreserve allows instant, zero-cost payments (no more credit card fees or fraud or chargebacks).\n\nSo today Bitreserve protects you from bitcoin volatility, if you want to use bitcoin but not lose your shirt.  Tomorrow you can spend your bitmoney with merchants, and by the end of the year they say there will be all sorts of apps built on top of their API that allow you to do all sorts of things-- remittance cash-out, IP rights payments, micropayments.\n\nBitreserve is good for bitcoin because it makes bitcoin more useful for commerce-- it will drive more people to buy bitcoin to get into bitmoney so they can use Bitreserve's cloud money service without having to be worried about bitcoin volatilty.\n\nBitreserve is good for merchants because they enable zero-cost payments with no fraud or chargebacks.\n\nBitreserve is good for poor people sending money home, because they enable zero-cost remittance with no bitcoin volatility risk and also low-cost currency conversions\n\nThey are good for the unbanked and working poor because eventually everyone will be able to store their money in the cloud with BR and no more fucking bounced check fees or minimum balance requirements.\n\nThey are going to be fucking awesome for developers because their API is open and anyone can start building something on top of them--I've got a few projects in the works myself.\n\nThey are not good for banksters and other shitheel financial intermediaries like Western Union.\n\nThey are a great for anyone who doesn't like banks blowing all depositors money on high-risk best and then getting the government to bail them out. \n\nSo start with bitcoin, use it, support the community. Try Bitreserve and see how they work-- convert your btc to usd with no settlement delays and cheaper than coinbase or circle, and with real-time transparency.  Spend btc from your usd or gld or euro card to support btc-accepting merchants.\n\nAnd keep an eye on the stuff they have coming down the pipe, because one thing I can say about Bitreserve is they never stop fucking doing interesting stuff: opening their venture round to the crowd on two different platforms, bitgold, bitoil. One thing they are not is boring.\n\nFull disclosure-- I know so much about BR because I did a shit-ton of diligence before investing some of my hard-earned shekels via Venovate.  I don't know if they're going to be knock it out of the park like they claim, but I like their odds because the dude behind Bitreserve has built like six hugely successful tech ventures (even if he's currently bankrupt).\n\nHope this helps.

The safest kind were the ones that wanted Oracle experience. You never had to worry about those. You were also safe if they said they wanted C++ or Java developers. If they wanted Perl or Python programmers, that would be a bit frightening-- that's starting to sound like a company where the technical side, at least, is run by real hackers.

It is used to describe a special type of cryptographic proof: zero-knowledge proofs. What this means is that, for example, Peggy can (mathematically, cryptographically) prove to Victor that she knows the password to open a secret door without telling Victor the password. The story given in the 1990 paper by Jean-Jacques Quisquater involves "Victor" observing "Peggy" going into a path with the secret door, and then coming out via an exit of his choosing. If Peggy repeatedly appears at the correct exit then it is overwhelmingly probable she knows the secret word to open the interleading door. If she fails to appear correctly even once, then she clearly does not know the secret word.\n\nThus, zero-knowledge proofs must have the normal properties of interactive proof systems, that is completeness (an honest verifier is completely convinced by an honest prover, if the statement is true) and soundness (within an acceptably small probability, no fake prover can convince an honest verifier that a false statement is true). The downside to these systems is that a fake verifier can learn the statement from an honest prover. The special property of interactive zero-knowledge proof systems is that a fake verifier only learns whether the statement is true or false, not what the statement is.\n\nThus, even Bitcoin has a form of "zero-knowledge proof", did you know that? When you sign a transaction and broadcast it, nodes are able to verify that your transaction is valid *even though they don\'t know your private key*. All public/private key cryptography is verifiable via a form of zero-knowledge proofs:)\n\nSpecifically in the context of cryptocurrencies, though, the original CryptoNote protocol, as well as Monero\'s push beyond that, has lead to a blockchain that is fully cryptographically verifiable, but it is impossible to know the value of a transaction or even who the recipient is. This is primarily due to a single special component: key images. Because key images are always unique, they prevent outputs from being double-spent (and thus breaking the cryptographically sound verification). Unsurprisingly, you\'ll find that ShadowCash reimplemented the key image functionality (which only exists courtesy of CryptoNote and, by extension, Monero), which is why they are able to claim that they have zero-knowledge proofs.\n\nDon\'t believe me? Here is their function to generate key images: https://github.com/SDCDev/shadowcoin/blob/master/src/ringsig.cpp#L165\n\nI really do recommend you spend some time researching and understanding the cryptography involved before making any further statements on this subject.': 8, 'Added your reply to the [FAQ page](https://xmrmonero.com/faq/en/%E2%80%8Bwhy-private-currency-important)': 1, 'Ad hominem is an argument for those who have none.': 0, 'Get involved in my project that uses coinjoin to improve the privacy of bitcoin transactions.

Linking Bitcoin it's self to ID is very hard as no ID is required to use/spend/receive Bitcoin. But once a link is made it becomes very easy to identify transactions and fallow their path (unless explicit actions are taken otherwise). Still it's more anonymous than your bank account. DPR didn't exactly seem  the greatest at OPSEC. \n\nEdit: Typos \n\n\n": 3, 'Sidechains will not help, and altcoins don\'t really help, either. It\'s dangerous to act as though they were solutions. There needs to be a community norm that you support and use anonymity, even if you feel you don\'t need it. If that norm isn\'t adopted and followed, you get something very much like a free rider problem that ends up hurting everybody.\n\nIf anonymous money is only available in walled gardens, then moving money in or out of those walled gardens becomes suspicious. If using anonymity costs more, in money or effort or safety, than being non-anonymous, and if there\'s no strong norm against *not* using anonymity, then anonymity is very likely to have only a few users. And even if you do manage to get a lot of users with walled gardens, each individual garden will only have a few. You want them all using one big system, so that they\'re indistinguishable. Fragmentation loses much of the value of anonymity, thus driving down adoption even further.\n\nIn a world where anonymity is optional (especially if\'s rare), using it gets a new, extra cost: by doing it, you put on a big "I have something to hide" sign. This drives the user adoption down even further, which in turn makes using anonymity still riskier.\n\nIn the end, you end up with an anonymous garden that\'s occupied only by a few true believers and by people who *really* have something to hide. Which has terrible optics. You obviously won\'t know exactly what people are hiding, but there will be a widespread (possibly true) belief that the anonymous garden is only for illicit transactions. At that point authorities have every incentive to outlaw anonymity. And there\'s nobody to fight against that, because most users won\'t see it as their problem, and the ones who *do* see it as their problem would be stuck *losing* their anonymity to fight publicly. But at this point, we\'ve limited that set to only the people who have a lot to lose, so they understandably won\'t do that.\n\nSo you end up with no useful anonymity. And then the problems set in. You lose fungibility, and then the whole currency fails (or becomes slower and more expensive than existing banks, which is really the same thing). Not only does it fail, but it may leave behind a poisoned, anti-anonymity regulatory environment that makes it very hard to start over. Once you start letting actors "opt out" of anonymity, everybody has an incentive to free ride.\n\nDominant currencies need to be *natively* anonymous as the *default* mode.': 5, 'I\'d argue that there is another option. If I may demonstrate: Monero currently implements cryptographically sound transactional unlinkability and untraceability. However, it allows individuals to (completely optionally) give their "view key" to a select few, or to the government, or even publish it somewhere.\n\nA view key can be used to reveal all transactions for an account. This means that companies could still be audited, charities could make their accounts publicly visible, and parents could see what their kids are spending the money on. Additionally, details of a transaction can be revealed via a similar mechanism on a per-transaction basis.\n\nSo the option I alluded to earlier is this: there already exists a cryptocurrency that has privacy by default, transparency optional. Governments wouldn\'t need to outlaw it, as law enforcement could still be given the tools to investigate illicit transactions (although they\'d need to ask for the person\'s viewkey first, but that\'s no different than asking for someone\'s password to reveal incriminating evidence on their computer).': 14, 'Great post.

It allows for more efficient storage of transaction data, by  having it split up into different sections, and each section stored by the group that most actively uses it, and by splitting up the load of transaction validation, it reduces the resource requirements for participating in transaction validation, allowing the Bitcoin ecosystem to scale without decentralization suffering.\n\nSo you're doing a poor job trolling.": 5, "Here's the other challenge... your privacy is at the mercy of the other 4 participants not screwing up.
