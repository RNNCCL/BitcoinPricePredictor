Whether this is good or bad depends on your individual situation / preference. Also in the US you are able to use retirement funds in IRA or 401K accounts, which accrue any gains tax-deferred or tax-free.\n\nIf Bitcoin is really a long term investment (which is looking more and more like it by the day) then people will want to invest a portion of their retirement savings (of which there is a very large pool) into it via these methods. It would be as easy as buying any other stock to hold in a diversified portfolio.\n\nA tiny portion of retirement funds flowing into the ETF would eventually deplete the initial offering and the AP's would arb by buying/selling on the exchanges. It will likely bring more volatility to the price, but mostly on the upside in the beginning as short options on the ETF would not be well established at the start.\n\nSome of the excitement comes from the history of the GLD ETF which launched a decade ago. Since Bitcoin is similar to physical Gold, people are banking on COIN having a similar initial success in the ETF. In November of 2004 the GLD ETF launched and achieved $1 Billion in assets after only three days.\n\nA similar opening for COIN might see the initial 200,000 coins bought up quickly (at $300 / BTC this would take $60 million) and then the rest of the demand trickling down through to the exchanges via arbitrage by the AP's.\n\nAs a side note, if you read anything that says the offering price is $20 per share you can ignore the whole article; it is either ignorant or FUD or otherwise. $20 per share equates to $100 / BTC which we are not even close to nearing even in this extended bear market.
