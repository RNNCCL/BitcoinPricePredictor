There could be a good amount of purchasing power widely dispersed, which would attract businesses. The high percentage of funds going directly to the recipients would attract charitable givers. One could even imagine things like verifiable donations being setup in such a system (i.e. 10% of purchase goes towards UBI) which would attract businesses wanting to use that as a promotional tool.\n\nSuch a system isn\'t impossible to imagine, and has a lot of advantages over the current charity/welfare state systems to deal with poverty.': 1}, ('Storing your coins on an online exchange? -- Hacked Exchanges | Ep 4 - BitcoinNe.ws', 4): {}}}
