Demand is tricky because a big part of it is speculation on the value, so there's a complex feedback mechanism involved. At the base of it though, there has to be some fundamental reason for the demand.\n\nBitcoin has limited supply because it's programmed in. It has demand because it's a useful way of transacting and storing value, and it's arguably the most efficient and cheapest such method (in theory at least, i.e. if/when it becomes widely used), and has a bunch of other advantages that national currencies don't have (global, decentralized, sort of anonymous, invisble, etc.).\n\nNational currencies have a sort-of limited supply, but the supply is typically increasing slowly and unpredictably when money keeps getting printed. You might not notice it on the year-to-year basis but over about 10-20 years it adds up. \nDemand for national currencies occurs because the citizens have to pay their taxes in national currency or else they go to jail, and also to a lesser extent their status as legal tender.": 2, 'If the Internet were a country, Bitcoin would be its currency.': 0, 'Well I beg your pardon then, because if you do then you are halfway there!

Chances are, such self-designing and thinking robots will be integrated with (into) humans; the same way we rely on calculators, we will rely on thinking robots to improve our intellect and creativity. But time to made and construct designs will still be limited, and people will pay a premium to get their stuff designed and done first. Resources to build things out of will also always be limited, so people will pay to have specific things built, and others won\'t be able to afford them, even with free robots.\n\n> The Soviet Union wasn\'t Socialist\n\nIt was almost 100% socialist. Private capital ownership was illegal, everything was owned by the public (or rather controlled and distributed by the government), everything created and earned was ultimately taken and controlled by the government, and all property, resources, and even jobs were assigned by central planners. Basically 100% of production was taken and redistributed.\n\n> A world where we don\'t have collaboration and contribution on a society wide level is not a world that will last very long.\n\nYou are confusing socialism with collaboration and contribution. Socialism is just *forced** collaboration and contribution. Capitalism is voluntary collaboration and contribution. Companies collaborate to create more and more complex things (such as multiple tech companies coming together to make an iPhone), and by creating better and cheaper products, contribute to the world and make life easier.\n\n> "experience acclaims as happiest the man who has made the greatest number of people happy".\n\nI\'d say recently that would be people like Steve Jobs, Sergei Brin, Jimmy Wales, Alan Schaaf, Norman Borlaug, and others like that.': 1, 'Does anyone know about shipping things into Venezuela?

A genuine question and one I have never heard a realistic answer too: In a libertarian world how would any law be enforced?\n\n> It starts out that way. Pretty much always it ends up being beholden to the companies that pay to elect its politicians.\n\nI agree here. This just tells me to change the way of governance (which is why I support direct democracy and universal basic income). I support direct democracy because it takes the power away from single interests (as long as people are not gullible enough to drink the horseshit the main stream media spew forth daily) and I support ubi because it allows a true democracy take place by again by taking the power away from capital. If there was a basic income to cover all expenses up to the poverty line many companies would have to change their tactics or they will die because they won't be able to find anyone to do their bidding for all the immoral crap they do all the time. \n\n>Time.\n\nNegligible. It costs a human zero hours to do something so time also goes away. \n\n> Resources\n\nOnce we start mining space resources will be unlimited. \n\n> It was almost 100% socialist.

Even communism also allows for capital ownership on a cottage industry level. Stalin destroyed the communist aspect of soviet Russia by trying to control the whole thing. Communism was only ever meant to control raw materials and essential heavy industries. \n\n>Capitalism is voluntary\n\nIt doesn't feel very voluntary to me.

Your hypothesis supposes that people won't voluntarily support social programs. When you pay taxes you receive services in return (roads, schools, healthcare, law enforcement etc). Without going into the merits of how tax revenues are redistributed which I think we can all agree is currently suboptimal I'm not sure anyone would actually be happier in a situation where no base services are provided on mass for society. A society without governance is completely unsustainable. If government were to disappear then a power vacuum would be created and filled. You just have to look at what is now happening in what was previously Saddam Hussein's Iraq to see that the grass is not always greener even if the grass was not very green to begin with. Collective and social ownership of the basic infrastructure and services necessary to have a cooperative and peaceful society is in the best interests of everyone regardless of whether or not it is acknowledged. \n\nLike you I also believe that crypto-currencies are going to replace fiat currencies and it will be for the best. I am also however aware that capitalism is moving swiftly towards a zero-marginal cost situation through automation. In order for capitalism to work there needs not only be an ability to produce abundance but also a means for people to afford to buy services and products. Automation is breaking the link between economic productivity and an average individuals ability to benefit from said economic output. Within our lifetime it will be possible for one man and a bunch of machines to create and maintain the total infrastructure of a company like Amazon from manufacturing through sale to delivery of a product. This is the efficiency of capitalism at work. The problem which arises in this situation is that no one can buy the products that have been offered because no one has a job and capitalism in it's current form relies on people being in work and earning. This leads us to one of two options. Either we implement programs like a universal basic income or we descend into chaos and hardship. \n\nAs Marx rightly pointed out 200 years ago, all roads eventually lead to socialism. Capitalism eats everything, even itself. I like to look at socialism as the foundations of society (enough to cover the bare minimum so no one has to suffer unnecessarily) covering only the bottom 2 levels of Maslow's pyramid with the rest of the pyramid being down to the individual person.

Socialism based social programs require everyone being forced to contribute, and an authority determining how those contributions be distributed.\n\n> When you pay taxes you receive services in return\n\nWhen you pay for anything, you should be receiving services (or goods) in return. What's special about that? Only difference is that we don't pay taxes, taxes are confiscated from us. No one pays (donates?) taxes voluntarily.\n\n> I'm not sure anyone would actually be happier in a situation where no base services are provided on mass for society.\n\nYour hypothesis is that without tax supported social programs, base services won't be supported. Who provides your base service of telephone and internet? Or gasoline distribution you need to use your car? If base services are wanted and needed, people will pay for them directly.\n\n> If government were to disappear then a power vacuum would be created and filled.\n\nThat depends entirely on why it disappeared, and what the general opinion of society is towards government. In Somalia government fell apart due to clan infighting, where multiple groups wanted power. Now there is no competent government, but the majority of the population still thinks they NEED government, and are ready to get behind any charismatic person willing to take the job. In Iraq the situation is similar, with people thinking they need government, and multiple tribal factions and religious sects vying for that position. If people didn't want to be governed, and there was no way to impose control over people for the purpose of extorting money from them, it would be difficult for power to come into the vacuum. Imagine everyone used bitcoin, and the local armed tribe had no means to know whom you are paying, or how much money you have. The worst they could do is force everyone to live like peasants, while in reality everyone has a lot of money and deals on the black market, and make people move away without being able to stop any of the capital flight. Add things like 3D printing, including for guns, and decentralized anonymous assassination contracts, and those warlords won't know if the guys they are planning to extort are armed to the teeth, or if they may end up with a huge crowdfunded bounty on their heads if they piss off too many people.\n\n> Collective and social ownership of the basic infrastructure and services necessary to have a cooperative and peaceful society\n\nCollective and social ownership of the basic infrastructure and services IS NOT necessary to have a cooperative and peaceful society. But collective and social ownership of basic infrastructure and services HAS proven again and again throughout history to lead to corrupt and violent society. From Soviet Union, to Cuba, to the situation in Venezuela, Ecuador, Greece, and even Russia now. I would say respect for other people's property, rights, and treating people with dignity is in the best interest of everyone, not using threats to take from some who are less needy, and giving that to those who are more needy, after taking a huge cut to the privileged in your own group.\n\n> Within our lifetime it will be possible for one man and a bunch of machines to create and maintain the total infrastructure of a company like Amazon from manufacturing through sale to delivery of a product.\n\nThis pretty much happened with farming, and we used to have about 98% of our population be employed in farming. Note that 98% of our population is not unemployed. We will find something else to do.\n\n> In order for capitalism to work there needs not only be an ability to produce abundance but also a means for people to afford to buy services and products. ... The problem which arises in this situation is that no one can buy the products that have been offered because no one has a job\n\nThere won't be such a problem, because no one will MAKE products that can't be bought. Capitalism will continue to work, because the only products that will be produced are those that people can still afford. Even if that means that an item that used to employ 20 people to produce was sold for $200, and now takes one person to produce, and gets sold for $5. Prices will go down, as will investments in expensive automation equipment, especially if you could pay a laborer less than what it costs to take out a loan to buy a robot. Everything will find a balance just as it always had. The only two problems that will really happen is that minimum wage laws will keep making it cheaper to buy expensive robots instead of hire cheaper workers, and same laws will keep businesses hiring lower income people for simpler projects, leading to continued increases in unemployed people (actual unemployment, not people who are actively looking for work and can't find it). Low skilled laborers will also be a huge problem, since no one will be able to hire them, and after so many years they won't have the skills and possibly drive to look for work or be creative in earning money.\n\n> This leads us to one of two options. Either we implement programs like a universal basic income or we descend into chaos and hardship.\n\nI guess it'll be chaos, since, as I said, basic income relies on that money coming from somewhere, and it won't be inflation or taxation. Maybe property taxes, but that has it's own issues. Especially since poor people still have to live on a property and pay taxes, so they'll essentially be funding their own basic income through higher rent.\n\n> As Marx rightly pointed\n\nMarx didn't point anything out rightly. He had no formal economic education whatsoever, was a leech on his family, living off of loans and being a miserable person to be around. He contributed nothing to the economy, did a lot of arm-chair economics, and wrote a big whine about how the world is being unfair to him, which became his manifesto. Everything he predicted ended up being false, including the idea that all roads lead to socialism. Governments that tax and use those taxes to give out handouts lead to socialism, and then eventual collapse (Soviet Union and such). It's pretty much inevitable when the minority produces a great deal, the majority has a great deal of political power, and there exists a system where that majority can keep voting to take more and more for themselves.\n\nBut, again, this is all irrelevant, since bitcoin will make the means of paying for socialism extremely more difficult if not impossible.

Yes, security was absolutely posited as one of several key factors, but the niqab legislation did NOT arise from an acute security threat, and security was also not the only rationalization, on the contrary.\n\nI'll cautiously say that a growing, normalized, salonf\xc3\xa4hig islamophobia (driven by a post 9/11 neoliberal outlook on the world) was the origin of such policies. If we didn't have Huntington's 'clash of civilizations' type thinking going on this would never have been an issue.\n\nLet's look at the numbers: it's about 1500 or so women for a pop of 65m.

He was very clear when he said 'the law is to protect women from being forced to cover their faces and to uphold France's secular values', he didn't say it was because of a security issue.\n\nAnd look at the fines: a woman wearing it is charged $195. A man forcing a woman to wear it, I'm not kidding this is true, is charged $39k. Obviously these fines aren't as such because veils are a security issue. They're such because they're a religious and cultural directive based on the (partially true, partially wrong) notion that Muslim men use it to subjugate women.\n\nThe reality is that France has subjugated its women. How can one force a particular dress. Could we force a woman not to cover up her breasts in the same way? No that would be ridiculous. Why? Because we consider breasts to be private parts, intimate parts. But when 0.002% of the population considers the face to be a private and intimate part, we force them to reveal it, and otherwise force them to stay at home as many women do now. It's absolute nonsense. Hamza Yusuf puts it quite well:\n\n> Most women who wear it believe they are following God\xe2\x80\x99s injunction and not their husband\xe2\x80\x99s. French laicism seems as fundamentalist as the very religious fanatics it wants to keep out. On a trip to France a few years ago, I was shocked to see pornography openly displayed on the streets in large advertisements. How odd that to unveil a woman for all to gape at is civilized, but for her to cover up to ward off gazes is a crime... While the French Prime Minister sees no problem with exposing in public places a woman\xe2\x80\x99s glorious nakedness, he is oddly and quite rabidly disturbed by allowing others to cover it up. The sooner secular nations learn to allow people of faith to live their lives in peace, the sooner peace will flourish.\n\nNow I'm agnostic myself, believe in secular society and mock religion in a private setting every now and then.

These machines are not ATMs in the traditional sense that you are simply withdrawing money from a bank account, but rather more akin to a currency conversion window (like a money changer at the airport), or a physical FOREX exchange. You are converting cash into Bitcoin, or vice versa. \n\nThere are 2 considerations that are taken into account for costs when buying/selling BTC on a BitcoinATM:\n\n1. You will have a spread, which is common for any currency conversion. This means you will have a buy price that is higher than the market rate, and a sell price below market. This is done to offset slippage, volatility and other risks the operator of the machine takes on to provide Bitcoin inventory on the machine. \n\n2. As well, there will be a transaction fee associated with the buying and selling. These fees, as mentioned elsewhere avg 5.8%, which may seem high at first glance, but understand that the operator is providing a machine that you can simply walk up to to buy and sell Bitcoin immediately. They have all the expenses of a traditional ATM, but a fraction of the volume to cover expenses and ROI. \n\nAs Bitcoin matures, there could end up being lower volatility which would equate to tighter spreads. More transactions per machine will decrease fees. Today the machines operate in a low volume / high volatility space, meaning a lot of risk to an operator.

(someone can correct me on the last part if I'm wrong, but this was my understanding)\n\nIf you really wanted to be secure with your cold storage when you go to spend it, you could load it into an offline device, and do offline transaction signing in an attempt to keep the keys protected, but that isn't as convenient as a Trezor.  You still risk that device being being compromised or connected to the internet by user error as well.\n\nTrezor is not as convenient as a hot wallet, but much more secure. It's way more convenient to spend from than cold storage, and it's arguably as secure as encrypted cold storage, but I'll leave that last part to others with more knowledge to debate.\n": 2, 'Paper is fine for storage but I want a method of cold storage which allows me to sign transactions without ever exposing my keys to a hot device, paper is a needless complication in that regard.\n\n Armoury running offline on an encrypted old netbook fits the bill at the moment but a far more simple and elegant dedicated product solution is possible using a simple qr reader/display to cross the air gap.

With a BTChip, it is also possible to do so but it takes more work. The chip does a 2FA scheme where it powers off, and on the next device it is plugged into, it will behave as a keyboard only. It then types the transaction details into the computer along with a PIN code, and shuts off again. It then must be unplugged and plugged back in to the original machine. That PIN code must then be used to finalize the transaction.\n\nWhat I like about the BTChip is it's size (I can fit 10 of them in my wallet), price (I can own 10 without breaking the bank), and programmability.

Why do banks need insurance? Why is it *legally* mandated? Clearly it's because too many banks failed or absconded with depositors funds too spectacularly. The government was forced to step in, and now we are all forced to have insurance on our accounts. As with many aspects of modern banking, the costs associated with this insurance are well hidden from depositors. Banks pay the insurance premiums, but do you think bankers are reaching down in their own pockets to pay for *your* insurance? Not a chance. The premiums come from bank fees and reduced interest payments to depositors. Every bank user is paying for this insurance, whether they ever need to take advantage of it or not.  \n\nSo is this is a situation we want to emulate with Bitcoin? I don't. There have been spectacular failures around Bitcoin, like the Mt.Gox collapse. These have all been the result of users making the choice to give up control of their own funds. They elected to trust a centralized organization, and much like in the early days of banking, it went wrong too often. I know this could happen to me if I make the wrong choice, but I choose to accept this risk as I prefer the overall freedom that Bitcoin offers. But since the world is not filled with only good, ethical and moral people, this freedom comes with immense responsibility.  \n\nBitcoin the currency is really closer to cash money than it is to figures in a bank's ledger or amounts on a credit card balance. Bank-like services can easily be built on top of bitcoin just like they have been with cash. In fact, some similar services already exist. If people decide they need this, and there is enough demand to amount to financial reward for service providers, solutions will develop. But with Bitcoin, these will always just be *options*, not *required*. Personally, I'd never use a Bitcoin bank because Bitcoin already gives me the tools necessary to keep my funds secure.
