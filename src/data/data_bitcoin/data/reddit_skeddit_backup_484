You misunderstood my optimism for "talking my own book" trying to pump it up. \n\nI see how you could read it that way,  and I should have said it different........\n\nLet me try again; \n\nWith honest money hard working Americans and my family in the third world will have the chance to work hard and reap the benefits of a real "Money" that is honest and a true store of value. \n\nThis honesty alone is enough to turn the tide and make America great again, and not just America, but all countries struggling with this theafdom.  \n\nCompared to our dishonest money, the tax problem, war problem, drug problem, global warming, and rampaging zombies are tiny little details.  \n\nHonest money is the foundation for prosperity.  Without honest money the equation to flourish can not be achieved. \n\nSo strike from the record my comment about going to 10,000 and replace it with this; \n\nI can\'t wait for my kids to work hard and reap what they sew.   It will be a glorious time to see the hard work take hold and savings compound to the point where we can all have a higher quality of life........this starts with honest money and ends with said honest money gaining a foot hold,  some will see this as a rise in price, \n\nBut others will see this as manifest fuckin destiny.   \n\nWe can work, save, and invest and reap what we sew.  \n\nBut not in a system where lawyers and insurance and bankers make all the money.  The production of real goods and services are the foundation and true wealth is finding your place in that supply chain. \n\nSorry for the rant but that\'s my 2 cents.  \n\nI want America back.   I want to be proud.  I want to see a movie where at some foreign checkout some A-hole says "I\'m an American" and suddenly everything is ok.  \n\nI want to eat a .99 cent whopper and whistle the tune to Andy freaking Griffith and have kids know what it is.  \n\nI want to vote for a president that didn\'t just win the "I\'m the slickest asshole in the room" competition. \n\nI want to take my kids on a road trip.  For weeks. And see the national parks.  This was a birth right just 30 years ago. \n\nBut I can\'t because I am treading water paying taxes, interest, and insurance premiums that total more than 50% of my income. \n\nMy savings is wasted, my 401k is Shiite, and social security will never make it long enough to give me a retirement. \n\nSo I didn\'t mean to say "to the moon 10,000"  to pump my own investment\n\nI was simply saying that with honest money maybe I got a chance, and earning 1,000 dollars today is nothing compared to earning 2 bitcoins because they are real money.  \n\nHonest money.  \n\nAgain, glass half full and I don\'t care what the price is.   Bitcoin is real money and I would rather work for it than fiat. \n\nSo that should give you a few more things to complain about ;) \n\nSomething something something and you get the horns.  \n\nHappy day.
