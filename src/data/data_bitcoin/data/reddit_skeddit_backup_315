That is exactly what we are seeing happen now with XT/BIP101. Whether people call THAT bitcoin is semantics. Everything is fluid and dynamic. If someone wants to make a bigger leap and invent a new 'coin' that has all kinds of great new properties, and THAT becomes the most popular crypto currency, then great!\n\nBitcoin evolves to best serve greatest number of people.

What about NYC?': 1}, ('Lightning network: Can I spend 1 Bitcoin I receive on LN from Alice to pay Bob without closing the channels?', 9): {'I think that what might be confusing here is that "the network" is not holding coins -- the endpoints of individual channels are. So you and I enter into a micropayment channel contract, where you put in 5 btc and I put in 5 btc. Sometimes I want to make a payment through you and so I send some of my 5 btc to you, and other times you want to make a payment through me and so move the channel in the other direction. We could collectively move thousands of bitcoins through this channel by moving the _same_ bitcoins back and forth again. So if 1,000 btc is transacted in aggregate across 10,000 0.1 btc transactions, to and fro, then so long as those payments are not all in the same direction then the network doesn\'t need 1,000 btc to track it. It just needs the maximum differential at any point in time.\n\nThink about it like how a bank account operates. Let\'s say you get paid $1k per week. Let\'s pretend that this is done with a micropayment channel between you and the bank, which operates a lightning hub. So every week, on payday, your employer sends your money a couple of hops through the network to your bank, which then pushes $1k in your direction. The first time this happens you have $1k, and the bank has $4k remaining in the channel. This continues to happen each week on payday.\n\nBut you\'ve got some expenses too -- not just morning coffee and those 2hr lunches at the pub, but groceries and gas, insurance, rent, utilities, etc. Each time an expense or bill comes up _you_ send money to its destination through your bank, crediting back the money you got paid on last week\'s payday.\n\nSo a lightning channels from the perspective of one endpoint is kinda like a bank account, one that is not allowed to go negative or exceed a maximum value. So what happens when you are a good worker bee and squirrel away money, living below your means? Well your channel fills up, and eventually you end up with $5k and the bank holding $0, _which means your paycheck is no longer able to clear_. The simplest solution is to settle the channel (broadcast to the block chain), either claiming your funds or feeding them forward into a new rollover channel with higher limits (e.g. bank puts in another $5k for for a $10k channel with you and the bank starting out each holding half).\n\nMore advanced possibilities exist, however. If you have multiple channels with different banks, your paycheck would be routed to wherever "account" had enough free capacity to receive it, or even be split among accounts (channels) automatically. You\'d reduce fees in that situation by having your choice of which bank (hub) to use, perhaps with differing fees as a result of current conditions. You\'d maybe even earn "interest" by the bank paying you to move funds from one account to another in order to help them rebalance their obligations. This is analogous to an airline paying you to be flexible and take another flight because they\'re overbooked. It\'s a bit hand-wavy right now and we really need to see it deployed in practice to fully understand how it would develop.\n\nBut what happens when you want to make a payment larger than your channel balances? If it\'s a regular thing you negotiate a larger channel with your favorite hub(s) and use that. But what about a one-off thing like closing escrow on a house, buying a car with cash, or a super large tax bill? Those you fall back to using bitcoin directly.': 6, "Does each hub have to have sufficient reserves to cover the payment? So for example if I wanted to send my friend 1BTC and there were 5 'hops' between us, would the lightning network as a whole need 5BTC in reserve to make that payment happen?": 2, 'You could open a channel using no funds, but other party puts down 2BTC, and over time they send you the whole amount. You can just think of it as directional liquidity. ': 8, "Yes. That's one of the things that makes it unclear how lightning will scale for transactions larger than e.g. morning coffee and micro transactions. But if the only thing that hit the chain were big purchases and channel setup / teardown, that would still be a huge boon for scalability.": 3, "Potentially, yes. That's the point of Lightning Network.

That's interesting. Does the lighting network need to hold this 'reserve' until the transactions are settled on the blockchain? So if I leave a channel open for 1 month, and make 30 transactions for my morning frappachinos at 0.1BTC each, which involve 3 hubs, does the network have to hold 90BTC in reserve for me to do that?": 1, 'Yes but the hub needs to have previously deposited at minimum the difference on their side of the channel for you to receive the 2 BTC payment.': 4, "That's for taking the time to respond in such detail. I was away when I read your response so sorry it's take a while for me to acknowledge it.\n\nI can see the potential of Lightning Networks, but would you agree they only cover a sub-set of the use cases for Bitcoin? They sound almost like a traditional banking system, but without the need for trust, and without the possibility of a fractional reserve (or in fact the opposite of a fractional reserve, where the bank has to hold more reserves than its customers are owed).\n\nThinking this through a bit more - lets say a Lightning Hub has to have 1 million worth of collateral held to cover the payments it processes. The fee it would have to charge for processing payments would need to at least equal what it could earn from using that collateral elsewhere (earning interest in a traditional bank, investing elsewhere etc) plus the costs of operating the hub? I'm not sure what the figures would be, but does that sound like a reasonable (although very simplified) assumption of how pricing for transactions on the lighting network may be determined?": 1, "Another stupid question:\n\nLet's say you have commit 1BTC in LN spend part of it and recueve 2BTC can you end up with more BTC that you have commited at the beginning?": 3, 'I would need to have credited my LN "wallet" with 2BTC first before to be able reach 2BTC balance is it correct?\n\nDoes-it mean I would not be able to accept 2BTC payment?

Seriously, tell me, what innovative ideas are absolutely impossible because of a $40k barrier? See, my bank has had to comply with regulations for decades and they\'ve still managed to do quite a bit of innovating so your argument really holds no water, it\'s just incessant whining that, despite emulating banks, Bitcoin companies shouldn\'t have to play by the same rules and apparently paying $40k means you can\'t have a single idea\n': -1, "Coin_trader files SAR's on its customers, avoid.

If so many people try to use bitcoin to buy a cup of coffee that it floods the blockchain we will all be millionaires.': 3, 'Here is the whole article:"The blockchain is a distributed ledger \xe2\x80\x93 a shared digital record of asset ownership \xe2\x80\x93 that many believe could increase efficiency and reduce costs in financial markets.\n\nFinancial News spoke to Fredrik Voss, vice president and head of blockchain strategy at Nasdaq, about how the deployment is progressing and what other blockchain projects are in the works at the US-based exchange group.\n\n\nFinancial News: When did Nasdaq start looking at blockchain and what have you been up to since then?\n\nFredrik Voss: Our history in the space started about 18-24 months ago before I was appointed to my current role. Since then we have done a lot of work in this space. We are intrigued by the potential efficiencies that the technology can bring to financial markets. We have quite a few perspectives in this. The first use is going to be our Nasdaq Private Market initiative.\n\nHave you scheduled a launch date?\n\nRELATED\nUBS taps global fintech start-ups for ideas\nThe big banks can teach disrupters a thing or two\nQ&A: Inside BNP Paribas\' blockchain plans\nBlockchain gets Nasdaq test\nFintech 40: We\'ve seen the future and it\'s blockchain\nNasdaq\'s blockchain plans take shape\nWe are aiming for an initial launch later this year. The project is making good progress. We have met various milestones internally when it comes to proof of concept and prototypes. We are not quite there yet, but we hope to communicate another milestone publicly in a relatively short time.\n\nAre you looking at other uses?\n\nThe obvious benefit of the distributed ledger is evident in financial markets for things like settlement and custody, to create efficiency in back-office processes. But for Nasdaq there is also a sort of two dimensional opportunity. One is for our own settlement and clearing activities, as we do in Europe. But the other opportunity \xe2\x80\x93 being the world\'s largest supplier of exchange, clearing house and depository technology \xe2\x80\x93 is to incorporate this capability in our offering. This is obviously also a potential opportunity for Nasdaq.\n\nSo you are essentially looking at selling distributed ledger-based systems to your technology clients such as clearing houses?\n\nYes, we can enhance those offerings with blockchain capabilities.\n\nWhen do you think we will see applications of blockchain-based trading and settlement of real-world financial instruments?\n\nWe are looking at commercial uses and identifying what real product or offering will follow the Nasdaq Private Market [project]. If, as we hope, the NPM initiative works, then we could definitely see our second application coming out sometime in the next year. Of course whether you choose a large initiative or a confined smaller initiative depends on acceptance by clients.\n\nHow can the blockchain be useful for market surveillance?\n\nWe think it will be possible to create various levels of transparency into what is going on in the ledger. So if you have transactions recorded on a distributed ledger, we will be able to keep transactions anonymous for parties for which they should be anonymous \xe2\x80\x93 for example, only publishing price and time of a settlement of a transaction \xe2\x80\x93 but at the same possibly give tools to a market surveillance department so that they will be able to see more data. Also possibly giving more data to regulators in markets where that is a regulatory requirement to do so and doing that without having to replicate the database of transactions multiple times.\n\nToday we are building all these huge trade repositories around the world \xe2\x80\x93 in Europe we have a derivatives one, for example \xe2\x80\x93 but if we could actually use the original ledger, the original source of the transactions to allow various participants to see various levels of detail on a transaction, it could be a much more efficient way for everybody involved to go about their business. I\xe2\x80\x99m not saying that we have a finished application in that but that is an intriguing possibility.\n\nWhat are some of the things the blockchain isn\'t suited for yet?\n\nFor exchanges where you have very high \xe2\x80\x93 millions of quotes in a second \xe2\x80\x93 recording those quotes into an immutable ledger would be interesting. But we are not so sure that the blockchain, at least not currently, has the capability to accommodate those kinds of volumes and speed requirements that you need for those purposes.\n\nWhat are the other non-technical challenges of adoption? This could be really disruptive, potentially reducing the need for clearing houses and custodians. Does that create some friction?\n\nTo change the world you need to get acceptance of the new world. This starts with an attitude change, and one way of changing attitudes is to demonstrate that the new world is better than the old world. And that happens by demonstrating the technology works in real life, that it creates benefits, that it becomes cheaper and more efficient than the existing system. That is one process that we need to go through before it can be deployed on a really large scale.\n\nThe other is the transition from a current market and technological set-up to the new set-up, and you need to have a well-thought through way of transitioning, because you want to minimise the time when you run parallel systems, as that tends to be costly.\n\nThen, of course, for every single deployment that community needs to agree on how we are going to go about this transition. We are very used to that. The market technology division deploys exchange, clearing and settlement technology around the world and a key part of all those projects are transitions because usually we replace a legacy system and it involves many parties.\n\nBut in the case of distributed ledgers it could go beyond replacing a clearing house\'s legacy system to actually replacing the clearing house itself with the technology. The paradigm shift seems a lot bigger.\n\nThere are a lot of post-trade processes that are actually there not because of how the technology works today. You have investor protection and you have consumer protection, for example. A new technology doesn\'t mean that suddenly every need you have to satisfy just goes away. There will still be a lot of old processes going on because they are in demand, not for technology reasons but for other regulatory or even social requirements.\n\nSo the role of a custodian or clearing house will adapt rather than those institutions fully being replaced?\n\nWe think so. But it remains to be seen. The potential that distributed ledgers bring is a true innovation of a dimension that has historically rarely been this relevant for financial markets. It remains to be proven, of course, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t eliminate all the activities that go on today. Many of these will still have to be performed by someone in the community. But it can certainly shake up who does what.\n\nAre there sufficient people with blockchain knowledge and skills out there to support wider deployment?\n\nFor our current needs, we are very satisfied. But if you take a longer-term perspective and you start to see a world that utilises this technology more and more, then of course we are going to need engineers and developers that are well-versed in the technology. But you also need knowledge on the business side. The roles of certain market participants in the future may not disappear, but they will look different. If you continuously try to do things the way you have done them in the past, then you might have a great challenge to survive"': 4, '[removed]': -1, 'I hit a paywall when i clicked the link': 4, 'BitcoinXT': -2, '*you\'re\n\n*"Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and to remove all doubt."*': 1, 'Watch out for eth nasdaq \n': 1, "Haha your a sad little man.

Which is exactly why for blockchain trading in the future we'll be using centralized trade engine to match buyer and seller and then once trade us executed offload the value of it onto the blockchain to transaction. Much like we currently do where trades occur in real time on Bitstamp and users then withdraw the transact  on the blockchain to hold the asset independent of a central authority.

The capital requirements of the hubs is concerning to me, too. The locked up funds problem is concerning as well, especially if the underlying asset (Bitcoin) is too volatile. So LN requires a stable-ish, well-distributed, well-powered Bitcoin that is running under the network. Even if it doesn't provide a scaling advantage over vanilla bitcoin, it will provide a few other advantages (the ones that it shares with micropayment channels) that I think will help bootstrap it. I don't think we'll know enough until it closer to implementation and I'm also not sure we have all the clever tricks (and gotchas) figured out yet.

Though this is far more amusing...': 4, 'Yup, sounds like a shit show.': 0, 'Side chains are an interesting concept that came out of a few problems that keep occurring in the cryptocurrency space. Let me start with a background on altcoins.\n\nAltcoins have good and bad things associated with them. For the most part, they are clones of Bitcoin with almost no new innovation associated with them. Early cryptocurrency history is littered with the corpses of hundreds of them. Many were little more than pump-and-dumps that the developer cashed out of early leaving a lot of users holding a bunch of worthless coins. Some of them the devs just kind of moved on to other projects and let them dwindle away. Occasionally one would come along with something a little bit different and they survived. For example Tenebrix used a different hash function, though configured wrong, that was a little harder to get running on GPUs and ASICs. Another coin has a really cute mascot. Another uses a different signature scheme that makes it more private. Another is the best thing since sliced bread (according to the developers). Another is Turing complete and apparently will become a benevolent Skynet.\n\nThe problem with all these developments is that they may take network effect from Bitcoin (the one true cryptocurrency, praise be to Satoshi). They probably won\'t overcome Bitcoin, but it causes onlookers (and potential users) to ask, "Why would I buy Bitcoin, when X-coin is very similar and looks better in a lot of ways? Actually, why would I buy any cryptocurrency at all when they can be made cloned infinitely and therefore they are all worthless. Maybe I should wait a little longer so I know which one will be the winner. Screw this! I\'ll just buy some more candy crush gold." Additionally, for a novice it was really hard to evaluate if a claim by some shady developer was actually true or not.\n\nSidechains address this by saying: what if I made it possible to trade Bitcoin for an Altcoin, but be pretty sure that I can get my Bitcoin back after I\'m done "trying out" that coin? It works by "pegging" the currency to Bitcoin in a predictable way. Most common peg would be a two way peg (1 bitcoin = 1 sidechain coin or some other fixed ratio). Other pegs could exist, but it\'s hard to think of an actual use for them. A side chain may have any number of benefits over Bitcoin, for example it could have a special use case (small signatures) or a different privacy method, etc. It could be a test bed for a new cryptographic concept that\'s too new to put into Bitcoin, but may be better if the cryptography works out in the future. It makes it easier for developers to test their concepts "live" rather than having to "boot" up a new currency (altcoin) to support it.\n\nThere\'s a few disadvantages - right now there\'s no way to use the real Bitcoin to actually make a two-way peg in a that was trustless. The "code" isn\'t in Bitcoin to do it yet, although there\'s some hand wavy ways to get it done. IMO, in order for it to work the two-way peg crypto has to be pretty rock solid. \n\nThere\'s all sorts of weird things that could happen and it\'s really very possible that the best applications haven\'t even been thought of. For example, let\'s say there turns out to be some trustless, decentralized consensus method that turns out to be infinitely better than POW/Blockchains which is discovered in the future. Let\'s say it\'s based on some sort of quantum phenomenon that makes it easy to enforce a consensus. All of a sudden, all the POW mining and other shit we have been doing turns out to be useless work. How would we translate the economy over into the new system... conceivably you could use a side chain to migrate everyone\'s value over to the new system (essentially abandoning the once innovative Bitcoin). I expect this will happen about the time we get our first Dyson sphere up and running. ;)': 2, 'Another disadvantage of the payment channel is that neither the sender nor the receiver can move the locked-up bitcoins until the channel is closed by the receiver, or the specified timeout expires.  Even if no micropayments were sent. \n\nAnother problem is that the receiver loses all the money paid, if he fails to close the channel before the deadline -- say, because his machine crashed, or the sender unleashed a DDoS attack, or his closing transaction was delayed because of a  traffic jam or spam attack on the bitcoin network.\n\nBecause of the above, if the sender intends to play a videogame for N minutes at P bitcoins per minute, he must lock N x P bitcoins for (N + 30) minutes or more.  \n\nIf, at the end of the N minutes, he decides to continue playing, he must issue another blockchain operation to lock more coins, and wait 10 min on average for it to confirm, before resuming the play.  (Or maybe wait a few hours, if the network is suffering a traffic jam or spam attack.)\n\nAlso the receiver can cash in the last payment without delivering the corresponding service (the last minute of the video, say).

However, when payment channels are used in the LN, I wonder whether the hub can steal or lose the last payment of a consumer, without passing it on to the merchant.)

I do have a lot a hope for it though.\n\nI agree with Poon on that particular prototype not being LN in the truest sense. I haven't looked into the backend of streamium, so I'm not 100% sure they've implemented payment channels completely yet. The fact that I've heard a few streamers say their money disappeared due to a browser session bug means their implementation needs work.": 2, '(Disclaimer: I\'m not a lightning or sidechain developer... I\'ve read through the papers, but it\'s been a while, so take what you read with a grain of salt. Go to the primary sources for more in-depth discussion. For brevity and technical reasons, I\'ve simplified a lot of the discussion. I\'m also particularly biased in that I think both ideas are likely to be *really* good ideas, so my criticism is probably a little light. A lot of that depends on my trust in  figures that have put forth the ideas).\n\nLN and sidechains are really two different concepts.\n\nWe will start with LN. There\'s a thing called a micropayment channel which you could fill pages with regarding the details, but think of it like this: You have a certain amount of Bitcoin that you\'re willing to devote to a purchase... say a streaming video. You know you\'ll spend less than $20 on the video, but you don\'t know exactly when you\'ll stop the video. You construct a special transaction that you can adjust as you watch the video for as long as you watch it. If the content provider notices that you stop "streaming" your bitcoin to them, then they will stop "streaming" the video to you. Once the transaction is complete, you and the other party stop the transaction and you get your remaining Bitcoin back.\n\nThere\'s a few benefits to a micropayment channel:\n\n* Once the initial transaction is setup, all the "streaming" which occurs is off the blockchain, you don\'t have to repeatedly "write" to the blockchain as if you were just making a whole bunch of 3 cent payments over and over.\n* The exchange of Bitcoin occurs off the network, people won\'t know how much you\'ll spend until the transaction is complete and the channel is closed because after the initial transaction, you and the other party will be directly dealing with each other (but in a trustless manner).\n* Once the channel is "open" they\'re is no delay for confirmation and it remains trustless.\n\nA couple cons: \n\n* You have to open a transaction every time with every service that you\'re wanting to use... meaning you have to have a lot of upfront capital if you want multiple channels open.\n* You still have to wait for the initial transaction to hit the blockchain before you and other party can trust each other.\n\nSo the LN is an extension of a micropayment channel, but instead of connecting to desired end party, you connect to a hub who may connect to another hub that may connect to the desired end party. It\'s important to note that hubs cannot steal your money in much the way that in a micropayment channel can\'t steal more than you already gave them. So you can think of the LN as a internet of micropayment channels. This has a few advantages for you and the hubs.\n\n* You don\'t have to have as much upfront equity, you can use your funds for a variety of things (video, gas, electricity) and it still comes from the same "source."\n* It remains trustless for the most part, hubs can refuse to accept your payment, or stop accepting your "stream," but they cannot take your money that you haven\'t already spent.\n\nDisadvantages:\n\n* There\'s a lot. The LN doesn\'t actually exist yet, although there is a pretty clear way forward and most agree there aren\'t any glaringly impossibly bad things to implement.\n* The hubs will need to have capital available (and quite a lot depending on how long they keep their channels open) and that capital will have to be "hot" (can\'t be stored offline), which makes the hubs vulnerable to hacking events.\n* It will have to use some special software for it and the end points will be something other than Bitcoin addresses (I think) - perhaps using a name service of some sort or a different type of identifier. It\'ll probably be a bit more complicated at least initially, but eventually the user interface should be very good (or at least comparable to Bitcoin, which I would still consider kinda OK).\n* You\'ll be paying "fees" to use these hubs.\n* A function LN requires a functioning Bitcoin network. If Bitcoin breaks, LN breaks.\n\nSo that\'s the LN.

That means that consumers will have to lock up enough coins to cover their payments for several months; and will not be able to close their "accounts" (payment channels to hubs) until that deadline, unless the hub agrees to close the channel.  This cannot be a frequent occurrence, otherwise the 100:1 ratio will not be maintained; therefore the hub must charge a high fee for that.\n\nIf a hub connects 1000 consumers to 100 merchants, and each consumer locks 10 BTC for 3 months in the upgoing channels, the hub may eventually have to send 10\'000 BTC to the merchants, which they will want to collect well before the 3 months.  How much should the hub lock up in the downchannel to each merchant?  The hub cannot use the customers\' coins, which are locked; so the hub will have to use its own coins to pay the merchants, or borrow from some "bitcoin bank". \n\nThe LN cannot start small and grow by attracting clients gradually.  If only 50% of the bitcoiners are LN users, they will have to close and reopen channels all the time in order to pay non-users.  Then the LN will generate *more* on-chain traffic than those people would generate if they did not use the LN at all.\n\nHubs will be large and immobile, therefore they will have to be licensed and comply with AML/KYC rules.  Merchants will not want to create and manage payment channels directly from consumers, so each merchant will receive payments only through one or two specific hubs.   If the hub that Starbucks uses thinks that you are overweight, it may block the payment for your frappucino.

Bitcoin adjusts to demand by holding the number of units constant, but varying their value per unit.\n\nThis is so true, very well said. The fiat system wasn\'t even theoretically capable of adopting the model used by Bitcoin because money had very finite divisibility. And, in the pre-digital age, there was no way for people to instantly know real-time adjustments in value per unit. Consequently, this system of each unit having a constant value is the only system anyone has ever known, making it natural that people would assume there is a flaw in the new system used by Bitcoin where the value of the unit adjusts while the supply remains constant.\n\nIncidentally, it is precisely because Bitcoin can function as a speculative asset that adoption occurs, naturally, over time without the need for the token to be backed by some other asset or without the need for the government to mandate its use.\n\nThat is, the traditional way of creating the network effect for a new currency was either to A) back that currency with a more cumbersome, but more reliable, money, or B) mandate the use of the currency by law. \n\nIn the case of A, users benefiting from the advantage of using paper notes, for example, could also exchange those paper notes at any time for the amount of gold indicated on the note. They gain the convenience of paper, but the reliability of gold, which at the time was considered real money, and this caused more and more people to use paper instead of gold. \n\nIn the case of B, government used laws to force the population into using a currency, thus bypassing the need to back the currency with anything in order to sustain the network effect. You no longer needed to know that your paper could be exchanged for real money, because the government in effect made the paper itself the only real money.  \n\nBut with Bitcoin, precisely because the supply is fixed and the demand is met by increases in value, neither solution A nor B is required to achieve the network effect over time.
