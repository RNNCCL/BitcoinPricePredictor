If used properly, these smart contracts eliminate a big chunk of risk that has previously always been inherent in the financial system, and it also reduces the (apparent) need for government. Both of these changes are very positive for both individuals and society as a whole.\n\nMy favorite Satoshi quote:\n\n> The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.\n>\n> A generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.\n>\n> It's time we had the same thing for money.

In my opinion it was probably early because it was based on the simple observation that the majority of people left their money in banks for security and rarely requested 100% withdraws.  Based on that simple fact, the bankers took it upon themselves to the loan it out.  Once a bank no longer holds 100% reserves they are acting as fractional banking.   The question then becomes, how much should they loan out.\n\nThe interesting thing about this is that they now have the power to fund the projects they want to fund.   Bankers vet the validity of each loan based on risk and return.  With this power, they became the gatekeepers of capital.   You had to meet their expectations to get money for your business and idea.  If they didn't like it or didn't like you, then you were SOL.   \n\nTake at look at the Rothschild family.  They were the first banking dynasty which was born in the 1700s.  Their lifestyle and history is heavily documented.  So I'm not talking conspiracy here it's just really cool to learn about the family that setup Banks for most of the governments that are still present today in Europe.  They found that lending to governments was way less risky than lending to people.  Governments were very low risk borrowers and would rarely default on their loans because they have tax payers.\n\nThe Rothschilds are the perfect example of how much wealth banks acquire by being in control of the money supply and running fractional reserves.  Their name is spread all over the modern world.\n\nI mention this history, because Bitcoin is the first thing to challenge this model in over 500 years.  \n\nThis model of Bank > Debt > Government > Taxes > People.   \n\nI'm not saying Bitcoin is going to change this system over night or anything.  I'm simply stating the fact that Bitcoin's fixed money supply puts an end to instant wealth creation at a flick of a pen.

Bitcoin is going to empower the middle class once more.", 24): {'[deleted]': 1, 'Deflation is not inherently dangerous, it is just inherently dangerous for our modern fiat monetary system. The reason for this is that the modern monetary system depends on continual lending to stay afloat. Modern money is created through bank lending, but this means that almost all of the money in existence is actually just rented money, which people and institutions owe interest on. That is to say, there isn\'t enough money in existence to pay back all of the debts that are owed. So in order to keep this system from collapsing, more money needs to be continually created at an equal or faster rate than debts are being repaid, and since money is created through lending, the entire system depends on the continual creation of new loans to survive.\n\nIf deflation were to occur in the context of a modern fiat system, however, no one would be able to repay their loans. The reason is easy to imagine using Bitcoin. Imagine you took a loan of 30 BTC today, that is roughly $6000, but say by the time you are due to repay the loan the price has risen to $10,000 per bitcoin. Now you actually owe $300,000. There is no way you could repay that, and would thus default on the loan. What is more, you would never take another loan of BTC again.\n\nIf deflation were to occur with fiat money, not only would people refuse to take any more loans, but they would likely not be able to repay their existing loans either. When you consider the massive amounts of debt in existence you can imagine the results would make the housing market crash look like a minor bump in the road. \n\nThe Fed, using QE, has pumped around four trillion dollars into the economy in a desperate attempt to stave off deflation, afaik that is more money printed than in history, and yet the rate of inflation continues to drop. When you consider that QE has "ended" and oil prices are driving inflation even lower . . . you can see where this is going.

Was a big news, here on reddit.": 7, 'yeah you have to give your password to blockchain.info to prove you had that address with them to get the money back, then I suggest you move to use a better wallet where the devs know what they are doing and avoid the clowns at blockchain.info': 5, 'ah, thank god! any suggestions?': 2, "Johan? sorry, haven't used this SR before and am not very knowledgeable when it comes to btc. I will do from now on, so angry! ": 1, "Yeah, I guessed from the others' responses :( \n\nDeposited the money without realising it was compromised and now they're gone. Hopefully they're retrievable; at least I'm no longer on blockchain to risk it again.": 1, "~~It's highly unlikely that's the culprit. That problem was fixed very quickly and no new accounts are affected by it.  Not that OP shouldn't be careful but it's wrong to say that's the reason, and it's even worse because now he won't look for other possible reasons like his email or computer is compromised.~~\n\nEdit: i'm wrong. Didn't see that his address was one of the compromised ones": 1, 'Your address 1MR2fo3LAP4FQDFRteMxXcUuxRJ1W45jgu was posted on reddit, bitcointalk, all over the place as compromised :(.\n\nUnfortunately blockchain.info does not appear to have notified you.  (And as a wallet provider in my opinion they should have)\n\nUnless you got a email of some kind?\n\nIf anything they had the list of bad addresses they should have posted a notification or something in their web wallet when a address logged into the system warning of this issue.': 2}}}
