The 4 MB number is what happens if you fill a block with 100% 15-of-15 multisig transactions -- that is, 4 MB is what you can do if you're specifically making your blocks to try to attack the network. That means that with SegWit you get the negative network security effects of larger blocks without most of the capacity of larger blocks.\n\n> Also, why is 4 better than the 8 that is in BIP101?\n\nLarge blocks take longer to propagate, especially across the Great Firewall of China. 8 MB blocks are likely to strain block propagation more than 4 MB blocks.": 12, "> So then you'd be satisfied with 0.625 mb cap increase if Segwit is implemented as planned?\n\nNo.\n\nI don't think you are understanding my position. I oppose SegWit being pushed through on its current schedule in its current form. I think it should be done as a hard fork, without any byte discounting at all, and should come long after a hard fork blocksize increase.\n\nI think the 0.25x byte discounting in SegWit is effectively a subsidy for projects like Lightning and sidechains. Those projects have more complicated signature scripts than typical transactions, so they benefit more from the signature script discount. I don't like that. Lightning and sidechains should compete with on-chain transactions on their merits, not on their subsidies.\n\nAlso, I think that a 2 MB blocksize cap should be the first increase, not the last increase. I think it is urgent that we increase the blocksize to at least 2 MB within a few months, and that it is important that we schedule further increases so that we can keep ahead of demand. One way to do this is with a 2-4 proposal, in which the blocksize limit automatically scales over the course of the next two years.\n": 3, ">For the next few months, I expect SegWit transactions to comprise only 50% or so of the total, which would make the effective capacity only about 1.375 MB.\n\nSo then you'd be satisfied with 0.625 mb cap increase if Segwit is implemented as planned?": 1, 'For BIP101, the rule is actually to start at 8 MB, doubling every 2 years, *with linear interpolation* between the doubling points.': 22, "> Do you think Segwit should be implemented at all?\n\nYes, but not as a short-term capacity increase method. SegWit should be modified to have a cap for the coins+witness data to be 1.5 to 2.0 times the current cap. That would resolve the issue with the lost headroom for adversarial cases, while still providing the main benefits of SegWit (e.g. transaction malleability fixes, Schnorr signatures, fraud proofs, etc.).\n\n> Also, if you think Segwit should be implemented, from what I'm hearing you say (correct me if I'm wrong) a 0.25 MB increase would satisfy your present wishes right? 1.75+.25 gets us into the 2-4 range.

For the next few months, I expect SegWit transactions to comprise only 50% or so of the total, which would make the effective capacity only about 1.375 MB. \n\nThere are a few other objections that I have to SegWit as currently proposed. I would like to see a few things about it modified before we roll it out. In particular, I think it would be much better deployed as a hard fork than as a soft fork. The soft fork version seems like an ugly hack, and if we deploy SegWit that way, we'll be stuck with ugly code for the rest of Bitcoin's lifetime.\n\nSome of my objections can be seen here:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3yqe7c/segregated_witness_still_sounds_complicated_why/cyg2w0y": 5, '>I don\'t think you are understanding my position.\n\nI think I get it.

If that is true (I'm not convinced that it is) then the problem isn't with Coinbase but with the much more transparent nature of the blockchain than the legacy banking network. \n\nThe reason I'm not convinced that it's difficult for banks to automatically trace back fiat transactions more than just one step to fiat funds that are known to have been involved in a drug deal, is because I'm guessing that it's currently much more common that bitcoin has been a part of a drug deal than fiat. \n\nThat doesn't mean that it's something wrong with bitcoin. On the contrary. That just means that many criminals have discovered how much better bitcoin is than fiat and that ordinary citizens just haven't discovered that yet. I'm sure a high percentage of the first cars were used by bank robbers too because they could flee the scene of a crime much faster than by horse. But over time, the general population also discovered how much better a car is compared to a horse. So the percentage of cars involved in crimes lowered.

If companies are forced to trace back every source of bitcoin in an unlimited amount of steps (which is currently possible to do quickly and easily simply by looking at the public blockchain) then that will cause bitcoin to have zero fungibility. \n\nSo fix the fungibility problem or fix the AML / KYC laws.

So could there be a tragedy-of-the-commons type situation where everyone benefits from fungibility but nobody wants to take the time and money to set up JoinMarket?\n\nThe answer is *no*. Here\'s why. If fungibility becomes degraded, it would first show up that large bitcoin institutions will reject your coins with the message *"Your money is no good here. Those coins were used for illegal or immoral uses 3 transactions ago"*. When this happens the owner of those coins is going to google the problem. He\'ll notice that *if he uses JoinMarket, he can thwart the analysis of the coins*. So I think the fungibility problem solves itself once you have easy access to privacy. Any attempt to enforce non-fungibility of bitcoin will push people to seek out privacy solutions.\n\nThis means in all the literature we have to write about **unlinking coins from previous owners** to our reasons for privacy.

That way, support for such a hard fork can be gathered.\n\n* Attempt to reduce the credibility of Core devs by smearing and character assassination.\n\n* Keep spreading misinformation by repeatedly replying to Core devs postings forcing them to waste time writing lengthy replies.\n\n* Demotivate Core devs by repeated baseless accusations and rude ad hominems.\n\nAll of this has been happening, and although conspiracy is a heavy accusation, I consider it a credible explanation to the behavior of a small but vocal group of Redditors.": 37, 'I agree with this to a point.

Increases in the blocksize without the tech to increase scalability (e.g. IBLT, weak blocks, thin blocks, etc) will cause increased centralization. It's a tradeoff and there are modes where bitcoin works even with larger fees. (Changetip is an example of this where transactions are done off chain).\n\n2.) Even if we increase the limits, we will eventually hit the limits. If you look at all the worlds transactions (including credit cards, debit, cash transactions, esp when you get into settling stock trades which can be done WAY better on the blockchain) you are getting to the point where even tens to hundreds of gigabytes won't support the transaction levels that are theoretically possible. I don't see a scenario where we keep raising the block size fast enough and not hit the limit without over centralization. So, the question is would we rather hit that limit sooner or later? For me, as a Bitcoin holder, I'd rather hit that limit sooner and force solutions while we're still relatively young. Imagine if we pushed it out say 10 years from now and Bitcoin was the world reserve currency with a market cap of $20 trillion. Then it would be incredibly risky to do. I'd rather see it happen in the next 6 - 12 months when we're still not on everyone's radar.

Filing block space drives up all fees they run a disproportionate risk of loosing their spam to other miners, but profit on the higher fees paid by network users.\n\nIt would just take a cartel agreement of 51% of hashing power to eliminate all risk of loosing using this strategy. It could be undetectable and not appear hostile.\n\nObviously the cartel would be insecure if there were no block limit as it may be profitable to break from the cartel and go rogue collecting spam fees.\n': 1, 'He is a reference, he has been involved since shortly after Bitcoins creation.': 2, 'https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=217.0': 4, "That's just what Satoshi *wants* you to think.": 1}, ('Microsoft SIM Project Could Bring Thousands of Full Bitcoin Nodes To The Network - Bitcoinist.net', 0): {}}}
