I've never heard of BTC but I love this Norwegian band from my home in let's say Poland. So I'm driven to buy, as are other fans. The band gets BTC and possibly holds them, or spends them. (Right? Or do you pay them in their local currency ). Didn't this create buying pressure,  and new btc users. So successful crowdfunding and charity that drives new people to buy btc would raise the price of BTC, yes? \n\nSounds to me like this kind of service (which creates new buyers) should be bigger news in the community than merchants accepting bitcoin while driving down the price.

So Bitpieces, right now, can display all the values in MXN, or SEK, or CNY, or USD.\n\n> what if you can also take bank transfers\n\nThis is right out.

So... win/win? \n\nI\'m not sure I follow you here completely, but there are many sites which do this right now: coinbase is the one I use to buy my bitcoins (converting from dollars to BTC), and to handle the payment buttons on the site itself.\n\nI hope you have a good one.': 3, "> The band gets BTC and possibly holds them, or spends them.

That is somewhat true, but the main problem is that shorter confirmation times increase the orphaning rate for new blocks tremendously, which means that even though some nodes see a transaction as confirmed after 1 minute, that block has a relatively high risk of getting orphaned, thus adding an additional factor of uncertainty to every confimation.

With any 2 circles, you have 83% of the original circle.\n\nRight. But this is a 3-of-3 scheme.\n\nWhen you try increasing N, for example, you attempt a 3-of-6 by subdividing at 60 degrees, then you can have combinations of 3 parts that are not enough and combinations of two parts that are enough.': 1, 'not really practical in real life but a really cool demonstration none the less!': -1, 'Not with that scheme. ~~Slides are not symmetrical:~~ one is a one-time pad (i.e., a full-length random key) and the other is the QR code ciphered with it.\n\nEDIT: My bad. Ciphertext and one-time pad are fully statistically equivalent. Also, the article I linked describes already a M-of-N generalization; it is just needs more complex *shares* than the 2x2 squares that I implemented. Thanks for correcting me.\n\nYou could split the black dots of the code into separate slides and then have M-of-N schemes. But notice that doing this leaks partial information, which is worsened by QR error correction. In a 2-of-N scheme and with level "L" error correction (7% on average), you would be reducing the complexity of your key from 256 to 110 bits. This level should still be fairly uncrackable for an attacker finding only one of the slides (just like in BIP-0038, for an attacker finding the encrypted key, if the password is strong enough), but it is extremely important that you understand this (I do not want in any way to promote unsafe practices; *brainwallets* come to my mind).\n\n3-of-N or higher would be safer.

For level "L" error correction (7% on average) this would increase it to 110 bits.\n\nOf course, the visually cryptographic encoding that I presented is safer as it leaks nothing (i.e., independently of error correction, the attacker has still to crack all the 256 bits). I am just saying that the poor-man\'s half-code solution may still be uncrackable enough in practice.': 1, 'Before I start, when I say *overlapping section* or anything like that, I mean *redundant information* and not a *physical overlap*, which obviously is the whole premise of this system.\n\nSo basically if you have 3 keys that each overlap with every other key, then you have *2x3 / 2 = 3* overlapping sections. This is calculated by knowing that each of 3 keys has 2 overlapping sections, but each of these sections is a result of 2 keys overlapping. On top of that there is a section of each key which is not overlapping, causing 3 more sections (6 total).\n\nIn all honestly, you could have all the keys have differing amounts of information and it would work. Even if they all have 50% information, you could still have different amounts of overlap, but if you want them to all be equal then just take 100% and divide it by the 6 sections, leaving ~16.7%. I think of this like 3 semicircles on top of each other. One at 0 degrees, one at 120, and one at 240. It divides the circle up into 6 sections, 3 of which are overlapping sections and 3 of which are not. With any 2 circles, you have 83% of the original circle.\n\nFor the 4 keys example of 25% overlap, I took it to mean that each key has redundant information with only 2 of the others. Adjacent keys would have, combined, 75% information but opposite keys would have 100% information. I think of this like 4 (you guessed it) semicircles overlapping, one at 0 degrees, one at 90, 180, and 270. Opposite semicircles have no overlap and therefore carry 100% of the information. Adjacent semicircles have half of their information overlapping, i.e. 25% of the entire circle. Together this is 75% of the total information.

How do you make sure that they are perfectly cut in half, or four, or eight for that matter?\n\nA better method might actually be to just write down half/four/eight/sixteenth/etc of the private key and store them in different bank vaults.
