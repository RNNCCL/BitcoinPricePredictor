That cat is out of the bag.\n\nAnd I do think the technology as a concept will eventually change things, perhaps as much as the internet itself.\n\nAnd I actually think that Satoshi also knew this, that it wasn\'t the Bitcoin network itself that would succeed as a currency or commodity that would change the world, but the idea of the blockchain and peered network as a transactional and ledgering system itself, that it would mutate and become a better thing.\n\nI actually think that Satoshi designed the initial bitcoin network values to be deflationary specifically in order to drive the price up from low to high and keep them there briefly (a few years to a decade) to dangle a shiny carrot in front of early adopters in order to make it much more attractive and direct that attention to the blockchain itself, to get it out there.\n\nBecause if it didn\'t have that crazy ramp up from pennies per bitcoin to hundreds of dollars, likely not many people would have actually noticed Bitcoin\'s blockchain technology, or invested time/money into mining it or running nodes, or developing the core and aux code - because people probably would have just thought "Oh, yawn, another weird encrypted network scheme, yay."\n\nFurther, I think that Satoshi probably designed the network purposefully so that it wouldn\'t scale well beyond that initial hype, that it would self-destruct and have to be re-invented, because Satoshi is obviously very smart, and he would probably realize that the first adoption of it would be a gold rush and rife for attack and manipulation before it became a true service or protocol that was end-user friendly.\n\nI would further suppose that Satoshi intentionally made the network to be vulnerable to DDoS and 51% attacks (as well as fragmentation via hard forks) to ensure that it was eventually abandoned or deprecated, to intentionally ensure that it, itself, would not survive.\n\nBut that the idea would now survive. Because of speculation and hype driving the initial attention, for free.\n\nIf so, it\'s brilliant, really. Make a bunch of people pay for your marketing and dev, and even generate a weird amount of spendable value for the early birds, then unleash one hell of a viral idea on the financial world.

The computer, to me, is a proof-of-concept meant to get developers excited about the idea of a world where Bitcoin is truly ubiquitous: One where Bitcoin isn't used directly, much like how the Internet Protocol is ubiquitous but isn't accessed directly by 99.9% of the people in contact with it.\n\nAnyway, yes, if a service has a payment gateway (e.g., HTTP's 402 code, which 21 leverages heavily), Bitcoin can be used underneath the hood to access it. The mining generates a small stream of coins for people to use. It's hard to say exactly how many coins will be generated by a 21 computer. My raw, off-the-cuff guess is that you'd be insanely lucky to mine 0.1 BTC in a year, with 0.05 or so being more likely. However, we're talking about services that could be, say, 0.0002 BTC or something similarly small. You could access these services hundreds of times, if not thousands, not to mention the fact that you're always welcome to send coins directly to a wallet on the 21 computer.\n\nRegarding mining, my question would be in regards to what exactly you want to accomplish. Are you just curious about what goes into raw mining? If so, my honest advice, if I were you, would be to get a used Spondoolies SP20 for ~$300 used. They're pretty nice, and you'll get an idea of what goes into a true mining operation by operating one. Just be careful, as your electricity bill will go up quite a bit by using one (~$100/mth at a bare minimum). You'll also generate a few more coins when joining a pool, and you'll be forced to understand how to configure a miner and what goes into the process. 21 wants to cover up those details at the command line, although I suppose you could dive into the source code once it's released.": 1, 'Just following this thread to see any reviews': 1, 'Hmmm. Maybe I didn\'t fully explain. From a developer\'s perspective, what 21 is trying to do is get devs to build services that use Bitcoin as the underlying tool without people knowing that they\'re using Bitcoin. Stop and think about the technology that goes, say, into a sports car. Sure, a gearhead could spend hours explaining all the whiz-bang features in the latest Maserati, much like some people here can break down the nuts & bolts of the Bitcoin protocol. Chances are that both people would cause Joe Schmoe\'s eyes to glaze over once they go off on a tear. Joe Schmoe just wants a neat car or, more specifically, an easy way to pay for something.\n\nContrary to what some here believe, Bitcoin, as it stands, is a pretty awful payment system, especially for real-world purchases. Getting beyond the need to train the staff, it just takes way too much time. You also typically find yourself going through a payment processor, like Bitpay, that forces you to pause, pull out your phone, etc. Throw in sometimes flaky technology, and it\'s no wonder people would rather stick with cash or credit cards.\n\nAnyway, if you look at [21\'s API](https://21.co/learn/), you see that the basic point is to make payment relatively seamless. Have a few coins handy? Want to access something? No sweat. The code will automatically handle all that, preferably off-chain but on-chain is doable if you insist (and don\'t mind waiting a little while). In other words, 21 is trying to encourage developers to develop tools for truly frictionless payments. The mining chip is essentially a way to generate money that can be used to play with these services.\n\nWill all this succeed? No clue. I do think 21\'s onto something, though. I love all the technical details. I\'ve also failed to see how Mom & Dad will ever see a need for Bitcoin as is. For now at least, 21\'s trying to come up with tools that devs can use to "bootstrap" Joe Schmoe into Bitcoin, and keep Joe there. That\'s how I interpret it, anyway. I\'m sure 21 has more tricks up their sleeve.

This was the message:\n\nI doubt Ethereum endorses this at all. \n\n\nHello\nfrom bilqisaefentid sent 10 minutes ago\nI am sending you this message because the crypto community is too heavily censored, please read carefully.\nThe original of idea bitcoin is to create a decentralized money system that prevents censorship and being shutdown. Proof of work seemed like a good way to achieve that. The real power in the bitcoin world is helt by the miners, as long as the mining process is properly decentralized bitcoin will be decentralized. But real world competition caused many cracks to appear in this model, the first flaws that appeared were pooled mining (centralizing power with mining operators), then came ASICs (Centralizing power with mining operators with good industry connections), then came cheap electricity + latency issues (Centralizing power with mining pools with access to cheap electicity and low latency to others big mining pools). These pressures has essentially caused mining to be centalized mainly in China because there they have cheap electricity, good industry for creating ASICs and low latency to other chinese mining pools (and high latency to the rest of the world).\nOne important thing to keep in mind is that bitcoin itself can evade capital controls and move seamlessly accross borders. But mining equipment cannot. It would be easy to confiscate all mining equipment in the country and use it to destroy bitcoin.\nSo what is the solution to this problem? Proof of stake is the solution because it removed the physical element and allows network voting power to move seamlessly accross borders too. Traditional Proof of Stake contains some flaws like the Nothing at Stake problem. But the new algorithm designed for proof of stake in Ethereum solved all these issues.\nThe bitcoin developer community has proven that it is unable to make even small changed to the consesus algorithm. So completely switching to a different model is never going to happen.\nIf you are willing to open your mind and learn about how Ethereum will beat bitcoin by being far superior to bitcoin watch the videos of Devcon1\nBitcoin is doomed and Ethereum will replace it.\nObviously most people involved in Ethereum are aware of this. But for most other people it is not so obvious. But it is hard to convince the masses because they are not reading enough information about Ethereum, either because of censorship in subs or because of denial.\nTherefore I think it is the mission of each of us to get the word out. Only by saying it often and giving clear examples we can teach the masses what we already know. Try to reach at least on uninformed person every day. (If you lack ideas, just post the link to this post in different reddit subs with target audience).\nFirst of all it is important to remind people that Bitcoin was also once small, and that people also did not believe in Bitcoin because they couldn\'t imagine what benefit it would give over conventional payment systems. That perception changed dramatically for bitcoin and the same will happen to Ethereum. It is important to emphasise this because people often use the psychological principle of Social Proof to make decisions in unknown situations, this is currently working against Ethereum, the underlying reasoning is, "If Ethereum is so great why is it so cheap?", "If Ethereum is so great why is everyone talking about Bitcoin?", "If Ethereum is so great, why are the smart people X, Y and Z not invested in it?".\nSecond of all it is important to emphasise that not only is Ethereum a crypto that offers a whole new concept of the decentralized web, it is also better than Bitcoin at being a currency for payments. This is easy to show by explaining a real world scenario. Imagine the perfect crypto currency, obviously it should be possible to re-implement the most convenient payment systems used today using that crypto currency, and doing so in a decentralized way, with no added fees or middle man. It should be able to behave very much like cash in being able to spend it quick and easy. The most similar electronic product that offers this is the anonymous tap to pay, prepaid payment card. It is easy, it is anonymous, it wont be hacked like phones, it has the ability to limit exposure to compromise by having limited balance that automatically recharged and the end of the day. Implementing this in Bitcoin would not be possible because the small chip in the card is not connected to the internet, and sharing your private key is a security hazard. But what if your wallet/contract could use asymmetric encryption to accept a different secret payment key on every payment. This way it is possible to implement the payment with a touch to pay card in a secure way. In Ethereum it is also possible to program a contract to recharge a wallet at the end of every day for added security, It is also possible to automatically exchange Ethereum for a token that is backed by a stable currency for those merchants that are worried about exchange fluctuations.\nThird of all it is important to note that Bitcoin is never going to be implementing these changes. Look how hard it is for them to implement a blocksize increase. Changing the scripting language to Turing complete would be a far more controversial change. One that the miners will probably never agree to this. And also keep in mind that quick payments need either zero-confirmation transactions or fast blocktime.\nSo if Ethereum has the potential to implement the most convenient payment system imaginable but Bitcoin cannot then one can only conclude that Ethereum will win in the long run. Bitcoin will die like Myspace, and Ethereum will become the golden standard.\n\nEXhale, TL;DR.': 3, "Actually, yes... and since it's designed to look like really wanting an opinion, I even wasted time responding (only got one of those).

It looks like Jonathan Toomim may have succeeded in forming a consensus of miners, which (if true and if those miners follow through) should put the block size issue to bed for at least another year or two.

Proof of work seemed like a good way to achieve that. The real power in the bitcoin world is helt by the miners, as long as the mining process is properly decentralized bitcoin will be decentralized. But real world competition caused many cracks to appear in this model, the first flaws that appeared were pooled mining (centralizing power with mining operators), then came ASICs (Centralizing power with mining operators with good industry connections), then came cheap electricity + latency issues (Centralizing power with mining pools with access to cheap electicity and low latency to others big mining pools). These pressures has essentially caused mining to be centalized mainly in China because there they have cheap electricity, good industry for creating ASICs and low latency to other chinese mining pools (and high latency to the rest of the world).\nOne important thing to keep in mind is that bitcoin itself can evade capital controls and move seamlessly accross borders. But mining equipment cannot. It would be easy to confiscate all mining equipment in the country and use it to destroy bitcoin.\nSo what is the solution to this problem? Proof of stake is the solution because it removed the physical element and allows network voting power to move seamlessly accross borders too. Traditional Proof of Stake contains some flaws like the Nothing at Stake problem. But the new algorithm designed for proof of stake in Ethereum solved all these issues.\nThe bitcoin developer community has proven that it is unable to make even small changed to the consesus algorithm. So completely switching to a different model is never going to happen.\nIf you are willing to open your mind and learn about how Ethereum will beat bitcoin by being far superior to bitcoin watch the videos of Devcon1\nBitcoin is doomed and Ethereum will replace it.\nObviously most people involved in Ethereum are aware of this. But for most other people it is not so obvious. But it is hard to convince the masses because they are not reading enough information about Ethereum, either because of censorship in subs or because of denial.\nTherefore I think it is the mission of each of us to get the word out. Only by saying it often and giving clear examples we can teach the masses what we already know. Try to reach at least on uninformed person every day. (If you lack ideas, just post the link to this post in different reddit subs with target audience).\nFirst of all it is important to remind people that Bitcoin was also once small, and that people also did not believe in Bitcoin because they couldn\'t imagine what benefit it would give over conventional payment systems. That perception changed dramatically for bitcoin and the same will happen to Ethereum. It is important to emphasise this because people often use the psychological principle of Social Proof to make decisions in unknown situations, this is currently working against Ethereum, the underlying reasoning is, "If Ethereum is so great why is it so cheap?", "If Ethereum is so great why is everyone talking about Bitcoin?", "If Ethereum is so great, why are the smart people X, Y and Z not invested in it?".\nSecond of all it is important to emphasise that not only is Ethereum a crypto that offers a whole new concept of the decentralized web, it is also better than Bitcoin at being a currency for payments. This is easy to show by explaining a real world scenario. Imagine the perfect crypto currency, obviously it should be possible to re-implement the most convenient payment systems used today using that crypto currency, and doing so in a decentralized way, with no added fees or middle man. It should be able to behave very much like cash in being able to spend it quick and easy. The most similar electronic product that offers this is the anonymous tap to pay, prepaid payment card. It is easy, it is anonymous, it wont be hacked like phones, it has the ability to limit exposure to compromise by having limited balance that automatically recharged and the end of the day. Implementing this in Bitcoin would not be possible because the small chip in the card is not connected to the internet, and sharing your private key is a security hazard. But what if your wallet/contract could use asymmetric encryption to accept a different secret payment key on every payment. This way it is possible to implement the payment with a touch to pay card in a secure way. In Ethereum it is also possible to program a contract to recharge a wallet at the end of every day for added security, It is also possible to automatically exchange Ethereum for a token that is backed by a stable currency for those merchants that are worried about exchange fluctuations.\nThird of all it is important to note that Bitcoin is never going to be implementing these changes. Look how hard it is for them to implement a blocksize increase. Changing the scripting language to Turing complete would be a far more controversial change. One that the miners will probably never agree to this. And also keep in mind that quick payments need either zero-confirmation transactions or fast blocktime.\nSo if Ethereum has the potential to implement the most convenient payment system imaginable but Bitcoin cannot then one can only conclude that Ethereum will win in the long run. Bitcoin will die like Myspace, and Ethereum will become the golden standard.': 1, "The only thing I can say positively is that at least the /r/ethereum mods have put up a sticky somewhat denouncing these actions.

Banks exist because people want a safe place to store their money, and because people want to borrow money.\n\nBitcoin is actually EASIER to steal than cash, so people will have an even greater need for a safe place to store it.  Many, many people get their computer broken into. \n\nBitcoin most certainly doesn\'t eliminate the need for loans.  \n\nIt\'s remained a mystery why everyone on this sub thinks "Bitcoin = replacement for entire financial system".  That\'s just nonsense, and obviously not true.\n\nNow...  bitcoin IS a replacement for transmitting money without fees.

Also, what happens if a mechanical engineer designs a terrible elevator that kills people: he loses his job, his license, and most likely spends time in jail. What happens if a Keynesian economist makes terrible judgement calls while serving as federal reserve chairman and as a result tens of millions lose their livelihoods:nothing the next guy/gal has a go.

Of all the wrong in the above post I leave you to consider these 5 quick points:\n\n>that it is more comparable to gold\n\nThen it is ultimately deflationary. Deflation means real debts become expensive and no one uses bitcoin in any meaningful way.\n\n>No one thinks it will REPLACE fiat completely. It is more like gold. But yes we do believe it will be used more than fiat if it becomes popular, in which case the value of one bitcoin will rise dramatically\n\nIf it is used more than fiat.... it is the defacto vehicle currency (like the US dollar). If it isn\'t used like fiat then its just a tech experiment. As long as the value of bitcoin is crystallised through a fiat currency it cannot overtake its use.\n\n>Also, you didn\'t reply to "volatility in capitalist financial systems. To answer your unspoken question, no capitalism is not a system that is working any longer.\n\nBecause the market is made of human actors and human actors are not fully rational and do not have perfect information. No system in the world will not have shocks. And again you age is showing, because we have suffered recessions before. And equality was been worse. This is why we have governments to correct those things.\n\n>Uh...I mean the same shit will still apply, bitcoin will just clear up a lot of the middlemen, the pervasive control. You\'re reading the words but not understanding...you\'re still just trying to poke holes in the concept. I\'m trying to tell you that the concept is sound.\n\nNo sir you still haven\'t fundamentally even begun to understand my questions, but you are certain it has been answered (maybe read some of the books on the system you feel is so terrible). Interest rates are defined across multiple institutions and set daily across the maturity curve, using US gov debt/depository rates as a benchmark (each country uses a slightly diff benchmark) (all interest rates are floating rates, a fixed rate is swapped rate no matter where it occurs on any appreciable scale). If bitcoin is deflationary (and it is defacto since its amount is fixed and bitcoin can be lost, destroyed) then any interest rate policy mechanism will be terrible in its used. If bitcoin takes hold without the preceding, then you have every bitcoin actor setting a personal interest rate. Hence very little to no market clearing at any appreciable size. That is where that tricky lender of resort issue comes in. Do you understand now? Do you understand how little you have thought this through?\n\n>So very educated idiot, you\'re saying that those decisions that the political and financial elite make have NO BEARING on the decisions/changes that ordinary people have to make regarding their financial affairs?\n\nOk listen I\'m was trying to be civil, but you must be a fucking numbnut not to understand the bailout was done to ultimately help ordinary people not get completely wiped out by a DEPRESSION. Did it save a shit load of banks? Ofcourse, because saving the banks meant saving consumers ultimately. That was the political calculus. Banks took advantage of that and got favorable terms. That is the bit to be pissed off about. \n\n>Seriously? Let me ask you a question, for what reason has inequality gone up after the bailouts and QE? Who has it benefited most, why? Answer that one.\n\nI will answer it. I mean you avoided my lender of last resort question (I suspect because as most experts agree bitcoin or any currency is fucked without it) but here we go. Do you know what assets benefited MOST from QE? Treasuries, MBS and ABS.\n\nDo you know who held the **LARGEST QUANTITIES OF THESE AND RELATED ASSETS.**\n\n***Pension funds.*** Thus QE saved your and your parents retirement savings. Bet you didn\'t know that you jackass.\n\n**TL;DR: if you really are a young guy, then please take an economics course. Economics, despite what people may think, is an exceptionally difficult subject which is not intuitive to figure out. You would not argue about complex topics in mechanical engineering with this level of certainty, yet for some reason you feel your pseudo-wikipedia level of knowledge makes you judge the merits of bitcoin.

Having watching 1.5 hours of this video so far, I am actually impressed in how much good information is presented. There are certainly "scared banker" guys in the room (Ryan Zigota sic? with Ripple who speaks at 1:27:00 seems like he might be particularly bitcoin hostle - but I didn\'t hear enough to judge for certain), but many others who extoll the virtues of bitcoin and probably others who are completely lost and staying silent. Even scared banker guy aka Mike\'s boss aka Charley Cooper says some intelligent things. In particular at 1:26:00 where he talks about on loading non bitcoin asset classes onto the bitcoin blockchain and the potential to have the mining reward be overtaken by the reward to do harm. In all I was impressed with the openness of the discussion and the positive representation of bitcoin. This wasn\'t just a meeting of evil regulators and big bankers IMO.

I understand that most bitcoin users do not have the true grasp of global economics or currency dynamics, but this stuff is fundamental.\n\nThis is essentially why it will never replace fiat currencies (this is not me saying it, its the Bank of England).

I am 100% certain you have no true idea of how fundamental to European recovery that asset class is/will remain or how that asset class works or is structured. You know some bad shit happened in 2008, thus all securitisation bad.\n\nLook man you are an enlightened cynic. I get it. It\'s a great shtick, but fundamentally you do not understand the things that you oppose. \n\n>Yes I\'m speaking of the fractional reserve system. It\'s a house of cards.\n\nCase in point. What does the above even mean? Fractional reserve banking is a corner stone of sound monetary policy. It\'s the reason that despite your (inaccurate) assessment that bankers are "creating loans outta no where" the central bank can simply tighten the reserve requirement and the excess liquidity dries up. Your problem is probably that you are too young to have even lived during a tightening cycle. Where does the house of cards come in?\n\n**TL:DR: Bitcoin was made by nerds to be cool.
