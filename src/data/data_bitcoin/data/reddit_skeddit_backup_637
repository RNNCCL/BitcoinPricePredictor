I much prefer the laid back humour to the anger, bitterness and rampant trolls taking advantage of people feeling down to put the boot in even more.\n\nI'm far more chilled about it this time because I have perspective of previous years and know that bitcoin is well and truly here to stay now. I won't tell you to relax, but I don't think you should be panicking either. That said, if this is hurting you financially you shouldn't be risking so much in bitcoin and should be only putting into bitcoin what you can afford to lose.": 28, "I think it will be decades by the absolute earliest, and as I [understand it](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/6062/what-effects-would-a-scalable-quantum-computer-have-on-bitcoin), even when quantum computers do become viable and available, developers will have years and maybe even longer to analyse how it will affect Bitcoin, and determine what changes need to be made to the cryptography being used. \n\nI'm quite certain that from the time quantum computers become functional, to where they are used to exploit Bitcoin's security, there will be ample time for developers to react and upgrade the cryptographic algorithms used to ensure that Bitcoins aren't compromised. This is not really something people should be worried about at all as most of the modern world uses the same cryptographic algorithms that Bitcoin uses, so if quantum computers become a threat to Bitcoin's security, then a large swath of the modern world is going to be worried about the first quantum computer threatening the security of the world's communications too. There will be ample warning IMO.": 2, 'Or the kanye gif?': 9, 'If btc were a ponzi then it would have been gone quite a while ago': 1, "My fears in the early days were:\n\n* Bitcoin being ruled illegal to use and possess in the majority of countries around the world. Especially the developed world. This hasn't happened, and though the reception has been mixed, overall, it has been quite positive for Bitcoin overall. I had serious concerns that governments would see Bitcoin as an existential threat and stamp it out. \n\n* A critical bug in the codebase being found rendering Bitcoin irreparably insecure. Similar things had happened in the very early days with Bitcoins code so I felt justified in being concerned that something even worse could have  lurked in the codebase, but nowadays with so many reimplementations and devs/hackers scouring the code for flaws, I feel far more at ease. Every year this doesn't happen, gives more and more confidence in the blockchain and POW used in Bitcoin.\n\n* Businesses ostensibly turning their backs on acceptance in droves. What has instead happened is that merchants have been given a leg up with Bitpay/Coinbase/ et al. and this has enabled far more merchants to accept, and be part of the Bitcoin ecosystem thus helping to generate demand for Bitcoins and allowing the Bitcoin economy to build a solid amount of constant commerce. This is vital for Bitcoin's longevity as smauging coins is not going to ensure miners get paid, every block needs to be including large numbers of transactions in the future if Bitcoin is going to stand a chance, and the only way that is going to happen is if there's lots of Bitcoin related commerce.\n\n* Developers doing the same. What has happened instead is developers have appeared in droves to work on all manner of Bitcoin projects. It's been wonderful to see, and not just software, hardware too, engineers have been designing ASICs, hardware wallets, and have been tinkering in all manner of different ways with Bitcoin (colored coins, sidechains, etc.). This was nonexistent 2.5 years ago. 3 years ago, all we had was the core client, now we have a number of reimplementations and this helps mitigate the risk of flaws being found in the core client and also helps to decentralise development. \n\n* Exchanges disappearing due to losses, mistrust, bad management etc. and us being left with no way for money to flow into and out of the Bitcoin economy. Instead we have a multitude of very solid, and reputable exchanges. Even 2 years ago, trying to get my hands on Bitcoin was an exercise in frustration, and patience, I feared that if things stayed this way, there was no way people were going to even bother tinkering with Bitcoin. We also have ATMs of all varieties enabling people to not even need to deal with banks if they want Bitcoin. The beginning of last year there wasn't a single Bitcoin ATM, they were still an idea, now there are hundreds around the world. \n\nThese were my fears, and I think there was a very real possibility that they could become a reality. Instead we've had an enormous amount of growth in all of these areas and it continues to do so. 3-4 years ago none of this was even on the drawing board and I worried that Bitcoin really was going to fail to inspire and motivate people to build the wonderful tools, hardware, software, businesses, commerce, security, and other things that Bitcoin needed to enable people to take full advantage of Bitcoin's potential.\n\nSaying it could quite easily fails means you have absolutely no perspective on what Bitcoin is like now, compared to what Bitcoin was like years ago.

No one really knows. So my approach has always been: treat it as a pure gamble. When I bought bitcoin (not that much, for this reason), I wrote the whole amount off in my mind, just as though I had set it on fire. If you're not willing to do that with your money, don't invest in bitcoin. \n\nBut, as I said: don't trust me, or any other random person on Reddit.

I haven\'t indicated a buy for this dip yet because the average I\'m tracking is still up at $320 - so even with the price at $240 the average would be falling too fast to buy.\n\nI think a lot of people who got into Bitcoin last year are in the same boat - wanting to stay invested but their cost basis is too high.
