Bitcoin mining is NOT decentralized, certainly not geographically or by entity.\n\n**Geographic centralization:**\n\nBitcoin mining has been tending towards large datacenters owned by less and less people for the past few years now. There's really only six spots where mines are being run: Georgia (Country), Washington State (particularily in Chelan County), Inner Mongolia (Northern China), Tibet (Western-Central China), and Boden, Sweden. Labrador and Iceland get a participation medal for a couple of petahashes each, but they are small fry compared to the big fish. As an aside, namstec looks like they're going to get hashing in venezuela within a month, which is very interesting IMO. Their datacenter looks pretty neat. Still, we're only talking in terms of a few petahashes here, which is piss in the wind.\n\n**Centralization by entity:**\n\nBitfury, BW/Antpool (they operate a large DC), MegaBigPower, and KnC control a scarily large percentage of the network. Throw in a few medium sized players like HAOBTC, Lee Group, Avalon (no data, but presumably big) and Spondoolies and I wouldn't be suprised if you're over 50% right there. \n\nFor details about mining infrastructure see:\n\nhttps://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1328580.0\n\n*Many mining ops intentionally don't report/misreport their hashrate/hardware, so it's fairly hard to pin down exactly who owns what.*": 2, 'Spot on.

So, for them, it is money if they can buy groceries with it. That\'s why they emphasize importance of point-of-sale payments.\n\nBut here in Ukraine we have an actual problem, neither the government nor banks are trustworthy. People who have savings usually keep them in US dollars, and often in cash. You can\'t buy groceries with US dollars, they are not accepted in stores. However, you can easily exchange your dollars for a local currency, hryvna, and then use it to buy things.\n\nSo we understand money as something which is preserves value well and is liquid (can be exchanged easily), whether it is accepted in stores or not doesn\'t matter.\n\nBitcoin\'s "killer app" is store of value which is independent of governments and banks, we should focus on that.\n\nAs for 0-conf payments, this can be done securely without any complex technology, using so-called "green address" approach: get every transaction co-signed by a trusted party. But people keep using highly unsafe 0-conf based on mempool policies. We need to break unsafe 0-conf to make safe 0-conf work. It\'s needed not for technical reasons, but because right now people just don\'t see a problem and don\'t feel a need to upgrade to something better, establish common protocols etc. It isn\'t hard to implement, but right now people have 0 incentives to switch.': 20, "I don't think you are.

': 5, "> in the distant future\n\nThis is the key point - Bitcoin was designed to transition to using fees in the distant future as block rewards approach zero.

It\'s really sad to see this kind of propaganda going on - but whoever reads this needs to understand that what he wrote is wrong.\n\nFirst, understand this: To get new users over the past three to four years, Bitcoin has sold the idea that it would allow **users to send money anywhere, quickly and free. Period.** That was the revolutionary idea. Bitcoin is valuable because of its transaction utility. None of this "oh we have to take your money now" approach.\n\nThis promise was floated freely in /r/bitcoin several years ago. However, Valery\'s vision is new, different and miner-centric. It breaks this original promise. In effect he\'s saying, "Welp, it no longer does that, so let\'s take that part off the website. It\'s still good *enough*."\n\nValery is essentially saying that the block reward isn\'t enough to keep miners mining, when the system is designed to become easier to mine when there are less miners around.\n\nThe idea that miners have to make additional money off of transaction fees in order to have *enough* incentive to continue mining... It\'s basically not trusting the system to work as designed. In that case why do we even have a block reward? In this scenario, miners are no different than any credit card payment processor, taking money off of the top.\n\nThis idea that a fee is necessary is totally wrong, and here\'s why:\n\n**If you take away the basic fundamental user incentive to use the system, you undermine the value of that system.**\n\nIf Bitcoin is free to use, more people will use it. If more people use it the value goes up. That increased value then provides the only necessary incentive to mine Bitcoin. If the price goes down, less miners will be mining and discovering new blocks becomes easier. This is how the system should work.\n\nBitcoin isn\'t for miners or Nasdaq settlements. Bitcoin\'s primary function is for the basic user. Everyone can be their own bank. Anyone can send money to anyone, for free.\n\nAll transactions on the network should work in a timely manner and 10,000 unconfirmed transactions is unacceptable.

But if the centralization takes place in services on top of the blockchain then at least you still can be your own bank and keep the bitcoins that you dont need instant free transactions for in the near future on your own wallet on a blockchain that is decentralized and secure.\n\nThe payments that require instant verifications are small payments anyway, so centralization wouldnt matter.

Is just plain silly IMO. PayPal, VISA, are a scourge. The hope that Bitcoin can destroy and replace them as an open payment network has been my reason for hodling and using Bitcoin since 2011.\n\nDoes he not realise how much these organisations control actual real *commerce*? Is that really of no importance? To have a store of value, you need to also have free commerce to earn that value in the first place... BOTH are so very important.\n\n>No increase of the block size limit could help make instant Bitcoin transaction confirmation a reality.\n\nYet somehow, it\'s working right now. I paid a bitpay invoice yesterday and got my new VPS running, all in under a minute. With risk analysis, it works, and in many situations services can be retracted if the payment later fails.\n\n>FACT 2: Bitcoin Is Not and Should Not Be Free to Use\n\nSomehow, he thinks people won\'t just move to a different cryptocurrency, along with the large amount of investors/hodlers who see a permissionless global payment network as a thing of huge value. Block rewards will pay for security for decades. And in the meantime, research could be done on what *actual* amount of hashing power is required to provide "adequate security".\n\n>FACT 3: Bitcoin Transaction Processing Is Not Presently Clogged\n\nThat\'s nice and all - but don\'t bother planning for the future, or anything. A double or more in legitimate commerce could happen far more quickly than any consensus on a block size increase. (And the question: "What is reasonable tx fee?" is never answered... If we cannot define that, we can never know if there is any clogging. Average tx fees are a direct result of the block size - we can\'t look at them alone and say they are not a reason to increase the size, since users may be going elsewhere.)\n\n>FACT 4: Miners Embrace Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s Popularity\n\nExcellent. Now take some thought as to whether Bitcoin\'s price (i.e. the thing that guarantees a miner an income) has any link to a hodler\'s speculation in the great value of a permissionless global payment network. Cripple this, and you might find you can no longer pay your electricity bills. But you may not realise until it\'s too late.\n\n>FACT 6: Mass Rule is Not Appropriate for Bitcoin\n\nLargely irrelevant whether its appropriate or not. Miners control Bitcoin.\n\n>XT would not have eliminated transaction fees\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8ait would have merely delayed the development of the fee market\n\nOnly if tx rates had actually increased as fast as the block size growth. There\'s a fee market even with sizes under the limit - miners get to decide what tx are worth putting in the block. A large enough pool can hold this arbitrarily high, and you\'ll have to meet that if you want an absolute guarantee of being included in the next block.\n\n>XT ... would have made things worse by elevating the requirements to maintain a full Bitcoin node\n\nIt\'s largely unproven whether this would make things "worse". More growth as a payment network might in the long term mean more motivated people running nodes. And what even counts as "decentralised"? Compare it to the number of Tor network exit nodes, something else with massive use and a highly importance for having non compromised nodes.\n\nIn summary, these statements are called "facts" when they are just other sides of a coin, an alternative bias.

Bitcoin lives and dies by the market, so it can only benefit Bitcoin if the market can express itself more clearly, saying what paths it likes and doesn\'t like.\n\nOne small note: Provided the process is well-publicized in advance and happens on all the major exchanges, I do think it would be over in minutes, or even seconds, because of the feedback loop the author mentions.

Look, ultimately Michael was right about the need for increased blocks to increase throughput.   That's just natural evolution.   You can argue against, but it's evolution and what the masses want.   You can't stop that train.   Michael was just trying too hard in a short timeframe (probably because of some cash payout for making it happen.   He's not a leader of anyone of real import as you noted, so there was no way he could move that mountain that fast).    Bitcoin isn't meant to topple governments or create chaos or take power from them, or for people to hide money from taxes etc.   It's a another very useful in tool in the currency toolbox that allows us to be our own bank or move currency around the world with no middleman taking a piece if we don't want what they offer.

All from the blockchain with regular bitcoin transactions that will end up on the blockchain.\n\nLN has nothing to do with sidechains.\n\nAs the author of the blog post said, if you are quite distant from bitcoin (and if you don't know about payment channels let's me honestly say you're not on top of the game) you would think his piece is an attack to Mike but nothing could be further from the truth - Mike has been a pathological lier doing politics to deceive people for years now.\n": 2, 'Yea, I know that, but sidechains are part of LN, I\'ve read the summary, and some articles, [like this](http://www.coindesk.com/could-the-bitcoin-lightning-network-solve-blockchain-scalability/), and the points they make on **Associated risks** made me worried, like: *The counterparty may also be able to steal funds if one of the participants losses data. This can be mitigated by installing a third-party data storage service where encrypted data gets sent to this third party service.*, and the final quotation: *"One should choose channel counterparties who are responsible and willing to provide the current state, with some periodic tests of honesty."*. It gives me the impression that I will have to pay someone to backup my data, and/or I will have to pay someone to be a part of my transactions so that they can be safe. \n\nedit: fixing the link': -1, 'So, I read it all and some of it\'s links, and while a lot of it is just personal attacks on Mike, it make some points that is unclear at this point (At least for me):\n\n1) The current state of Lighting Network (LN), it\'s ETA and it\'s cost of operations. Some people make it looks like LN is a private network that we will have to pay to use, and that "Vanilla" Bitcoin is being held back so to make LN more attractive. I\'ve read a bit on LN, it\'s sidechains, but it was unclear if I could send some money from my PC to my mobile (Both who run a client outside any wallet providers [Why replace banks with wallets?]), then go to a cafe and buy my Latte, or when I order some late night pizza, will sidechains help me get my latte or my pizza without waiting for it? And if yes, without any associated fee to be paid to anyone else but the miners? If I need to send money to my mom, on another country, for an urgent matter, and then I go offline for some reason, will it mess with the sidechain?\n\n2) I kind of see the point with RBF, and I think it is good to be able to bid for a spot on the next block, or to be able to call back my coins if I send them to the wrong guy, or to be able to fix any last-minute mistake in general... But I think people rely on the current risk and trade-offs to do business, simply take it from them and tell they did it wrong is to blunt. Like [this NYT article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/magazine/how-bitcoin-is-disrupting-argentinas-economy.html?_r=0), will they be able to do that kind of transaction with RBF? Will they have to wait one hour to get six confirmations and only then complete their transaction? If no, all Argentinians will have to opt-out of RBF? If yes, it doesn\'t means a lot of people will end up not opting in to it, so deepening the divide on community?\n\n3) I understand SegWit benefits, and at first I agreed with it, but then I read the other side, as it implements a lot of changes on an important part of the code (the consensus part), and people arguing that it is deployed too fast, before a big test can be made to grant that it is safe and harmless, other argument is that it *may* give the benefit of an 1.75MB block without messing with the limit, but it will take time, and even so, will be only in best case scenarios. These arguments aren\'t covered on any post or QA that I\'ve found so far, so it is hard to judge if it is the right move to do now. I\'m even more on the against team due to the fact that doubling the block size seems to be easy to implement (So easy that Bitcoin Classic devs did it and are ready to push it to everyone), and I think it will do far less harm than a 4MB or a 8MB block would on the current state of decentralization.\n\nI think the problem is how this all is being pushed out. I would be more with Core, if they took the 2MB block, then create a big informative QA about SegWit, covering any easily imaginable way of abusing it with old nodes and old wallets, with explanations, both simple and complex, on how to avoid them. Then they could improve (and I\'m willing to help with it) the LN site, with more explanations on current status, ETA, changes from current bitcoin, another big QA about questions like the ones I placed on my first point, and so on. Other thing is avoid the arms race, and be more open about discussions and explanations. I know it may be hard to talk the same lines a thousand time, but it is good for people to be able to get a good reply to their worries with the people some other people are calling as evil. Mike may deserve all the adjectives core people put on him on the last days, but do you really need to call him like that in every single post? It makes reading your counter posts even harder, and boring, and level the game too low. Why not answer his points with a plain conciliatory text, with a lot of links with both simple and complex explanations to why are his points wrong? I know it maybe even harder to be polite with him may be hard, but being polite help us to pick your side instead of his.': 3, "Sidechains are not part of LN.

Both terms "consensus" and "rough consensus" predate Bitcoin-style consensus.\n\nPrior usages are irrelevant. In Bitcoin world, "consensus" is a technical term with regard to Bitcoin nodes & people should avoid confusion by not using it in other meanings.\n\nThe same thing is "bit" in computer world. Bit was a word long before computers, but now, in the world of computers, "bit" has [exact technical meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit) & people should not be using it in other meanings (like Bitcoin bits, *sigh*).\n\nComputer was also used before computers. Now, computer is a machine, not a person anymore. \n\nAgain, in Bitcoin world, "consensus" is a technical term. It denotes something in the working of Bitcoin nodes that is necessary for Bitcoin network to function.

It's like special relativity that way.  The RBF code in Core both allows simple payment channels (not like LN's features, but they can reduce fees) and makes explicit to merchants existing limitations of the transaction ordering logic.

The old software will not be compatible with the bigger blocks and would ignore them as invalid. That is why the bitcoin-core devs want to avoid this as much as possible, also it has various sideeffects like increased bandwidth usage.\n\nMultiple proposals were discussed to do this but in the end the [bitcoin-core developers decided](https://bitcoincore.org/en/2015/12/23/capacity-increases-faq/) to go with something called [segregated witness](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0141.mediawiki) first - mostly because it can be done as a [softfork](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Softfork) and it fixes something called [transaction malleability](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction_Malleability) - with this the blockdata gets split into transaction and signature, and if I understand it correctly one part will go into the 1MB block and another into an external data structure.

It would start creating bigger blocks after 750 out of 1000 blocks have been mined with this new software (but there are still discussions about this value, some want it to go up to 950 out of 1000 blocks), until that happens it will be compatible with the current 1MB blockchain.\n\nThere is still a chance that a solution will be found, but in case a hardfork really happens there will be a lot of uncertainty around this, so the exchange price could take a hit. \n \nIn optimal case most fullnodes upgrade the software and the 1MB chain is quickly abandoned, because there is no mining, no exchange to sell, no liquidity.
