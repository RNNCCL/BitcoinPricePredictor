JENKINS, JR.\nAug. 14, 2015 6:42 p.m. ET\n\nConflicts of interest are endemic to professional life. How professionals deal with them is what makes them professionals. But that\xe2\x80\x99s just the beginning of a story that has banking circles in New York buzzing. The episode suggests just how much bank bashing has become a fiscal racket.\n\nDid a prominent, politically connected advisory firm, Promontory Financial Group, go easy on its client bank, Britain\xe2\x80\x99s Standard Chartered? Promontory had been hired by the bank\xe2\x80\x99s outside lawyers to help comply with an Iran sanctions-busting investigation. In emails produced by New York regulators, Promontory is seen changing wording of its final report after objections from the bank. One email says \xe2\x80\x9cthe most important thing is that we get to the end of the project without jeopardizing our relationship\xe2\x80\x9d with the client.\n\nThen again, such glimpses inside the sausage factory can be overinterpreted. Standard Chartered was the client; it had a right to be consulted. And, at the end of the day, Promontory\xe2\x80\x99s work did help to produce what would become nearly $1 billion in fines and settlements paid by the bank.\n\nBut another kind of conflict of interest may be implicated. New York\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Financial Services was investigating Promontory for two years. Negotiations reportedly broke down over Promontory\xe2\x80\x99s unwillingness\xe2\x80\x94along with paying a penalty\xe2\x80\x94to acknowledge wrongdoing and accept a suspension of its ability to work with New York clients. (Reputation is important to such firms.)\n\nBenjamin Lawsky, former superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services. ENLARGE\nBenjamin Lawsky, former superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services. PHOTO: MIKE GROLL/ASSOCIATED PRESS\nThat\xe2\x80\x99s when the New York agency issued an official yet informal report citing vague derelictions and effectively banning Promontory from business in New York by prohibiting local banks from sharing non-public documents with the advisory firm. This action came barely one month after the agency\xe2\x80\x99s flamboyant chief, Benjamin Lawsky, who launched the investigation, left to create his own private consulting firm to compete with Promontory.\n\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s more: Mr. Lawsky is a prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 of New York\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Mr. Cuomo created the New York Department of Financial Services, appointed Mr. Lawsky to head it, and publicly delighted in the $5 billion revenues Mr. Lawsky\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive enforcement generated.\n\nPromontory is run by Eugene Ludwig, connected to a rival power center in the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x94he was Bill Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s law-school classmate and a top U.S. bank regulator in the Clinton administration.\n\nNow you know why banking CEOs and lawyers in New York are in full gossip mode. The battle here smacks at least partly of rival networks of Democratic fixers fighting over a regulatory protection racket.\n\nRegulatory actions against banks began in response to public demand for villains after the 2008 financial crisis. Now they have morphed into institutionalized revenue grabs. Every few months seems to come another \xe2\x80\x9csettlement\xe2\x80\x9d of real or imagined sins, in which billions are transferred from bank shareholders to the federal government and state treasuries. Gov. Cuomo himself has jokingly called the windfalls \xe2\x80\x9ca gift from above.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlong the way, lesser sums land in the pockets of lawyers and revolving-door fixers who attend the racket, not to mention the campaign kitties of influential legislators. Promontory, with its retinue of advisers including Securities and Exchange Commission ex-chiefs Arthur Levitt Jr. and Mary Schapiro, is said to have earned $54.5 million for its work with Standard Chartered. Maybe this figure caught Mr. Lawsky\xe2\x80\x99s eye when he decided to hang out his own shingle.\n\nAll this will seem impossibly weedy to some, but banking is risk-taking; without risk-taking, there is no investment and no growth. Bureaucratic overkill inevitably has become a factor in our slow-growth recovery.\n\nIf a bank makes a loan and the loan goes bad, regulators may come with charges of fraud. If a bank makes a loan and the loan doesn\xe2\x80\x99t go bad, regulators may find it was too profitable at the expense of some protected minority class or other, as seen in the \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate impact\xe2\x80\x9d crackdown on banks that provide wholesale backing for loans auto dealers make to their customers.\n\nIf a bank takes on a new client, the bank can be liable if the client engages in a verboten transaction. As part of its settlement with Standard Chartered, the New York regulator insisted on being consulted on every new demand deposit (i.e., checking account) opened by the New York branch. You can bet New York isn\xe2\x80\x99t taking responsibility for culling out worrisome customers but will jump on Standard Chartered with more fines if any turn up after the fact.\n\nSo the biggest conflict of interest may be between the American people\xe2\x80\x94their notions of freedom, their hopes of prosperity\xe2\x80\x94and a regulatory state that increasingly operates to benefit itself.': 14, 'Paywalled, of course.

Both goals needed bitcoin to grow: the holders needed Visa-level adoption and millions of new investors to lift the price, while the State-haters dreamed of it replacing the dollar and other national currencies.  \n\nHaving those and several other goals (often contradictory) tacked onto it did great harm to the project.  They are "wrong" goals in many ways: some because they are harmful in themselves, to individuals or to the society; some because bitcoin\'s design is far from optimal for them; and some because there are already better solutions than bitcoin.  \n\nThe latter is the case of those goals that *require* adoption to grow to hundreds of millions of users through "offchain bitcoin".  The "bitcoiners" who keep all their bitcoin in Coinbase or Circle (or in the LN, if and when that gets invented) obviously don\'t care about the BP; therefore they could as well use Paypal or Visa.  These and other traditional payment methods are good enough for the soccer moms.  On-chain bitcoin is definitely not good for soccer moms, and "Coinbase bitcoin" is still a lot worse than Paypal.   \n\nAnd, of course, there is no way that "Coinbase bitcoin," even if it grows to a billion users, will ever be a threat to the State or the banks.': 2, "It's something lol ": 0, 'Not if there is no infrastructure to support that transition.': 3, 'But why would the "man in the street" use Coinbase, rather than PayPal, credit cards, bank wires, etc.?
