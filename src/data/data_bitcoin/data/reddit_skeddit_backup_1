When selling, any gains are taxable capital gains.\n\nB can transfer a gift back to A, same gift tax rules apply.\n\ne.g. A buys 1 BTC for $200. A gives it to B. B sells it for $400. B has ($400-$200)=$200 taxable capital gains income (say 25% tax or $50). B gives the $400 to A, but B still owes the $50 tax. A has no taxes.\n\nThis assumed short-term capital gains. Rates would be less if long-term.\n\nThis is a common way to reduce taxes, because if you gift capital assets to someone in a lower tax bracket, they pay less taxes.  If A and B are in the same tax bracket, there is no benefit.\n\nFor example, say I am in a higher tax bracket and I want to give my lower-income relative a gift. I could give them the 1 BTC that I paid $200, they can sell it for $400. Since they are in a low-tax bracket , they'd pay less taxes on the gains.
