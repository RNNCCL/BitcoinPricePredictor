This is also known as an M-of-N scheme, where N is the total number of keys and M is the threshold of signatures required for validation. For example, a 2-of-3 multi-signature is one where three public keys are listed as potential signers and at least two of those must be used to create signatures for a valid transaction to spend the funds. At this time, standard multi-signature scripts are limited to at most 15 listed public keys, meaning you can do anything from a 1-of-1 to a 15-of-15 multi-signature or any combination within that range.\n\nMulti-sig is also very useful as a "zero-trust escrow" for example: let\'s say you are the seller of an item and you go to bitescrow.org you then setup a 2 of 2 transaction where you insert your multi-sig key and then you give the buyer the transaction invite code which allows the buyer to add his key and an address to send the payment to. the payment is then held in this escrow account until the buyer receives the item. Assuming the buyer is happy with the transaction then both the buyer and seller will both sign the transaction with their keys which releases the coins from the escrow 2 of 2 multi-sig address to the sellers Bitcoin address. Technically the buyer could screw over the seller by not signing the transaction after receiving them item but this wouldn\'t be beneficial to the buyer as he/she would not be able to take back the funds in the escrow address as it would require BOTH buyer and sellers multi-dig keys.': 2, 'Multi-sig means that multiple people need to approve a transaction before the money can be spent.\n\nOff chain transactions are where two people might have money deposited in a bitcoin bank, and the bitcoin bank allows them to do internal transfers between accounts.

The only on-chain transactions would be the deposit and the withdrawal.\n\nThe one benefit of off-chain transactions is that Bitcoin currently cannot support a large number of transactions (tops ONLY about 4,000 transactions every 10 minutes, def. not enough for a world wide network, so the only way to go now to scale is having services with lots of transactional volume go off-chain)\n\nThe risk, is that the service holding the bitcoins can get hacked, or can run away with the bitcoins (like Mt.Gox)': 2, 'who is Zach, and why does he want our bitcoins.': 1, "Are you after a technical explanation or just a high level overview from a user's perspective?": 2, 'I slice pizza into three.

However the setup doesn\'t transfer well to mobile, this is something we are working to fix as a priority.\n\nThe other area we are going to fix is expaining what everything is with clear instructions on what to do with everything on the site.\n\nNinki, if anything, is a bit too secure for its own good at the moment :0\n\nTo answer your question about contacts and invoices, to add a contact you need to enter their user name in the chrome app and then exchange "validation phrases" via email or chat, or if you are both in person with the apps you can add with a QR code scan.\n\nYou are then able to send bitcoins without ever seeing addreses and create invoices for each other.\n\nThe irony is, once you have Ninki setup and working I think it is a great experience, but we have a hell of a lot of work to do in terms of setup.\n\nWe have targeted a June release for the improvements I have outlined, I hope you will check us out then...\n\nCheers\nBen\n': 6}, ('I would like to see Blockchain.info implement a feature to generate offline transactions from watched addresses', 21): {'You post on every single Blockchain.info thread, so one assumes... :)': 1, "I don't consider this spam.

No thank you.': 8, "Note that using an exchange as a coin mixer in this way has the same shortcomings as any centralized mixing service like [Helix by Grams](http://grams7enufi7jmdl.onion/helix) (Tor-only .onion link) - the service itself has full knowledge of the connection between the addresses. Depending on your threat model, if you are concerned about the potential for your adversary to, say, subpoena the service you use to mix your coins, or even to hack them in order to discover such a link, then using a centralized exchange is not a great way to maintain your privacy.\n\nThere are some advantages and disadvantages to using an exchange for this purpose as opposed to a service like the aforementioned Helix. The most significant disadvantages are that an exchange is much more likely to maintain logs and transaction histories for their users (in fact they would be irresponsible not to), and that they are also (generally) easily subjected to legal procedures like subpoenas. In the case of a pseudonymously-operated mixer like Helix, on the other hand, the operator's identity is unknown and they are therefore essentially immune to legal compulsion of this type. Additionally, a service dedicated to obscuring coin taint is much more likely to wipe any relevant logs that might allow the addresses to become associated in the future. However, one could also argue that a service like Helix is more likely to be targeted for surveillance by state actors, although I personally think that the major exchanges are also a high-priority surveillance target for these purposes.\n\nAll told, using **any** kind of centralized service to obscure coin taint has some serious flaws, though it can be better than nothing (it can also be worse). Potential alternatives to such a method might include technologies like [JoinMarket](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2rwkfx/joinmarket_coinjoin_that_people_will_actually_use/) or [CoinShuffle](http://crypsys.mmci.uni-saarland.de/projects/CoinShuffle/), both of which are still in early development, or using Tor to access a service like [Coin4Coin](https://www.coin4coin.net/static/) and perform two or more exchanges into and out of alternative cryptocurrencies, preferably including one or more that have some stronger privacy protections than Bitcoin. This will completely sever any blockchain-based connection between the two addresses (but concerns about the service itself knowing the connection will still exist).\n\nUnfortunately, good protections against coin taint are still in their infancy - this is, in my opinion, one of the major unsolved problems with Bitcoin today.

This means that people across the region will soon have access to a software platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies and digital commodities with traditional banking integration.\n\n> Bitt co-founders Gabriel Abed and Oliver Gale say their plan is to have digital currencies stand side by side with traditional currencies throughout the Caribbean in the not too distant future. Following the company\xe2\x80\x99s official launch, bitcoin, the world\xe2\x80\x99s first decentralised digital currency, will become accessible to citizens across the region, including the estimated 60 per cent who are currently unbanked, or under banked.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cWe serve the international market but are focused and centred on the Caribbean offering the core services of mobile digital wallets, international remittances and e-commerce merchant solutions utilising new software called bitcoin and blockchain,\xe2\x80\x9d Gale, the company\xe2\x80\x99s CFO said.\n\n> Bitt, which is based in Hastings, Barbados, is offering a system that is completely branded, built, designed and managed in the Caribbean. The company provides high tech systems at a fraction of the cost of the money transfer systems currently used in the region. \n\n> Gabriel Abed, the company\xe2\x80\x99s CEO, is  of the view that traditional legacy financial systems are outdated.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cThey have huge buildings and many employees. They have paper systems, centralised management ledgers,\xe2\x80\x9d Gale said.\n\n> Abed explained: \xe2\x80\x9cEverything you can pay for in cash, I can pay for in bitcoin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n> Abed\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in the world of digital currency was a natural progression from his educational pursuits. A graduate of the University of Ontario, Institute of Technology with a Bachelors degree in Information Technology majoring in Network Security, his professional qualifications cover cryptography, software development and intrusion detection systems.\n\n> Abed was introduced to cryptocurrencies in early 2010 during his undergrad studies but over the past 12 years, he has been leading software development innovations in the region as part of a team of dedicated developers.\n\n> His business partner, Gale, followed a different academic route, earning an honours degree in accounting and management from the University of Bristol. He was introduced to Bitcoin in 2012 and immediately immersed himself in the field,combining his knowledge of traditional finance with a growing knowledge of digital finance.\n\n> At present, Bitt is run by an eight-member team, headed by Abed and Gale, as well as three advisers: Peter Tod, Barry Gale QC and Jeremy Stephen. Once the company is fully implemented, users will be able to sign up to log on to bitt.com, follow the instructions and immediately start accepting bitcoin from anyone around the world.\n\n> The system is being introduced in response to the need for a better payment systems in the region to reduce the high costs and red-tape associated with traditional electronic payment systems.\n\n> According to a recent ECLAC (Economic Commission of Latin America and the Caribbean) report, the Caribbean needs to lower the cost of remittance services. Digital currencies represent a potential option for doing just that.\n\n> Abed and Gale were in Port-of-Spain last week for a meeting organised by ECLAC involving regulators and representatives of digital currency companies. The talks were aimed at developing a framework for regulation of the system.\n\n> At the meeting, held at ECLAC\xe2\x80\x99s sub-regional headquarters for the Caribbean on March 12, Caribbean experts in the field of digital currency reviewed the opportunities and risks associated with that type of currency.\n\n> They also addressed the potential impact digital currencies may have on sectors such as banking, e-commerce and remittance and whether its use can enable improvements to electronic and mobile-based payment systems and low-cost remittance services.\n\n> ECLAC plans to review national policies in anticipation of the use of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, as well as technologies in the field of digital payments, to determine how they will impact the region. \n\n> Gale and Abed said there are some challenges in the implementation of the system, including lack of e-commerce-supporting legislation, inadequate technical capability and difficulties working with some local banks, but they are determined to get over those hurdles. In T&T, the enabling legislation is relatively new, and is primarily focused on electronic payments for government systems.\n\n> However, widespread use of mobile-phones in the region and easy availability to facilitate financial payments or transactions through short message service (SMS) messages and other widely available systems, means there is scope for acceptance and use of digital currencies within a relatively short space of time.\n\n> Bitcoin uses cryptography-based block-chain technology. At the core of the system is a ledger that can be used to transfer title of ownership to units of digital currency. It is largely self regulating, with features built into the protocol that provide consumer protection and traceability.\n\n> The Bitt co-founders are optimistic that within a matter of months consumers in several parts of the region will be accessing bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s fully automated, transferable management ledger.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cWe are riding a technology wave with finance that is cutting costs, making it faster, making it cheaper, making it possible for people outside of the banking systems to control their money using their mobile phones,\xe2\x80\x9d said Abed.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cOur company will provide a regulated environment for these global services in a compliant way.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\xe2\x80\x8b> What is bitcoin?\n\n> Bitcoin is an online payment system invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, who published his invention in 2008, and released it as open-source software in 2009.\n\n> The system is peer-to-peer; users can transact directly without needing an intermediary. Transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the block chain. The ledger uses its own unit of account, also called bitcoin.\n\n> The system works without a central repository or single administrator, which has led the US Treasury to categorise it as a decentralised virtual currency. Bitcoin is often called the first cryptocurrency, although prior proposals existed. Bitcoin is more correctly described as the first decentralised digital currency. It is the largest of its kind in terms of total market value.\n\n> Bitcoins are created as a reward for payment processing work in which users offer their computing power to verify and record payments into the public ledger.\n\n> This activity is called mining and is rewarded by transaction fees and newly created bitcoins. Besides mining, bitcoins can be obtained in exchange for fiat money, products, and services.\n\n> Users can send and receive bitcoins for an optional transaction fee.\n\n> Bitcoin as a form of payment for products and services has grown, and merchants have an incentive to accept it because fees are lower than the two to three per cent typically imposed by credit card processors.\n\n> Despite a big increase in the number of merchants accepting bitcoin, the cryptocurrency doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have much momentum in retail transactions. Unlike credit cards, any fees are paid by the purchaser, not the vendor.\n\n> The European Banking Authority and other sources have warned that bitcoin users are not protected by refund rights or chargebacks.\n\n> The use of bitcoin by criminals has attracted the attention of financial regulators,legislative bodies, law enforcement, and media.\n\n> They listed money laundering, financing of illicit activities, theft, fraud, tax evasion, and use in black markets as possible.\n\n> As of 2013, the criminal activities centered around theft and black markets. Officials in countries such as the United States also recognised that bitcoin can provide legitimate financial services to customers.': 5, 'I am Gabriel Abed and I will write a blog on where we have come and what we will be doing in the near future.

Those investors are required to hold on to their BIT shares for a minimum of 12 months before they're allowed to sell them on the open market --which will now be facilitated using GBTC on the OTC Market(s). Therefore, those existing BIT shareholders are the sole source of initial liquidity for all GBTC trading. This situation may lead to a *very* inactive GBTC market if nobody with BIT shares wants to sell.\n\nCOIN, on the other hand, has exactly 200k coins that will be split into exactly one million shares in their IPO -- each share representing 1/5 off a bitcoin. Nobody owns any of those shares yet, so they'll all be instantly available once trading begins on NASDAQ.\n\nPlease correct me if I'm wrong! :)": -1, "No, both instruments will be buying BTC on the open market to back new shares.

The Shares have been qualified for public trading on the OTCQX U.S. Premier marketplace. While the Sponsor hopes to establish an active public market for the Shares, such a market may not develop or be sustained. As a result, investors may not be able to sell their Shares quickly or at the market price if trading in the Shares is not active. **If a public market does develop, the number of Shares available for sale is, at least initially, anticipated to be limited.** Therefore, the price of the Shares may be volatile. \n\nIt goes on to describe the limitations on initial liquidity I was referring to above:  \n\n>Furthermore, at this time, the Sponsor is not accepting redemption requests from Shareholders. As such, until an active secondary market develops, **and a holder has held its Shares for at least one year**, or the Trust is permitted to, and does, reinstate a Share redemption program, investors will be unable to (or could be significantly impeded in attempting to) sell or otherwise liquidate investments in the Shares, which could have a material adverse impact on an investment in the Shares. Investors should consider an investment in the Shares to be an illiquid investment and should invest only if prepared to hold the Shares indefinitely.  \n\n**As of 31 December 2014, all 1,382,400 existing issued/outstanding shares were already held by 184  investors.**\n\nThose already owned shares account for BIT's total bitcoin holdings (138,240 BTC).\n\nAs I said, those shareholders are meant to be the supply for the initial sales of GBTC. If no current holder sells, *then and only then* will BIT consider issuing a new basket (100 new shares) to be sold at market price -- which would require them to simultaneously buy 10 BTC on the open markets to add to their bitcoin reserves.\n\nAs you can see, the GBTC fund will work in a completely different way than COIN will since GBTC is based on a private Trust that already exists.\n\nCOIN, on the other hand, will act like a true IPO with 1,000,000 shares available to traders on day one.\n\nJust as I tried to tell you before...": 1, 'If the public market does NOT materialize then yes, the existing shareholders might have trouble liquidating.
