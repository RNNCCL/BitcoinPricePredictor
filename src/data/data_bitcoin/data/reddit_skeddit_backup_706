At that point your keys don\'t fit the lock to that coin anymore.\n\nDoes that make sense?

Your "wallet" is constantly checking for any bitcoin labled as \'sent\' to you, see\'s the new lables, and updates your balance. \n\nI know...

All the technological effort on top of that goes into establishing agreement between everyone about how much of it each person owns, maintaining security, and preventing anyone from cheating.\n\nIf you just want to start using it without digging into the underlying tech, the key things to understand would be that bitcoin "exists" in the *blockchain* (which everyone can see, and says how many coins are in each *address*), that each address has a *public* identifier that anyone can send coins to and a *private key* (like a password, but it\'s a really long secret number) that needs to be used to spend those coins. A *wallet* stores those keys so that you can access the coins in your address(es), and handles the busy-work of issuing transactions for you.\n\nChangetip is a useful little service that sets up an wallet on your behalf - you can send coins to that address, and the bot has the keys so it can manage the coins according to your instructions (in the form of messages on reddit/twitter/wherever else it extends to now), including sending them to other addresses.': 5, 'The sidebar links have a lot of the foundational information that can help you understand it better.

The distinction is most obvious in the antiquated gold-backed scenario, where you have banknotes and coins (currency) versus bullion (which is money but not currency).\n\nThere is no such distinction in Bitcoin because the commodity itself is directly transferable without resorting to an intermediary currency instrument, therefore the bitcoin itself always is both the money and the currency.
