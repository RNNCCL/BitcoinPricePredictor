Third key is held by bitgo.\n\nWhen you want to make a tx, you sign using your hot wallet key and then send to bitgo for countersigning with the third key. Bitgo then authenticates your request through SMS/google authenticator, then signs and broadcast the tx. \n\nAn attacker that compromises your hot wallet thus, in theory, cannot spend your funds, because he needs your mobile device for 2FA. Alternately he can break into your offline backup key. \n\nWhat I'm not clear about is the procedure for 2FA recovery, i.e. recovery when the google authenticator secret is lost / you have lost control of a certain phone number. If you can reset the phone number through your account, then there isn't really 2FA. But I don't see any other way to prove your identity, since they do not perform identity verification.\n\n": 2, "A hacker compromising BitGo has one key available and can try to brute force the user given password  (read: often very low entropy, seldomly randomly generated) encrypting the second private key held by BitGo\n\nThe hacker doesn't even have to do that, he can change the javascript going to the browser to steal keys nullifying the multisig": 2, 'So you are saying there is no reasonable improvement with respect with other online wallets?': 1, "Ben Davenport from BitGo here.\n\nBitGo does provide significantly increased security vs. any single-key system because multi-sig allows us to eliminate single points of failure.\n\nLet's take the case of a Blockchain wallet (not picking on them in particular, just the nature of single-key). All of the keys necessary to transfer bitcoin are present on your client machine. They could be stolen directly by an evil browser extension, or indirectly through key-logging malware that captures your primary (and secondary) password. Or, someone who hacks your email, can access your Blockchain backups and attack the encryption key offline.\n\nIn comparison, malware which steals your user key or encryption password for a BitGo account still has only managed to capture 1 out of the 2 keys required to produce a valid signed transaction. BitGo holds the 2nd active key and requires successful 2FA through Authy before co-signing a transaction. The 3rd (backup) key is held (by the user in most cases) entirely offline.\n\nFor our multi-user wallets (currently an Enterprise-only feature), further validation may be required before BitGo co-signs a transaction. For example, Alice and Bob are both admins on a multi-user BitGo wallet, with a spending limit set to 1 BTC per transaction and 5 BTC per day. Alice and Bob together share 1 active user key. If a 10 BTC transaction is submitted to BitGo through Alice's account, BitGo will not co-sign immediately. Bob would be required to login to his BitGo account, pass 2FA, and approve the transaction. Only after that, would BitGo co-sign the transaction.\n\nOne commenter mentioned 2FA reset as a threat vector. In the case where 2FA access is lost, we take a risk-based approach, depending on the size of the balance. We prefer to weight security over convenience of access. Since the user holds 2 keys and can recover funds independent of BitGo, BitGo can take a very conservative approach about allowing 2FA to be reset.

If the velocity or supply increases, the inflation ,  takes place. If velocity decreases, the currency tends towards deflation or stagnation. So lets propose a series of scenarios. \n\n1.THE BAD  There is a rapid period of inflation because everyone is spending their bitcoins. Since there in inflation (currency is de-valued), there is little incentive to hold on to any savings and therefore velocity will increase driving a constant cycle of inflation. However, this can be offset by more goods being in the market, the more goods that are available and desired that can be exchange for bitcoin,  given that bitcoin has a finite supply, the more bitcoin will be worth. The only problem with this model is that if i get into bitcoin and purchase some with a fiat currency, I have to spend it quickly so that the value will not go away. \n       This would create a disincentive to bring goods to market and accept bitcoin, because I would have to spend my revenue right away or it would lose value. therefore, the only way to combat inflation (currency de-valuation) is to bring more goods to the bitcoin market, an activity with a heavy disincentive. \n\n2. THE GOOD Few people are spending their bitcoins. This would tend to lead to a deflationary condition in which the remaining bitcoins in circulation would rise in value. This would provide incentive for me to bring goods to market and accept bitcoin, driving further deflation (currency goes up in value). As the currency goes up in value, there are more people in the market and deflation continues at a more rapid pace. as long as population continues to increase and demand for good increases, this deflation will continue and held bitcoins will increase in value.  \n\nMy point is that once bit coin sees any sort of real inflation, it may be doomed.

Banks said just get your cash from a machine near your house using this card and it will be easier than getting cash from here every time.  Then once a person had the debit card and they realized that shops would take it, they started using it instead of cash.  ATMs were a huge factor in people switching over from cash/checks to debit/credit cards.  I think the same will be for bitcoin.  We need those ATMs on the ground everywhere.

To me, I see bitcoin more as a protocol to efficient transfer value, but that doesn\'t make it a currency with the traditional sense. Also, the fact that can appreciate or depreciate rapidly doesn\'t make it a great currency. I prefer to use a currency like the dollar that has the property of slow and steady depreciation. If I knew that the dollar could appreciate a lot, I would want to spend it.\n\n> Bitcoin is much more efficient at everything and the only thing holding it back is the uncertainty of the regulation.\n\nI agree that this has hurt price appreciation in the short term, but once there is some reasonable regulation that passes, more companies will be free to get involved.\n\n> Once the market cap approaches 40 Billion it will become very stable.\n\nI am not sure about that, give that for example Gold has trillions of dollars of market cap and it\'s still very unstable. The traditional fiat currencies are only stable because they are specifically manipulated by the central banks.

Google my username if you want to check out my background / business.\n\nI just try not to look through rose-coloured glasses.  Bitcoin has not yet come close to making a major impact on the financial sector.  It has plenty of challenges to overcome, and it is certainly not a foregone conclusion that it will reach the adoption levels of the internet / email.  While there are examples of technology that have been widely successful, there are countless more that have not.\n\nBitcoin needs to become more friendly to the average user to become successful.  I don't think anyone can argue this fact.  We aren't there yet.  Bitcoin does not yet provide the average person with enough utility to reach mass adoption.\n\nI believe that it can hit mass adoption, but plenty more innovation is needed.  The main issues that I outlined are that for consumers, a Bitcoin transaction is actually two transactions.  One to buy the Bitcoins, another to buy the item with the Bitcoins.  The challenges lie in making this two-step process easier than other transactions, which are essentially one-step processes for the consumer.\n\nTo give an example of services that have turned a two-step process into a simple transaction: credit cards.  When you make a purchase with a credit card, you are actually taking a loan from Visa / Mastercard, and then Visa / Mastercard pay the merchant.

Bitcoin is the product, not a tool as it had effectively no usefulness. The problem being that you should not want a currency to be valuable/the product itself, currency alone does nothing, has no use in production/advancement, and simply shouldn\'t be held on its own, rather it should be invested/utilized - stemming from which are many of bitcoin\'s fundamental failings as a "currency".\n\n>As I told your DUMB ASS from the start, I would be all in favor of the US dollar and ANY currency expanding IF equal units were simply given to all citizens equally.

The first being someone from the ages of 16 to 25 with no real accomplishments or knowledge of your own, so you imagine pretending to have it will suddenly make it so. The second being some washed out 26-40 year old hoping to live vicariously through a fake internet persona. \n\nAssuming you were 63 or well off, god help you, you sad, sad little man that you 1 think that it would validate *anything* you say and 2 that you\'re pitiful enough that you need to come on to the internet to validate yourself.\n\nAs for giving you financial advice based on my own mistakes, I\'m not stupid enough to have ever touched bitcoin.

It\'s not like btc has any underlying value or any practical use.\n\nAnd you clearly don\'t understand sovereign debt, if I could borrow the amounts of money the us gov can, under the terms that they can, for the purposes that they do, at the interest rates that they do, I\'d be trillions in debt as well and sitting pretty.\n\n>Good luck with your trolling and I hope one day you can look back and realize how your campaigning was just contributing to a status quo that benefits the ultra rich at the expense of the very poor.  I hope you realize that was just wrong and I also hope you genuinely feel sorry for it.  I doubt you will though as you seem like an egomaniac to me.\n\nBitcoin solely benefits the few hundred individuals with substantial holdings who can pump up the price and then dump it prior to crash. *Everyone* else, the poor, middle income, the ones not in on the ponzi scheme etc. are entirely and unilaterally fucked. Even then, the speculators who stay in will get fucked all the same one day.\n\nThe real world economy is infinitely better than bitcoin\'s fake one.

Actually it\'s not absurd--IT\'S FUCKING DISINGENUOUS!\n\nI\'m speaking to you from the very literal historical and practical effects of deflation. I don\'t care if you don\'t like it. I don\'t care if you\'re too much of an idiot to understand it. In practice, your real wealth won\'t increase. In practice, there are a huge number of negative results of deflation. In practice, there\'s very little to like. \n\nYou have... what? "I think it will be like this so it will"? Your feelings? Surprisingly, the economy doesn\'t work based off your feelings.\n\n> What you WILL see is people loaning money at a fixed interest rate of 1-5% and THAT will be a good damn return. \n\nDid you just make those numbers up randomly? Do you even know what you\'re *trying* to say? Did you consider the fact that deflation in its own right increases the real costs of interest and debt etc. whereas inflation decreases it?\n\nFixed interest rates? Do you even know how interest is calculated? And sure, lenders will make a killing, at the expense of all consumer, business, and government borrowers stifling growth, investment, consumer spending etc. etc. etc. \n\n> Also, homeowners will sell their homes themselves and offer shares for their houses rather than going through a bank(what the fuck is the point really).\n\nWhat the fuck is this? Offer shares for their houses? Where on earth did you pull that from?\n\nBuyers go through banks because they don\'t have the liquidity to purchase a house outright. Do you really not understand that? It\'s also cheaper to purchase a house through debt. Do you know what the time value of money is?\n\n> The upshot is there will be less debt with MORE personal wealth for individuals.\n\nThe only ones who will profit from deflation will be lenders, at the expense of all other business and consumer interests. Then as businesses suffer, through the process I described, your wealth will fall as well. Lenders get richer, everyone else gets poorer (and then eventually, so will the lenders), that\'s the future of the world you\'ve envisioned.\n\n> I\'m sorry the FACT the United States went off the gold standard in the 70s has produced the greatest income disparity between the rich and poor that we\'ve ever seen has escaped you. \n\nThe gold standard hasn\'t existed in practice since the \'30s.\n\nYou can ALWAYS tell someone who is completely ignorant with regards to finance/economics when they mention the gold standard in a positive light. The gold standard was hilariously bad for the economy, causing intense economic volatility/instability and counter to your wild and baseless claims, generally aided serious wealth disparity. Even worse, major economic players/individuals had the ability to directly influence/manipulate the economy through their direct ownership and acquisition of gold. \n\nGetting off the gold standard was a long overdue evolution in finance which has had significant positive impacts across the world. I understand you\'re some kind of strangely contradictory Luddite, but we\'ve progressed beyond swapping goats for sheep, we\'ve progressed from swapping hard specie for goods and services, and for the most part we\'ve progressed from hard currency.

You don\'t have the ability to understand anything any deeper. What you also fail to understand is that "charts" can and almost always are extremely misleading. Of course, you would both have to understand the topic as well as statistics to get why most charts are misleading (not that I expect you to).. bringing me to the next point... \n\n> then again, you\'d chalk it up to just some odd correlation \n\nDon\'t make it my problem that you don\'t understand statistics. 90% of academic and policy economics is statistics, your lack of understanding is a critical part of your ignorance with regards to this topic. In fact general misunderstandings with regards to statistics is a huge cause for concern among the economics community, leading to misguided little opinions like yours and misguided little ventures like bitcoin. \n\n> because you\'re a nimrod of the highest caliber that can\'t put 1 and 1 together if 2 was the only choice.\n\nWell, I guess I shouldn\'t expect more from the type to buy so wholeheartedly into a nonsense ponzi scheme.

You\'ve made it your idol, you\'ve become so conceited and absolutely deluded by the thought that you have some kind of privileged information or edge over people who know more than you - so then you say idiocy like "explain these things to you in terms your toddler brain can understand" and "open your mind to economic theory that opposes your bigotry" and "I\'ll try not to be condescending" - you know, the kind of thing your average little shit would say.

When currency is inflationary, society will hold greater value in credit and less in money. These credit instruments, due to their risky nature, are more volatile. When the market becomes risk averse, it may rapidly pull out of credit instruments and back into money.\n\nThis will take some time to pick apart as it\'s just so very off. \n\nLet\'s start with some critical points. \n\n- Deflation increases the cost/value of debt over time.\n\n- Credit is not a bad thing. In fact, credit is a very good thing, a fundamentally positive evolution in finance which allows growth, investment, expansion, acquisition, and simply a much higher level of financial operations at every level than you can ever possibly have with a pure cash/direct money system. It significantly expands what a given amount of money or a given market can achieve. \n\n- Credit and cash are not direct substitutes, there are a variety of reasons for using one or the other. They are not the same thing and do not carry the same implications/results. \n\n- Given time value of money, debt financing can often be a cheaper and more effective option than most other means of project financing. \n\nSo understanding these, I\'ll try to deconstruct your first paragraph. \n\n> Liquid credit instruments and money are substitutes\n\nLike I said, these are not direct substitutes, there are reasons and implications that arise from using one or the other. \n\n> but credit instruments can default, reducing their nominal and real value\n\nWhat on earth does this mean? How does it apply to this situation? When offering or taking credit options, there is a risk of default on the party taking the credit option, that\'s one thing interest is calculated to cover. What exactly are you trying to prove by mentioning something that\'s simply an element of credit transactions? What does nominal and real value have to do with anything?\n\n> When currency is inflationary, society will hold greater value in credit and less in money.\n\nYes, in one sense you have the right idea. Inflation reduces the real value/cost of debt. Part of the positive results of low levels of inflation is that it reduces the cost of debt/credit financing, allowing, as I mentioned above, a much higher level of financial operations at every level as well as cheaper and higher levels of growth, expansion, investment etc. \n\nHolding money in itself does NOTHING. It just sits there, you don\'t want people hoarding/sitting on their money. Currency is meant to be used (consumption, debt financing, investment etc.), it does no one any good to sit on it. Money under your bed is money wasted. \n\n> These credit instruments, due to their risky nature, are more volatile.\n\nFor one thing, deflation/inflation have little to no impact on whether an individual company/individual is likely to default. So there\'s almost no relation here. \n\nSecond, if anything, credit financing etc. is FAR less risky with low levels of inflation as the cost/value of debt falls with time. \n\nThird, you are incorrectly and inaccurately directly conflating risk and volatility. They are not quite the same thing. Potential volatility can be a risk for a company/economic situation, but in a credit transaction,  that is accounted for through interest. Conversely, direct cash transactions can be of higher risk to a company/for the market than credit transactions. Risk is a very complex topic and the definition/impact can change rapidly depending on circumstances. \n\n> When the market becomes risk averse\n\nThe market/investors are theoretically assumed to always risk averse, just to different degrees. \n\n> it may rapidly pull out of credit instruments and back into money.\n\nNow you\'re missing/misunderstanding a lot of elements of this situation leading back to the whole - inflation/deflation/credit/debt financing/investment interplay. First, you don\'t explain anything of the relationship/progression which leads to markets suddenly "pulling out of credit instruments and back into money."\n\nSo I\'ll try to figure out what you were trying to say.  Presumably this is all supposed to come as a result of a transition to deflationary currency. I\'ll explain what actually happens in this situation. You\'re very partly right, mostly wrong. \n\n- Deflation increases the real value/cost of debt. \n\n- Deflation theoretically increases the value of currency holdings over time. (BTW, I won\'t touch on everything that happens as a result of deflation, just how it applies to to  your questions, there are a large variety of other dynamics that play a role.)\n\nNow, where your right is that deflation causes businesses/individuals to draw back from credit purchases/transactions/investments. Where you\'re wrong is the reason, it doesn\'t have to do with relative volatility, it has everything to do with an increase in the cost of debt financing. It\'s now more expensive to pursue credit/debt financing. The result of this being a higher threshold for return/costing on projects and purchases which simultaneously slows growth/investment on the part of businesses as well as consumer spending on the part of the individual. both of which are very bad for the economy. \n\nSecond, the fact that currency is increasing in value rather than slowly decreasing in value stifles investment, not just debt financing. Part of the reasons people invest currency is because you will gain a better/real return for your money through an investment than you will just sitting on it. Now currency is increasing in value, rather than losing 1-3% per year through inflation, you\'re gaining 1-3% per year through deflation. In turn, investment falls, perhaps drastically, as any projects which return less than that are now less viable than risklessly and simply holding currency and there is simply a general lack of need or impetus to invest. Your holdings will be the same or greater ten years from now, why protect them by investing? As a result of declining investment, businesses suffer and thus consumers and the economy as a whole suffers. \n\nLike I said, there is NO VALUE for the economy in simply holding money. You aren\'t helping anything, you aren\'t growing the economy, you aren\'t giving money to those who actually will use is to grow/expand/produce. Holding currency is BAD, both for you and the economy. Incentivizing people to hold currency (or as you put it " pull out of credit instruments and back into money") rather than the opposite is a unilaterally bad thing which will have significant adverse impacts on the economy assuming anything like this ever happened. \n\n- **Again, remember that there are a large variety of other dynamics that play a role in these types of issues as well as a large variety of additional reasons why inflation is better than deflation. I am just addressing your questions/statements directly.** \n\n> When currency is deflationary, people never need to flee currency and move into credit markets, so you will see less severe increases and decreases in the size of the credit market. Since currency and credit are substitutes, that means less volatility in the price of money.\n\nNow, understanding all of the above, we can get to why low levels of deflation is more volatile policy than low levels of inflation. Also, increasing/decreasing the size of the credit market and its effects is a relation which you neither prove nor discuss, currency and credits aren\'t perfect substitutes, and people unfortunately pursue less debt *as well as* less investment (both are bad). \n\n- Fist is the simple fact that consistent, low levels of deflation are far harder to maintain with active monetary policy than inflation. 1-3% inflation is a relatively easy target to maintain for policy makers/central banks. It\'s in turn very difficult to maintain both deflation alone as well as consistent levels of deflation. Simply by the nature of monetary policy. Inconsistent levels/phases of inflation/deflation will have significant and volatile impact on the economy as decision makers can no longer effectively account for/project what inflation/deflation will be at in any given point in the future. In turn, decisions/returns/investment/growth may be very erratic.\n\n- Second, is the fact that through active monetary policy and management of inflation, the central banks actually play a very significant role in directly moderating economic upswings and downswings. With a fixed money supply/deflation they simply don\'t have that ability any longer. Look at historical examples of mad fluctuations in the economy that came in the American economy prior to effective policy on the part of the FED. \n\n- Third, deflation exacerbates economic upswings and downswings. Rising real values of currency make the impact of either far more significant. In turn, inflation takes the edge off of upswings/downswings as does inflationary policy and the monetary policy-making that it allows. (and yes, this is well founded in historical examples) This is more or less the very definition of macroeconomic volatility and has significant adverse effects on the economy as a whole.\n\n- Additionally, as the economy pulls away from investments/credit and debt financing and more towards direct/hard currency transactions through deflation and as businesses lose sources of credit and investment, on a microeconomic level, this will lead to significantly less flexibility in the market and thus less ability to absorb various shocks, and in turn, more volatility. \n\nSo yeah, deflation is bad and leads to a more volatile market. Theory and history agree. \n\n\n\n\n\n': 1, "Is it 60% inflation if the cost of goods buttcoin can purchase has stayed somewhat stable?  \n\nIf the butt price increases and I can buy MORE goods than before, isn't that kinda/sort of deflation?

As the currency is spent, the effect is even greater in an economy.\n\n> Also, the argument that a currency gaining value over time causing people not to spend is just plain silly. The same could be said for goods that gain value over time. Why sell them if they'll be worth more in the future? Stupid.\n\nThis demonstrates you have *no* knowledge of monetary theory/practice (not that I expect too much from /r/Bitcoin). Deflation is bad, understand that. Deflation discourages investment as I mentioned, it reduces production, it leads to higher volatility within the economy, it increases the real value of debt, etc. etc. You're thinking about it as if it's one sided, you may be getting a touch more for your money, but what is the result of that? Businesses get less for their product/costs, resulting in reduced production and significant/varied adverse effects on the economy. Then due to things like downward nominal wage rigidity, business costs don't fall the same. What do you think will eventually happen to your wages? With businesses losing more money or going out of business, they will lay people off/fire people - leading to lower consumer spending/worth - in turn causing more adverse effects for businesses - until you enter a dangerous deflationary spiral. The more competitive labor environment will eventually reduce wages/slow wage growth and sure, you may be able to get a bit more for your money, but you'll have less money and the businesses paying you/servicing you/driving the economy will be fucked. \n\nThen what happens to people/corporations in debt with deflation? Suddenly the value/cost of their debt is rising, in turn hurting consumers and discouraging businesses to invest - how do you think most businesses expand/grow? - through equity or debt... If the cost/value of your debt is rising, the return on your projects is lower and you invest less/lose money - again, fucking the economy. \n\nDeflation also increases economic volatility and reduces the FED/Government's ability to moderate it. Imagine the kind of volatility that would enter many business decisions if you had to determine whether there would be inflation or deflation over the course of your project/investment. Interest rates would fluctuate madly, returns would be unstable, prices both at the business and consumer level would go wild, and as a whole, the entire economic environment would suffer. Low levels of inflation are very easy to maintain, and make it much simpler and much more stable for businesses/consumers to make decisions. \n\nThere are very relevant and very real world examples of the dangers of deflation found in economic history. I'd suggest you educate yourself on them.\n\n> Another thing, if anyone buys this Keynesian bullshit about constantly creating more money, that's fine, give it to everyone fucking equally. Why should a small group of people be able to create currency at will and debase everyone else's savings?\n\nI get that you're some kind of cool, counterculturalist economist, but Keynesian theory doesn't even exist in practice any more, some derivatives make their way into modern economic policy, but it's not the same. This is simply about practicalities. There's not some grand conspiracy to steal your money and give it to others, that's just daft conspiracy and you should feel ashamed for believing it. \n\n> create currency at will and debase everyone else's savings?\n\nNo one should be holding currency. Currency is for spending/using, not for holding or investing in itself. Don't shove cash into your mattress like a fool, and you'll have no problems.

If it did, we would have SO MANY bigger problems to deal with and would have had SO MANY bigger problems leading up to that point. Not to mention that bitcoin would hilariously never survive the "collapse of the dollar." Bitcoin isn\'t even slightly a reasonable alternative to the dollar. Of course, it\'s unlikely to survive the next two years, so you\'d never have to worry about the eventuality unless Russia starts nuking us in the next six months. \n\nIf the situation progressed to where the dollar *fucking collapse* ( I want you to realize how absurd that is), bitcoin would be the LAST thought for ANYONE trying to find a safe haven for their wealth.

It, very similar to bitcoin, is a highly speculative commodity that makes for a very poor investment for anyone but the speculator lucky (not smart, purely lucky) enough to get in while low and get out before the drop. Gold is a bad investment, it was horrible for the economy when it was tied to the dollar, and thankfully finance has progressed beyond swapping hard specie by a good 100 years or so. It does retain some value over time, but poor relative to the alternatives. It\'s a speculators wet dream and a home for the panic-ridden or misinformed investor. Governments (And I thought you hated governments - I guess if it fits your agenda, anything\'s okay) operate under different priorities, but even they continue to divest themselves of the stuff. \n\nThe difference being that bitcoin is PURELY  (I REPEAT, **PURELY**) speculative.

Let's further examine what a drastic reduction in energy prices would mean for the profitability of mining bitcoin.\n\nFirst we must understand the mining market as it currently exists. The vast majority of processing power in the Bitcoin Network is wielded by few mining pools, running quasi-industrial mining concerns. As the price of Bitcoin fluctuates there is no doubt that industrial mining companies will adjust their level of production accordingly, similar to how traditional mining companies will cease production at certain mines when the price of gold no longer allows profits to be made from extraction. Unlike the traditional mining industry, however, ASIC miners become obsolete relatively quickly, such that even though the price of bitcoin might be temporarily too low to turn a profit, since the ASIC machine is already paid for, and constantly depreciating in value, it still makes sense to operate it until the marginal cost of mining a Bitcoin exceeds the marginal revenue gained from selling it (in dollars). That being said, there are tons of machines out there that are currently sitting idle, either because their processing power is already obsolete, and/or since the local cost of energy is too high to turn a profit mining bitcoin. So what will happen in the mining market if suddenly the price of energy (an input cost) drops substantially? Both industrial mining concerns and private p2p pool miners that were previously unprofitable and were sitting idle will become relatively valuable once more, and will be brought into the market. This will result in massive processing capacity hitting the Bitcoin Network in a short period of time, ratcheting up the mining difficulty until a new equilibrium point as been reached. Who stands the most to gain from a decrease in mining costs? Most certainly the largest mining pools featuring the most efficient miners who consume the most energy in their production of bitcoins. Perhaps some old rigs will be dusted off and plugged in, and their owners will be able to make a little money. Yet the amount of money they make will be small and only for a short period of time.\n\n\n": 1}, ('Satoshi in new Disney movie', 0): {"That character's name is Tadashi.": 3, 'What are you, an idiot?': 2, 'Always knew Satoshi was a virtual self aware entity in a Disney movie.': 1}, ('Bought my first .01 bitcoin today, and boy am I excited!', 15): {'http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/golf-clap.gif': 2, 'so what are you going to buy? or are you hodling?\n': 1, "I believe in money too, it's really an interesting idea\n\nWhat's your setup?
