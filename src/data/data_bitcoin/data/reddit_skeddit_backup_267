You had to go and install the drivers from [floppy disk](http://web.archive.org/web/20010125041300/http://www.hawaii.edu/its/micro/pc/win31/wfwnic.html) before you could connect to the Internet. Because it was hard to install networking drivers, it was hard to start learning how to use the Internet. That was an infrastructure problem. And then, once that infrastructure problem was solved, an enormous new cohort of engineers beyond the [original wizards](http://www.ibiblio.org/pioneers/) had to learn about how to write network-aware code. That was an education problem.\n\n>We think Bitcoin is at a similar stage today. A series of intertwined constraints present a logjam to broader adoption. Part of that logjam involves the fact that downloading the Blockchain and buying a small quantity of bitcoin is even more laborious and time consuming than buying and installing a TCP/IP stack from floppy. That\xe2\x80\x99s an infrastructure problem, and it\'s why we built the [21 Bitcoin Computer](https://medium.com/@21dotco/the-21-bitcoin-computer-1d28d652b57b). Another big part is the fact that beyond the [original wizards](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/People) relatively few people know how to write Bitcoin-aware code. That\xe2\x80\x99s an education problem, and why we\xe2\x80\x99re now writing the 21 Bitcoin Tutorials.\n\n>These tutorials are written and edited by the same folks who brought you the Bitcoin Developer Documentation at bitcoin.org. So they are not short on technical rigor. But they are aimed not at the Bitcoin wizard but at the "average developer" - the person who knows broadly how to code, but comes from a background in another area like graphics or web development rather than cryptography. If you use Github, you should be able to do these tutorials. You\xe2\x80\x99ll learn the basics behind Bitcoin, from digital signatures to how mining works to the format of every major Bitcoin datastructure. Each interactive tutorial includes snippets of code, and more will be released each week. **By the end you should be equipped to navigate the more advanced Bitcoin Developer Documentation. And then you can go off and build smart contracts and autonomous corporations**.\n\n>Many of the tutorials will be easier if you have early access to a 21 Bitcoin Computer, as it has a built-in mining chip to provide an constant stream of satoshis, along with a pre-loaded blockchain and pre-configured software to make it easy to set up Bitcoin-aware clients and servers. But a 21 Bitcoin Computer is only a hard prerequisite for the subset of tutorials that utilize hardware or OS-level features for mining and micropayments. For those of you who don\xe2\x80\x99t have an early access unit yet, you can do the equivalent of installing Bitcoin from floppy disk following the instructions [here](https://21.co/learn/setup-a-bitcoin-development-environment). \n  \n': 34, 'Yeah, thanks for writing this.
