I like the Eye of Providence distributing money.': 1, '> Am I wrong to think it will never be more than 21M*BTC price?\n\nIt\'s a bit of a slippery idea. It is correct that you cannot *today* hold a greater value in BTC than it\'s current market cap (which is the total number of BTC units that exist multiplied by the current BTC unit price).\n\nBut the act of trying to move from a position of having, say, $10billion usd into a position of buying all of the bitcoin that you can will inevitably increase BTC\'s unit price until the market cap is greater than how much you were trying to invest.\n\nBasically, your $10bil USD gets represented in the market as liquid demand, and people will stop selling BTC at low rates if they know you are basically guaranteed to buy it from them even at higher rates. Then once you have it, prior to selling off your act of making BTC harder for ordinary people to get will keep that price pegged fairly high, to boot. Nobody can guarantee you will keep either the market cap in general or your holdings in particular at $10bil USD of value for any specific amount of time (and if you\'re the currency\'s new anchor tenant, then odds would certainly be against you) but you would certainly increase the floor (by quite a lot!) below which unit price is not likely to drop; which in turn would protect at least a large chunk of your input value.\n\nOnce you start to sell off is when things would get the most dicey: your new sell strategy would represent oversupply to the market and you would depress unit price quite a lot, perhaps even below where it started when you began buying, even if no other forces were acting to depress the market. Basically everybody would take on the mindset "Cheap coin? Hooray! If I hold out maybe it will even get cheaper.." and your interest to sell would tend to reward such behavior.\n\nSo at the end of the day, using Bitcoin to transfer value by exchanging from one currency and then exchanging back into another for huge value transfers on par with Bitcoin\'s initial market cap could prove tremendously lossy. This is one of the reasons that increased unit price tends to also increase Bitcoin\'s utility.\n\nBut it\'s still just not a fair representation of what the video literally said, which is that you can transfer any amount of *money* (which in context means "Bitcoin that you already own") to anybody else in the world instantly. That part is still true, and the *transfering* of Bitcoin all by itself has no great impact on it\'s value.

As always, it sounds like "the only way to get into the system" as well as a potential "make money off of my idle gaming rig" red herring.\n\nPlus they talk about mining both being the only pin securing the system and being rewarded by newly minted coin, and then in the next breath confirm that newly minted coin will trickle to a stop which leads any partly functioning mind to assume that mining then has to trickle to a stop which would bottom out system security.\n\nHere are important points I think any of these pitches ought to have. (no, I cannot animate well enough to make my own though lol):\n\n* Downplay the word "mining". Try to call them "notaries" or "book keepers" or some name that emphasizes the contribution they make to the network more than it emphasizes connotations of greed and circumstantial windfall.\n\n* Before even mentioning mining, heavily emphasize Bitcoin\'s use as a currency and touch upon how to get it and how to use it. Buy it with fiat at an exchange, earn it as a wage, by selling items or performing services, spend it to buy things online or at real world shops that accept it. Splatter a brief screen with logos of places you can use bitcoin where people who pause just then can get a nice infographic: Microsoft, Tiger, NewEgg, Overstock, Wordpress, 4chan, Reddit, Almost every hosting and VPS provider on earth, via Gyft and eGifter (under their heading with "via giftcards" subtitle) plaster even more logos like Burger King, Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Home Depot, etc etc.\n\n* Once you get to mining (book keeping), talk about how it secures the network. Book keepers get paid to do their work through thousands of tiny voluntary transaction fees, but while the network is scaling up they also get a **subsidy** of newly minted bitcoin. This subsidy will evaporate as we reach our prescribed 21 mil limit and volume fills in the gaps with the fees from loads of transactions.\n\n* Book Keepers provide this security by voluntarily (and quite profitably!) running data centers full of computing equipment custom-built solely for the purpose of verifying bitcoin transactions. In 2010 any desktop computer could make a difference and earn some cash for their work, but this has become an economy of scale which also speaks to Bitcoin\'s 400 *petahash* (400 thousand million million irreversible hash operations per second) security metric: hundreds of times more computational power than any other purpose-built network of computing power ever built before.\n\n* This video did a pretty decent job clarifying how there is no company or central body that runs anything. That should be part of any such video: nobody can tell you how to spend your money, block your transactions or freeze your balances as long as you keep your own wallet secure (eg: strong passwords, 2FA, backups, multisig and try to keep your PC safe from Malware).\n\n* Disintermediation is great to talk about. This is a new platform that anybody can build new services on and innovate, anywhere across the planet, without having to first seek permission from their incumbent competitors. Instead of a debt network with an entire globe caught up in a web of "why should I trust you to eventually pay me back and settle this debt? Prove yourself to me. I want stool samples and your first born as collateral." it is a positive value network where you push value to anybody you choose, and they can get bullet-proof confirmation in mere minutes that the value has changed hands irreversibly to them.': 3, "I'm impressed.

However there is a strong market desire for it - especially apparent given the consequences for having and producing it - and even if the kids were "consenting" (even if of the age of consent in their area, which in many states is under 18 or using emancipated minors) and fairly compensated for it, that would not change the fact that our general society has decided that this should not be sanctioned.\n\n> Everything is banned until you obtain explicit permission.\n\nLet\'s be clear - we don\'t have a final edition to work with here.

This effect has gotten much "less" in recent months, however it sure still appears viable.\n\nOnce the OTC deals have been solidified and you have net more coins than you started with, you can use the fiat on exchanges (that you acquired from the initial dump) to bring the price back up, and, if you really wanted to be a dick, repeat the process again and again.....\n\nExample: Keep in mind this changes by the second, so at different points in the day will be more/less beneficial to do......... but if you went to sell 10k coins on finex (at the moment this is being typed), it would bring the price down to around 200 - and will credit your exchange balance a little more than 2 mil USD in value. Let\'s simplify the armchair math by forgetting about the other exchanges and assuming these numbers are for **all** exchanges at the moment. This means, if you can buy back more than 10k coins via OTC methods @ ~200 per coin, you have now made some $$$$ and can now use the 2mil fiat on exchange to pop the price back to where it was, as soon as the order book is thin enough for it to make financial sense to pump.\n\nIs it a gamble? yes...
