Did you  even read some of the responses to his childish finger pointing? Or did you just filter for responses that matched you own bias?\n\nIn case you need a refresher, here\'s of what I told him:\n\n>Well, you broke the first rule when you got into Bitcoin which is, Gavin\'s Standard Public Service Announcement #2: Only invest time or money into Bitcoin that you can afford to lose.\n\n>If, as your username implies, you have become burned out then you obviously didn\'t appreciate that advice that gets bandied regularly here and most other Bitcoin related places. If you truly feel regular people don\'t care then you simply lack perspective. Far more people are involved in Bitcoin than at any time previously and you are just trying to rationalise your loss on external factors, rather than taking responsibility for your own overexuberance (and impatience). If you only discovered/invested in Bitcoin 10 months ago then your perspective is narrow indeed. I\'ve been here since 2010 and I have never vented over the price like you are now, I\'ve ridden through Bitcoin slumps far, far worse than this, I even struggle to rationalise this as a slump, more like a levelling than anything else. You should have been around when the price went vertical DOWNWARDS for several hours.\n\n>For all your rationalisations, Bitcoin is undeniably growing. And it is doing so at an astonishingly fast rate. I personally have always resented those that expect the price to constantly skyrocket, take a couple weeks breather, then skyrocket again, because the Bitcoin economy can only grow so fast and improve gradually. Software for next gen Bitcoin apps don\'t magically debug themselves, legislation and government decisions aren\'t fast tracked just for Bitcoin\'s benefit, consumer confidence doesn\'t miraculously converge on Bitcoin like an avalanch. All these things happen at a crawl, and they SHOULD. A free market grows in fits and starts and Bitcoin is even now in the very early stages where we are still innovating and fixing problems. People that believe otherwise are blinded by greed and need a lesson in patience, and level-headed expectations.\n\n>I personally am ecstatic with Bitcoin\'s progress over the years as I have seen it grow first hand and I can happily say it has far exceeded my expectations and projections.\n\n>See this [image](https://i.imgur.com/N4gjZLg.png) here?  My wild imaginings of Bitcoin\'s growth in Feb 2013 (which was 1 year and 8 months ago) projected that Bitcoin grow to be worth ~40 USD per coin in September 2014. And this was my wildest of the wildest dreams "prediction" that I never bandied about. I simply made the image for my personal curiosity, and left it on my machine until today. Don\'t forget that this was in the days when the 32 USD highs and 2 USD lows was still a fresh memory in everyone\'s mind.\n\n>My, my, how far we\'ve come.\n\n>**You obviously risked too much and or expected some kind of meteoric rise, why else would you be here blaming others for Bitcoin\'s apparent stagnation (at least in your eyes).**\n\n>**Every person here, and elsewhere will tell you that Bitcoin is high risk, and no-one should expect 10X increase in prices as has happened in the past.** It may happen again (I personally hope not cos volatility is crappy), but it\'s just as likely that those volatile days are behind us. I encourage you to "divest" AKA panic-sell and reconsider why you want to be involved in Bitcoin. Or at the very least take Gavin\'s honest and sincere advice a little more seriously and only invest time or money into Bitcoin that you can afford to lose.\n': 2}, ('Bitcoincard', 101): {'[deleted]': -7, 'Mycelium have had working prototypes of credit-card-sized, radio-enabled wallets for well over a year now.

Whether human nature / culture is open to the idea of accepting an abstraction of money, or whether our brains are evolutionarily jailed to forever prefer something tangible, remains to be seen. But if we look at how we use money today, I think we're quite okay with that abstraction. I'm quite happy to have my employer pay me monthly into my account, for me to login to my computer and see a number representation of my money go up, and then to use that online account to automatically pay for my rent and insurance and electricity etc. The tangible notion of getting paid in something I can hold, having a feeling of wealth as I feel a heavy load of coins in my pockets slowly sag down my pants, and being able to walk into a store and put a bag of money on the counter as I buy an item, just isn't a (necessary) part of life anymore. In that sense, I think the youngest generation is fully ready to live in a world with only digital money. \n\nAs for your last question, I'd say absolutely. Things may be legal tender, but there's no fixed price on anything. If I don't want to accept your dollar because I don't believe in it, I can price my apples at $1 trillion dollars. There's no violence or force, usually, exerted on anyone to accept a certain price for an item, nor is anyone forced to sell anything at all, or indeed accept payment in any particular form. You can if you please tell your customers to pay in gold or bitcoin. Legal tender laws do exist and do have influence in some of these cases, but 99% of the time they're completely unnecessary as people are willing to accept money that the market values. And in places where the money isn't valued by the market, legal tender laws are often completely useless. (e.g. when a Zimbabwean bread cost 10 trillion and was self-destructing on inflation, most Zimbabweans simply used a non-legal tender currency like the US dollar instead, despite legal tender laws. Violence by the Zimbabwean government in this case wasn't useful to force anyone to accept the national currency, short of government employees).\n\nBut I don't think I've ever seen a country completely switch to a different currency when their old one wasn't insanely bad. There's no historic precedence that I know of. It usually takes a massive and prolonged currency crisis to get an often long overdue resolution to change currencies. As such I don't think it's likely to see e.g. the US switch to bitcoin. I think it's more likely it'll become a global asset class anyone can and will partially buy into like gold, as a store of value. I think it'll act as a currency in some parts of the world, even temporarily, where the national currency is failing. I think it'll also become a currency of choice for markets in which regular payment channels are restricted. (black and illicit markets.) But beyond that, I think it'll be a payment system that can power other currencies. (e.g. you can hold US dollars in bitcoin, transfer them using bitcoin, by locking in the price. Thus you can have national currencies in digital form outside the traditional banking system. Bitreserve is an early foray into this idea) which extends all the way to machine to machine based payments, for which a digital-native currency will be a very interesting candidate.

Bitcoin gets it right. When you save your money, that means that you\'ve given value but not yet received any kind of real satisfaction. Money isn\'t wealth; it gives you the ability to make a *claim* on a certain amount of real wealth. When you don\'t exercise that claim immediately, the resources that would have gone to satisfying your present consumption remain available to be used by others (for consumption or investment). You have effectively loaned those resources to society. In an economy that uses sound money, deflation represents the market-determined "interest rate" on a very low-risk loan that can be recalled at any time (by spending the money).\n\nEdit: and not only does inflation cause real memories to fade, it does so by replacing them with false memories. Money is supposed to be the credible representation of value given but not yet received, but newly-created money that has been conjured out of thin air can\'t make such a representation truthfully.': 3, 'It\'s an analogy that can help you understand it a bit, but it\'s not technically correct; money is neither memory nor obligation ("favor token"), from an economic point of view.

("Distrust-based" seemed a little harsh.  ) Traditional non-trust-based money (i.e. physical commodities) are difficult and expensive to transact with, particularly across distance.  Commodity I.O.U.\'s (or fiat I.O.U.\'s)  are easier. The downside of using I.O.U.\'s as money is that that they\'re less fungible (the identity of the issuer matters) and they\'re riskier (which would tend to make them less "acceptable").  Governments have been able to offset both of those disadvantages by creating central banks and giving them a monopoly on the power of money creation.  FRN\'s are extremely fungible.  And because of implicit and explicit government guarantees, no one worries about the solvency of the bank where they "deposit" (i.e., lend) their money.  But that intervention (like most government interventions) carried a high price tag.  The balance we\'re talking about was artificially and dramatically shifted in favor of trust-based money.  But trust-based money is inherently risky, and governments didn\'t eliminate that risk. To the contrary, they grew it and made it systemic (a fact that\'s begun to become clear in recent years).  ': 3, "Again feel free to elaborate how it has anything to do with what I said. I'm still left curious.\n\nAnyway if you want to jump into what seems to me a wholly different discussion on smart property, I'd say that smart property is merely the recognition of authorities with power (the courts, police) of a contract that happens to be blockchain based.\n\nI think in the case of a stolen key, that recognition quickly evaporates. I'd assume it quickly becomes clear that there's a difference between a stolen property and a properly traded property, and that record may indeed not be recognized by the courts. We've long had a similar distinction in law between possession (which a thief can get by stealing your car) and ownership (which does not transfer when theft happens, unless e.g. 10 years pass in the case of small stolen items like a library book). Similarly, you'd need to devise a smart property system that can detect this distinction, and then recognize it in the courts accordingly.\n\nIt really depends on the nature of the system. For example, it could be a system with multi-signature keys where you can only transfer the deed with a multi-sig key of each owner on the deed, the key of a notary service and the key of a system which checks for identification of the owners (both the notary and id system could be software-based, or not). Then there'd be a final multi-sig key which would be held by the municipality which runs the blockchain cadastre, which only signs after a week, again this could be software based. And this final signing could be prevented if the owner contacts the municipality to report fraudulent use of his key. Then you could have additional keys that need to be signed by e.g. two independent witnesses, or e.g. a key signed by the bank, so that only a contract in which a deed is transferred from party A to B will be signed by the bank, if party B sends X amount of money to party A as stipulated in the contract, thus requiring a payment for the property. (which, in rare cases, can be circumvented with a more strict procedure). Not to mention the security of these keys, likely they'll be stored by professionals, like banks' safety deposit boxes, in the same way your high-value items could be, today, only accessible in person with identification. etc.\n\nThese are just things from the top of my head. For high-value smart property there's obviously going to be much more stringent procedures than simply 'give a person a single key and let him put it on his laptop' that, once lost, creates a change of ownership.\n\nAnyway I'm just playing devil's advocate here, as per your suggestion to reason through this. Overall I'm wholly unconvinced a smart property system is 'the best thing ever'. It may be useful in some cases, but for high value items and 'once in a lifetime purchases', I don't quite see why we need to try to create a pure software based system to manage that.

Obviously gold has been valued by many societies (although not very much by some), but was it the cultural appreciation of gold that made it valuable as 'money', or was it valuable and therefore used as a cultural object?\n\nSome evidence suggests the latter. For example, aluminium used to be more expensive than gold, because we were able to extract it cheaply in factories using electrolysis. The washington monument is partially coated in it. And when Napoleon held a royal banquet, everyone used gold coated utensils, except the most honorary guests, who used (now cheap and petty) aluminium. BECAUSE it was expensive, for its scarcity, it was deemed to be a precious metal for use in jewelry. Its cultural significance changed at the whims of its value. And so it's reasonable to assume that actual gold, say as a coating of jewels, will be as cheap and useless as a toy ring coated in mere gold-colored paint, the moment that we find a cheap source of gold. (e.g. asteroid excavation), just like it happened with aluminium.\n\nSo there's reason to suggest gold's cultural significance grew out of its properties, its scarcity, that made it valuable, it didn't become valuable because we all liked the color so much. If that were the case, we'd allocate equal appreciation to cheap and ubiquitous gold-colored items.\n\nAs for national fiat having tribal involvement, not inherently, not any more than bitcoin having 'tribal involvement' of the cypherpunk movement, or the libertarian movement, or the technologists movement, or the goldbugs movement, or the anarchist anti-banking movement, or from the  black market movement. Bitcoin's early days all sprung from very clear 'tribal' traditions, perhaps much more so than any government currency in fact.\n\nBut all of this may not be relevant. You ask a question at the end of your post asking if without the historical bridge or the tribe (which I both disagreed with, but assume for a moment bitcoin is unique and doesn't have either), can it be a success? I've already explained in my last post that I don't necessarily see bitcoin replacing any other major decently working currency like the dollar. But that it can and likely will be able to act as a payment system for those currencies. That is, it can do digital dollar payments on an open protocol layer. People can use bitcoin while thinking they use dollars, in the same way people use paypal's centralized ledger while thinking they use dollars. Paypal's ledger may not be a currency anyone recognizes, including paypal themselves, but their ledger certainly is being used by 150m people to transfer fiat currencies completely digitally. Similarly the blockchain may be used, bitcoins may be used, without anyone actually being aware of it. That's where I think the biggest impact of bitcoin will be.

If you have a gold coin and want to trade with me, I am free to accept that - at least on the theory level, things might be different if I am starving and need money to buy food.\n\nThis does not mean that Bitcoin is necessarily debt-free. It is entirely possible to write an IOU which is nominated in Bitcoin, to lend Bitcoins and to do fractional reserve banking with it. As long as Bitcoin is deflating, this is probably not wise, but it is possible; and in some future, it might not deflate any more.\n\nNow the thing is that, similarly as posessing an IOU for a ounce of gold is something different from actually posessing an ounce of gold, **it is different to have an IOU for some amount of Bitcoin (say, on the server of a Japanese currency exchange), and actually posessing some amount of Bitcoin**.

If it was disallowed, people would just sell accounts in secret.\n* Purchased accounts are usually used for signature ad campaigns. Sometimes the buyer simply wants the higher prestige associated with an older account. Purchased accounts are very rarely used for scamming; because account selling is openly allowed, everyone knows to view even Legendary members with suspicion, so the account is usually not worth the cost.\n* While I find the idea of selling accounts to be distasteful, I suppose it\'s a good thing for people to be able to get some money for their previous high-quality forum contributions if they no longer value the account. I\'ve had people ask me whether they could sell their accounts because they desperately need the money, and I really don\'t want to say no to such requests.\n\nAccount recoveries are my lowest priority because they involve a ton of investigation, and you shouldn\'t lose your account in the first place.
