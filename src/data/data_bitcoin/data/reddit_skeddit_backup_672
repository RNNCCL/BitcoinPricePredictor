You'd eliminate a lot of fraud, chargebacks, processing fees, creditcard fees, checking account fees. A lot of those fees are already disappearing for users and merchants, and sometimes that translates into costsavings. For example I can order food online from a takeaway website, from any of about 100 restaurants in my city. It's cheaper with bitcoin (about 7-10% depending on my order size) because I don't pay a processing fee. Gyft regularly offers 3% discounts on any of its products.

I have about \xc2\xa350 in Bitcoin right now. I am not an investor just a casual interested user. I can see a benefit of buying stuff with Bitcoin to avoid credit card fraud and, to be honest, the transaction time is faster.

My own view is we are not at that point of acceptance yet so your question is premature.

As the technology solidifies, it's likely this weariness will decrease and people will feel more and more comfortable getting involved.\n\nIt also need to be realized that seeing as bitcoin is an internet-based technology, most involved are in technologically literate locations. Governement currencies and traditional payment networks in developed areas are typically pretty good, so the need for a lot of what bitcoin brings forward isn't terribly apparent at first glance.

Have you ever tried to purchase something small and been denied because "it needs to cost > 2.00$"? Retailers can pass this value add along to consumers who use Bitcoin in the form of discounts. \n\nAs far as fees and bid/ask spread are concerned, these are driven by the exchange arrangement that you may have. Currently, some Bitcoin sellers, like Circle, offer zero fees. And that 1-3% reward benefit that you get is highly dependent on where you shop, what you buy, and how much you pay for a yearly membership. Not to mention the cost of incurring interest charges. \n\nFor instance, I pay 75$ yearly for a Marriott Rewards Signature Visa, and that reduces the value of the rewards benefits that I receive.

Even if you really do square the difficulty for the SHA256 hashing, you must then also run it at the square of the speed per hash (an equivalent of 100 000 000 hashes per second is your target speed? You have to run close to 10 000 rounds per second on your quantum computer - good luck at even reaching 1 per minute!). And you still won't completely square the difficulty, all the other algorithms mentioned will add to the overhead which makes the probability of success worse than squaring it, meaning you'll need much more than 10 000 quantum rounds/second for a target of 100 000 000 hashes/second.": 2, 'Reversion to the mean...': 4, "Exactly, they'd be cracking the encryption that ties the private key to its public key.": 1, 'I wonder if they would have made more money by waiting a week then firing them all up immediately after the next difficulty change?': 2, 'Thanks!': 1, 'we need that chart in log scale.': 2, 'Look here next time. http://bitcoin.sipa.be/speed-lin-2k.png': 5, 'NSA?': 1, "That makes a lot more sense.

First, even if bitcoin is a massive, unmitigated success, it simply won't completely replace fiat.  I can say that with certainty, because governments will continue doing what they've done for 2000+ years - they'll require that taxes be paid in the money they can print, and they'll pay their workers in the money they can print.  They'll continue to do that for the obvious reasons.  So even if not a single person wants to use government issue fiat, a large percentage of global currency will always remain government issued fiat no matter what.  \n   Second, the extant fiat money supply has little to do with world demand.  We can see this by simply looking at a chart of fiat money in existence over the last 10 years.  It has more than QUADRUPLED.  Seriously.  The US money supply increased from about $800 billion in 2006 to $4.4 trillion today.  The Yen is similar, and the Euro is follow suit, a bit later.  Has the demand for money increased 4x since 2008?  Probably not.  Rather, the amount of money is mostly a result of politics in the broad sense.  Markets equilibrate around the amount of money via the mechanisms of inflation/deflation.  If for some bizarre reason the Federal Reserve reduced the money supply to $10 billion, you'd simply see the price of everything collapse to about 1/25 its current price.": 2, 'For the same total amount of transaction volume (in terms of purchasing power), a higher velocity implies a lower price.

Users could revert to a previous incompatible version of the "fix" is worse.\n\nI think if the developers were going to release a hard fork, they would wait for consensus before releasing it. Supposing conensus is reached, and this new hard forked client is released, and turns out to be a botched idea that awards say thousands of Bitcoins in the initial ramping up of difficulty, then you would have some people going back to the old wallet, some people going forward with the new one, and others just looking on bereft of confidence and certainty.\n\nNote that, and I think this is an incredibly important point, I don\'t even know if difficulty retargeting could be fixed with no dramas occurring. I\'ve seen altcoins developers do it, and they\'ve essentially just reset the difficulty back to 1 and hope there\'s no false starts when they shoot the starter gun.\n\n>Miners do not operate as a single unit, and would cease mining at different times\n\nMy argument is that most miners would cease to mine at about the same time, because electricity costs globally are pretty similar. Keep in mind that in the situation I propose, the value of the machine is no longer a consideration - only the electricity cost, which would exist the rewards from running it. The hash rate or efficiency of the machine would make a negligible difference, since we are talking a few cents an hour here - but which nonetheless adds up to hundreds or thousands of dollars a year.\n\nYou\'ll note however that I do give some room for this factor, because I say it will take place over a number of days. It could be as long as almost a fortnight if you like, because that\'s the normal length of the retarget time. Even if there\'s only 1 normal day before the retarget left, if 99.9% miners left then that would balloon out to 2.78 years.\n\n>Miners & node operators have a greater incentive to adopt any fix than to languish in this catastrophic hash crash\n\nI do mention that \'enthusiasts\' and \'Bitcoin holders\' would continue to mine at a personal loss in the attempt to reach the difficulty retarget, but that this would be in vain.\n\nI base this partly on my own experience with altcoins. I\'ve seen this situation happen before, and a group of people tried concertedly to get it over the line, so to speak. In the end it wasn\'t enough though.\n\nIt\'s even worse for Bitcoin, because most miners are in it solely to make money - they\'re not kids with HD7970s willing to waste a handful of dollarydoos on something they like or believe in. I think a majority of miners would just accept the loss on their hardware, or even more likely, diversify into a SHA-256 alternative (perhaps the one that would replace Bitcoin as the most popular cryptocurrency).\n\n>A preventative fork could likely occur before any of this 99% crash could happen.\n\nThe developers would be unlikely to issue a response until after the miners switch off their machines. The total hash rate has already dropped twice this month (two consecutive difficulty retargets downward), and yet what have the developers done about it? Are they even thinking about this kind of possibility right now? The fact that this post and my comments have been downvoted suggests that this is not a situation most Bitcoiners are even willing to consider as possible.': 1, "> That's true, but leaving your machines on when you're making a net loss just on electricity usage wouldn't help you.\n\nOf course I'm talking about the initial situation where the overall enterprise is making a loss, but switching off the machines would only create a bigger loss (read: mining still yields more than just the cost of only the electricity). Unless you decide to round up your enterprise, it doesn't make sense to quit mining, yet.\n\n\n> I know first-hand from my experience with mining altcoins in the past that when miners drop off, it decreases the profit for the remaining miners.\n> Say you've got 100 miners of equal hash rate working for a 25BTC reward once every 10 minutes. The price of 1BTC is $300. This means each miner gets a reward of $75 per 10 minutes time.\n> Now suppose the price drops to $120. 90 miners drop off. The 25BTC reward comes in 100 minutes time. This means that each of the remaining 10 miners gets a reward of 2.5BTC for 10 minutes work. That translates to 0.25BTC each for 10 minutes work. 0.25BTC x $120 = $30 per 10 minutes time.\n\nYou make a very complicated calculation to show that the revenue is proportional to the BTC price: $75 revenue @ a BTC price of $300 means $30 @ a price of $120 (120/300x75). This has *nothing* to do with miners dropping off.\n\n \n> I wouldn't say a block time of 1 week is 'slightly longer'. Who will use Bitcoin or have confidence in it, when transactions are bottle-necked and take a minimum one week to send even with a fee for priority paid?\n\nYou are twisting it. A block time of a week is the *result* of the domino effect you assume. I say the domino effect will not come into effect. Hence, if a few miners stop, the block time will only increase a little (1, 2, 4 minutes?). It will not increase suddenly from 10 minutes to one week and then induce the domino effect.\n\nI stand by my claim that a few miners quitting won't make many others (i.e. more than half) do the same and hence, doesn't invoke a drastic increase of the block time to hours or days.\n": 1, 'Price has never reached 0.

If anyone can correct me on any details, I'd be grateful. Basically, single use addresses never expose the public keys from which they are derived to the network. As soon as you spend from an address the first time, the public key for that address is revealed to the network. If someone were to attempt to brute force a private key from information publicly available, knowing the public key is one step (one hash specifically) closer to getting there. Of course, each cryptographic step used in Bitcoin is astronomically difficult to reverse, which is why I wrote the effect is small.  \n\nThe other effect is that each time you spend from a single address you are signing a transaction with the static private key associated with that address. This publicizes to the network additional signatures that were made using that private key. If those signatures are somehow collected by an attacker, they may be used as collective data points that could be used to aid a brute force attack. My understanding is that right now, there are no known weaknesses in the cryptography of Bitcoin such that any number of these digital signatures could realistically help break the system, but some future breakthrough in cryptography could change the lay of the land.  \n\nFinally, re-using an address increases its prominence in the block chain, which conceivably could make it a more tempting target to attackers.  \n\nEDIT: grammar": 1, 'I\'m not concerned with the privacy of it, I have a separate wallet with separate coins in case the need for anonymity arises.
