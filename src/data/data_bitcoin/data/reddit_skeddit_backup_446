My detailed style of writings combined with English as a second language might not be good delivery of message for explaining such simple idea.\n\nSo I would be glad if anyone ask me anything about specific details of how my scripts & idea will ideally work, I can explain any parts of this scheme.\n\nAlso I'm looking for better idea of how to improve this current system built for accounting purposes. For the purposes of improvement suggestions, here's the source code of the main brain wallet user interface I've rewritten: http://bitkupon.ru/bitkupon.zip": 1, "Shorter version: This is just an internal experiment inside one company, but ultimate goal is creating more secure scripts & UI for the companies who wouldn't mind adopting our solution for using Bitcoins at least as a coupon system (even if they don't like the idea of accepting BTC directly).\n\nMain idea behind this is using 0.000342 meaning 242 rubles (this is our national currency, minus 100 rubles miners fee pre-calculated which doesn't means anything). Its almost like imagining that 1 cent = 1 dollar, but it works for the virtual units like coupons.": 1, 'So basically, give away value (coupon) via pre funded private key.  Private key = coupon code': 2, 'I\'ll explain (TL;DR): idea is using Bitcoin private keys to create & improve system of scripts which provide entrepreneurs opportunity to handle coupon system in their business.\n\nI know many entrepreneurs in my local area & in other cities I\'ve been. If you would ask most entrepreneurs in our country directly if they are going to consider accepting Bitcoin, 90% of them will have difficulty with understanding why.\n\nBut many of those entrepreneurs have real urgent demand in some kind of CRM / Accounting software which would perform for them something like coupon-system. And Bitcoin can do this.\n\nIn this case we don\'t use Bitcoin as a store of value. We\'re really using it for its transaction / ledger values. I am performing transactions of coupons on the Bitcoin\'s blockchain, here\'s how it works:\n\n1) I\'ve modified the script of brainwallet.org and replaced the words "Passphrase" with "Coupon Code" and explained my boss how to use it. I\'ve removed all the complicated hash-codes (as you can see on imgur I\'ve posted as a subject of this topic)\n\n2) Business owner for whom I\'m making this coupon system are having 150 employees around the city who are directly serving the customers (in therapeutic, healthcare & other services). Yes I could use SQL and Web to create easier database of coupons, but that would presume for this company creating from scratch the coupon balances system, the system of salaries accounting, the system of salaries, the coupon uniquenes check & databases, user accounts system - this is kinda very easy task for experienced programmers, but still a lots of days of development, because its the whole CRM. Why bother, when you can do all of this easier and in much more secure manner with Bitcoin APIs? I found doing the same tasks with Bitcoin even easier than I did this previously for other customers from scratch (we don\'t have really good products ready to use box systems in our country), because Bitcoin has its all.\n\n3) The business owner now pre-fills arbitrary coupon codes which he wants to sell to its customers (He has a discount if someone purchase 10 coupons - so basically customer purchases 10 Bitcoin private keys with fiat). Next time customer comes with the code "238741" for receiving 1 unit of service, non-technical stuff uses mentioned above brainwallet-based form to generate private-key from passphrase (we\'ve changed the algorithm for internal uses, and basically keep it securely hidden on our servers, so don\'t worry about such easy passphrases, they are only seem easy to bruteforce, in fact we use strong master-passwords combined with friendly to customers coupon numbers)\n\n4) When coupon codes for the service are redeemed, our script automatically logs that change & fills our employees with their salaries (fixed fees per service performed)\n\n\nDisadvantages of such system:\n\n1) Customers & stuff never aware that they are using Bitcoin.\n\n2) But they are using it with coupons & coupons usually represent very small values of BTC transferred from 1 BTC-address to another (Basically we use ledger of Bitcoin for accounting purposes for the business)\n\n3) We have to keep in secret our master-passwords, Bitcoin addresses, and this whole thing\'s health is totally destroyed if someone finds out the Bitcoin addresses of our employees :) But we can keep our employees Bitcoin addresses in secret even from employees (by keeping coupon generation process server-side), because this can cause unauthorized transactions from the smart employees who\'ll find out how to use Bitcoin (but that\'s part of my goal that someone will try to find out how to use Bitcoin this way :)) Basically what happens when employee tries to trick system by sending transaction on his work-address from his anonymous address, we are instantly seeing that his BTC address is comprimised whether by him or somebody else & the whole history is pruned & moved to new secret BTC address for accounting purposes.': 1, 'Those private keys are sold as coupons. \n\nCustomers want to buy this private keys, because business owners are ready to give discounts if user purchases 10x amount of business services offered to user. But customers don\'t know about Bitcoins & doesn\'t interested in Bitcoins.\n\nE.g. 1 customer purchased 10 pre funded private keys. Usually customers don\'t know that they can redeem them in Bitcoins by transferring those funds from those private keys to their own wallet (But even if they\'ll do transfer funds out of coupon economy, that\'s fair - customer by doing this just withdraws his funds from the coupons which gives those coupons liquidity guarantee)\n\nBusiness owner wins, because he just sold 10x amount of services (with discount) instead of providing just 1 service at a time.\n\nCustomer is happy because he just acquired needed service in large quantity with a discount.\n\nBitcoin is growing because of handling this types of transactions, but customers doesn\'t even know what Bitcoins is - customer never asks silly questions like "how do I spend my Bitcoins" - next time customer comes with his 1 of 10 private keys to the company, the company provides needed service to the customers & transfers back from the pre funded private key coupon.': 1, "Simplest explanation of this idea I've ever heard": 1}, ('Cyber attacks a growing threat for US financial system', 15): {'MtGox is not Bitcoin. \n\nCash is not safe, easily counterfeited, easily stolen, hard to transfer large amounts.': 3, 'Cash is safe.

There would need to be some cap on how much of the value of a tx is used in the calculation of the BDD, so that X BTC spent through many small txs makes a much larger contribution to BDD than if it were spent by one large one.\n\nEDIT: they don't need to store multiple full UTXO_sets, as suggested in the Pastebin description.

Because what you write here is quite scary.': 1, 'Skip to the section titled "The 51% trade." His whole argument hinges on shorting BTC and acquiring mining power then performing a 51% attack. \n\nHis fallacy is static thinking; he doesn\'t appreciate that the quantities he is dealing with change dynamically as the situations he is positing come to be feasible. He\'s like a kid looking at a baby lion and a baby giraffe, and thinking, "This tiger is winning their scuffles now, but wait \'til the giraffe grows up. He\'ll stomp that poor little cub into the ground with his big adult hooves!" \n\nHe makes this error in various places:\n\n- He says that the "bucket shop" exchanges of today don\'t allow for the kind of "high-powered" shorting that Wall Street can bring, failing to realize that Wall Street getting in coincides with Bitcoin already being much bigger. The lion does not stay a cub as the giraffe grows. \n\n- He incongruously suggests a scenario where billions of dollars in securities are secured by the blockchain while seeming to imagine that the hashrate hasn\'t hasn\'t grown astronomically with the BTC value rise that would bring. Conversely, securities of that size will not be put on the blockchain until the BTC market cap is big enough to provide the proper incentives. The lion cub has grown into a ferocious beast, but in the author\'s mind only the giraffe has grown. Conversely, the giraffe will not have grown into a big cub-stomping adult until the lion has grown as well. \n\nBesides this repeated error of static thinking, his incentive analysis fails to take into account all factors at once. The attacker can indeed try to "double-spend" a security worth billions, but as he says, the legal system will not agree after the fact, even if the blockchain does. What many people, including apparently the author, fail to recognize is that what Nasdaq and the Honduras are doing doesn\'t defend against corruption or overturning of title *through the official state apparatus*. It doesn\'t matter if the blockchain says you have a legit land title or a bearer share, the government can still invalidate it. The point of putting it on the blockchain is that it makes shenanigans *through non-official means* more difficult. The state can always unilaterally come in and tell Google to invalidate whatever shares you were issued, but it will have to do it through an at least ostensibly legal channel. This makes the attack not only pointless but bankrupting for the attacker, and note that this argument stacks with the above static thinking point.\n\nUntil companies are also anonymous there won\'t be such a thing as truly uncensorable bearer share transactions. And even at such time when there are, the above arguments apply regarding shorting.\n\nFinally, the apparent ease with which the author thinks a 51% attack could be performed is vastly amplified by his drinking the selfish miner attack Kool-Aid (I believe this is Emin\'s misunderstanding, but this post is long enough already so I won\'t press the point here), neglecting other ways of guarding against a 51% attack (Gavin\'s proposal), and ignoring the antifragile factor in that any small "threaten the mining pool operator" attack instantly changes miner and client default behavior to remove hashing power from any pool that goes offline in a way that could be trying to do a 51% attack, not to mention physical security upgrades at mining pools as price rises (lion won\'t stay a cub), assuming we\'re still even using mining pools by that time (21 Inc., commoditization of ASICS; infrastructurally as well, the lion won\'t stay a cub).\n\nSince the final piece of his argument is that securities cannot be subject to such uncertainties, which is fundamentally an argument about numbers and magnitudes (even the current system with auditors and accountants by no means guarantees 100% certainty), his sloppy thinking about the quantities involved cannot be excused. The cub does not remain a cub, and insofar as the cub does remain a cub so does the giraffe (the incentive to attack). ': 10, 'I see your point, thank you for your time.

You've basically just killed the entire colored coin market by doing this.": 4, 'double negation detected ;-)': -1, "So you mean that if, say, the total value of all colored coins is $5 trillion and the BTC market cap is only $1 trillion, a large miner might try to double-spend some colored coins (e.g., sell stock shares twice), knowing that double spend will only hurt the BTC price and not the price the attacker gets for the shares (because share value >> block reward)? \n\nI've seen this concern before, but I think what it neglects is that a world where stock shares are colored bitcoins is a world where you are selling those shares *for* bitcoins. See what I mean? ": 20, "So in the example of ChainDB by Bitpay or Factom's land registry.\n\nI see how Bitcoin's (the network) value is getting bigger, but how does that exactly translate to bitcoin (the currency)?

Up you go!': 5, 'Agreed ': 6, "Maybe I'm missing something. Doesn't the concept of colored coins require some kind of centralized ledger that delineates exactly what asset each colored coin represents? Couldn't it then be a very simple task to implement some kind of daily clearing activity which secondarily tracks transactions of colored coins on the block chain and immediately exposes fraud? And at that point, would it not be fairly simple to correct the problem outside the colored coin system and issue a new colored coin? \n\nFew assets with title evidence are owned anonymously, except for Bitcoin itself, and even then it's theoretically possible to track ownership through the blockchain. \n\nThe only case where I see an attack being a problem is with double spending to steal bitcoin itself - although once the problem is exposed, the entire system will  collapse and value will drop to zero, thus rendering such an attack useless. Of course a clever attacker can find a way to immediately convert the stolen coins for value, but once the attack happens, it's a serious race against the clock. One would think that it would be even more useless to try to do this to steal land, because everyone will immediately know who you are and what you stole. ": 1, 'Not at all. Miners fees forever! ': 1, "Right, which is why there needs to be safeguards in place to prevent major losses in this case. I would argue that if such an event were to happen, the system would destabilize and collapse, and we'd revert back to excel spreadsheets and central authorities. The only way the 51% attack really is dangerous is if someone could conduct one without anyone ever finding out. ": 1, '> If we have other values on the blockchain this could add a new dimension of motivation to attack\n\nBecause attackers can steal eg nasdaq shares?  I\'m pretty sure they\'ll design it so this can\'t happen, if poss to do so.  Also note that certainly it will provide a "new dimension of motivation to defend".  Ppl like NASDAQ will have an interest in ensuring network is robust, decentralised etc.': 4, "Imagine for instance you have a colored coin representing the deed (your ownership) to a $20,000,000 building. You own that coin, you own the building. Say someone just sold you that colored coin for $20m, but then uses his massive computing power to undo that transaction. Effectively stealing the property back.\n\nIn game theory modeling with regards to bitcoin itself this won't happen, because someone with that much computing power would presumably just use it to earn bitcoins instead. But with this colored coins example, there is no such incentive. \n\nI think OP raises a very good concern. It may mean that colored coins won't be able to be used solely on their own for very valuable assets.": 1, 'I might be missing your point but I try to look at the big picture and I think everything and anything that makes use of the ecosystem is good for the ecosystem.\n\nNASDAQ *and* Silk Road *and* LiveJasmin are good for Bitcoin.

Separately from the miner\'s fee there is a "minimum spend" lower-limit for transactions which is around 5400 satoshis. These services must spend/hold at least some satoshi for each OP_RETURN they want mined. That\'s demand, it might be small, but it\'s demand.': 1, "This is a great counter argument but I don't think the emergence of colored coin stocks is mutually exclusive with bitcoin being the only currency.  The shares could easily be sold for any currency, mitigating the cost of a BTC price drop on the attacker's incentive.\n\nIf the colored coin market cap is $5T and BTC is only $1T then the economic incentives of miners have definitely changed.  In reality this 5:1 ratio could become even larger - and we already have a scenario where transaction fees are likely not going to support the network in its current form.  I think this incentive structure is more fragile than we give it credit for.\n\nAs these economic incentives shift, a period where attacks become more economically feasible is definitely a possibility.": 5, 'The scenario posed by FreeToEvolve was that very valuable colored coin assets would provide an incentive for a 51% attack that raw Bitcoin values would not. Unlike the anonymity of a double spent Bitcoin a double spent stationary physical asset like a house or a block of stock certificates could be traced back to the attacking miners adding liability costs to their conspiracy that would not be there with Bitcoin.

So, even if it has smaller features, perhaps it is totally uncompetitive.  That could explain why they are trying to push it for embedded use rather than industrial mining, why they emphasize "a satoshi mined on the spot is worth more than one bought at the market" -- and why they gave no performance figures.\n\n': 0, '> [ 21.co: ] *Crucial to this is the idea that bitcoin generated by embedded mining is more convenient\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8aand hence more valuable\xe2\x80\x8a\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x8athan bitcoin bought at market price and manually moved over to the site of utility.*\n\nBut there is this thing called "internet" that allows a single stationary "mining" device to generate revenue (bitcoins or dollars, it doesn\'t matter) that can be spent by its owner or any designated set of devices, no matter where they are, even if there is no direct internet connection between them.  There is no advantage in *physically* attaching the revenue-generating device A to a device B that is meant to perform a totally unrelated function.

Those who get a device with the "free" embedded 21.co chip will not have the option to throw it away.\n\n> EVIL: 21 sees the opportunity to control a very large mining pool, and they\'re offering a cut of those profits to all manufacturers and distribution channels, and getting unsuspecting consumers to pay for it with "free" electricity. \n\nMore simply: If their plan means that 21.co loses money, it is stupid.

I want to use bitcoin with the people I know, I would like them to try bitcoin so then they buy some more for themselves, so we can use them instead of cash and transition to a more fluid, sharing based economy (e.g. fan/spread - microtransactions).\n\nI found that when I tell people about bitcoin, and want to give some millibits so they actually can try the experience of using a wallet, the first step is always to ask them to install a wallet app, so I can send some millibits to them.\nWhat I found is that they usually don\'t want to do it straight away (especially if I just met them), or there are connection issues etc etc.. also, it feels that the first experience they have with it is too digital, it all seems a bit "virtual" to them, they don\'t understand well what a private key is and other core bitcoin concepts.\n\nI have a 3D printer (cheap RepRap one), so I decided 3D print some bitcoin "coins" and I stuck an NFC tag on each of the coins.\nI first ask which phone they have (iphone/android); if they have and android phone with NFC I hand over the tag to them and tell them to try to scan it. They don\'t have to do it right now but as the tag is pretty (and strong) they\'ll not throw it away, break it they (or somebody else eventually) will do it (paper wallets are a bit fragile - I used to print those with http://paperbank.it but NFC tags are better).\n\nIn the NFC tag I usually used to put an url in the tag pointing to this guide I made on how to spend them: https://github.com/makevoid/3d_printed_nfc_bitcoins#3d-printed-nfc-bitcoins\n\nBut the process was very long (especially for me, the load process was way too complex) - This is the main video of how I used to load/spend the tags using Mycelium: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6auYqP9tKw uuh!\n\nThe tags I\'m using cost half a dollar each ( http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Hot-Sale-Universal-5PCS-NFC-Tag-Stickers-Adhesive-Label-Memory-For-iPhone-6-plus-For-Sale/32250524513.html ) and to 3D print the enclosure the cost for the plastic is about 20 cents.\nI load the tags with 5 or 10 millibits and always carry few of them with me so I can hand them over.\n\nI think adoption is critical, also that as NFC 3D printed bitcoin tags can be used as "notes", in the real world, for a newcomer, the impact that this Bitcoin is a real thing and not another "cool" hipster thing / app to download and soon forget.\nBitcoin is revolution.

If they or any other online bitcoin wallet disappeared, you would have ABSOLUTELY no recourse, even if its was 100,000$ worth of money.

These verification steps help ensure that no one can mess with your money or transactions\n\nSince there is so much verification to do, sending very small amounts on the blockchain is generally discouraged, instead the idea is that you can use another network to keeps track of very small amounts and if the small amounts add up to anything serious you can send them to your own wallet through the Bitcoin network\n\nFor example if someone sends you Bitcoin like /u/changetip 250 bits, those are not real Bitcoin they are just credit on another network that you can put towards real Bitcoin if you want them and you have enough to not be too trivial for the network to deal with": 10, 'Enjoy a donuthole on me /u/changetip': 1, 'Thanks.

Some of the explanations in this thread are a little bit off and I can tell that you are at the point in your bitcoin journey where you are curious, but you need to be careful not to make a mistake.\n\nbasically bitcoins exist as a value assigned to a public key.  A bitcoin address is a shortened version or hash of this public key.  When someone sends you bitcoin, they transfer ownership over bitcoins that were formally assigned to their public key by signing a transaction with the private key that corresponds to the public key.  The transaction just says, take 2 bitcoins that were assigned to my public key and assign them to another public key.  This is picked up by miners and included in the next block.  The blockchain is a record of all of these transactions, which taken to the present shows ownership of bitcoin.  You only really own bitcoin if its in an address that only you own the private keys to.  So if its on a website and not on a wallet you control, its really just a website credit.  Feel free to respond to me with further questions, I've been around these scene for years now and I realize the explanation I gave might have been muddy but its very important you understand these things.
