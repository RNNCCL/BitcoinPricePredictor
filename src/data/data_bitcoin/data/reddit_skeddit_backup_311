It has to compete with other money services if people are ever going to want to use it.": 5, 'BIP101': 3, "At 500 bytes per transaction 32 MB would allow for 106 transactions per second. I wouldn't call it exactly a *tiny* fraction. Also by the time blocks larger than 32 MB are needed Lightning Network and other scalability solutions will most likely be ready.

Thank you.': 2, '> But it\'s my understanding that BIP101 has more code in it than just an increase in block size to 8mb. [ie: IP address blocking, if certain conditions are met]\n\nBIP 101 itself increases the maximum block size to 8MB, and then increases the max block size every block, with an average schedule of doubling it every 2 years for 20 years, at which point the maximum blocksize will be 8 GB. This is an average growth of 41% per year. Since [Nielsen\'s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jakob_Nielsen_%28usability_consultant%29#Contributions) posits that bandwidth increases by 50% per year, this growth rate should be less than technology\'s growth rate, and therefore it should still get cheaper to run a full node as time increases.\n\nThe only-bigblocks code implements basically only BIP 101 (I think there is also some rebranding code changes as well).\n\nAs for why the other changes are included, I think [this message](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bitcoin-xt/PBjK0BuB7s4/8LREpcaNBQAJ) from Mike explains his reasoning pretty well.\n\nI personally would rather see [redacted] just implement BIP 101 for now, but I also don\'t think that the other changes are nearly as bad as some of the FUD I\'ve seen about them. There is nothing trying to be "snuck" in. They\'re very open about the additional changes, and the rationale behind those changes.': 6, "The Lightning Network proposal includes a concept of Hubs. You send an initial payment to the hub (e.g. for 10 BTC), which has an automatic release time (e.g. 1 month). This gives the hub the power over your coins for the duration of the release time. If the hub decides that you're a terrorist, they have the ability to lock up your funds until the release time is up.\n\nThe hub must also be accepted by the merchant you want to use, or else it is useless to you as a customer. This will likely lead to a centralization of hubs, and governments exerting their control over the hubs. If on-chain fees are high enough that most payments are forced to go through the lightning network, then we are in a situation that isn't much different than today - with companies like Visa and Mastercard deciding where it's appropriate for you to spend your money.": 4, 'Well, BIP100 is kind of "upward soft fork".

Thinning the mining herd is a good thing.": -5, "First of all I expect Lightning to be used for day to day low value transactions which would be unprofitable to try to confiscate (remember that if your counterparty tries to defraud you, you are able to take all his money locked in the channel). For higher value transactions I expect on-chain to be fine.\n\nAlso if blocks grow too big I would be surprised if node operators *didn't* start to charge for serving SPV clients.

Exit scams aren't possible on LN. A hub can at worst delay your payments.\n\nIt's also possible it would work better to bridge *voting pools* over LN, because this would completely sever the link between payor and payee; it would just be your voting pool paying another voting pool, all of which have destructible receipts.\n\nAs always, larger on-chain payments can afford to pay the price of settling on-chain. If cash is banned, the $20 hit to make a payment on-chain would be undeniably worth that price for payments that would be otherwise impossible.\n\nAnd if you're really concerned about making all taboo payments possible, it's by far more important to protect against outside interference into Bitcoin's core consensus library.

Checkmultisig is verification time linear in the number of public keys, storage linear in threshold; not great.\n\nUsable:  Does the protocol require anything that harms usability, e.g. many round trip? The one pass checkmultisig is basically ideal in this respect.\n\nPrivate: How much does it leak the multisig policy to _non-participants_ (without gratuitous efficiency loss)? This is both a security (e.g. knowing how many keys you need to steal) and an anonymity consideration.   Checkmultsig fails this basically completely.\n\nNative threshold schnorr (which also works in Elements Alpha) and ECDSA fail accountability but have perfect privacy. So far workable non-trusted-setup ECDSA has bad usability, native threshold Schnorr is two-rounds regardless of the threshold size so it\'s somewhat less usable than checkmultisig, but not terrible.  Efficiency wise the plain threshold schemes have perfect (O(1)) efficiency.  \n\nThe treesig approach has perfect accountability and privacy is configurable and more privacy is cheap. The efficiency is pretty good, always half the size of a checkmultisig and in some cases enormously smaller. Usability is the same as threshold schnorr.

The only practical way to encode such a diversity of reference cases is essentially "the output of this X86 program run on any Intel/AMD compatible hardware." The consensus code *is* the standard. If there was an ISO Bitcoin standard, it would be an assembly dump of libconsensus with references to the Intel architecture manuals.\n\nIt is not, practically speaking, possible to reimplement the consensus code in any other language, because of subtle differences in the behavior of different languages / runtimes. For a simple example, take BIP 42: the original bitcoin client diverged from just about every other implementation in that subsidy reverted to 50 btc after about 250 years. That happened to be a trivial to fix error since it wasn\'t triggerable until the 23rd century, but it does illustrate a point: Python, Ruby, and Haskell re-implementations of bitcoin copied that subsidy line _exactly as it was written in Bitcoin Core_, but because of differences in how integer shifting out of range is handled in C++ on Intel/AMD vs defined behaviour in these other languages, that same code compiled in a different language produced a different result.\n\nThe consensus code *is* the specification.': 9, 'Is that an improvement assuming somebody already avoids address/key reuse?': 3, 'more efficient use of multisignature and better privacy': 19}, ('Where can I buy a teamspeak server cheaply using bitcoin?', 1): {'If you need under 32 slots you can just set up your own without a license': 1, "I've never used them before, but from a quick Google, [teamspeak.us](https://www.teamspeak.us/) seems to accept bitcoin.": 1, "If you're still looking for a host send me a message ill hook you up :)": 1}, ("MIT Course 'to Inspire Next Generation of Bitcoin CEOs'", 9): {'Shameless plug\n\nCome visit us over at gobithib.com!

Thinking about malicious "worst-case scenarios" is generally very good way to assess proposals. Please feel free to add scenarios and/or consequences I missed:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n1) Big miners want block increase - they want to drive out small miners, increase cost for running full nodes for smaller players, drive out competition  \n1a) They can collect as many legitimate transactions as they can and maximally fill the blocks.  \n1b) They can collect SPAM transactions or encourage such transactions  \n1c) They can construct (oversized and overnumbered) transactions by themselves and self-mine them.  \n\n&nbsp;\n\ncase 1a) is correct function of miners and beneficial to Bitcoin as transactions are included as soon as possible.  \ncase 1b) is hindered by second proposal as the SPAM needs to include substantial fees. (This is also reason too much SPAM is uneconomical in current 1MB state. Is there actually better anti-SPAM solution besides combination with dust-prevention at full-node levels?) With continuing push for block size increase, absolute value of SPAM fee in BTC must constantly increase (albeit minimally) to beat previous average, but the number of such transactions (and thus total feecost in BTC) increases geometrically. Full nodes have incentive not to relay such transactions.  \ncase 1c) Similarly to 1b), miners too must include substantial fees. 1cA: If they announce such monstertxs they will risk that they, including fees, will be stolen from them by other miners (unless having >51% hashpower which is another problem). They can only decrease the cost in ratio of their hashpower, but not eliminate it. 1cB: If they do not announce such transactions and self-mine them. Then the cost in fees is effectively zero. ... But such pools will still have to distribute fees to individual miners, otherwise individual miners will have incentive to choose other pool and{or they will definitely put pressure on pool operators after seeing such large undistributed fees. So the cost stays (and doubles as long as push for increase stays).  \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nI think only case 1cB needs more elaboration. What if the individual miners are the ones pushing for bigger blocks (not justified by "legitimate" transactions like in 1a)) ? Then they are getting fees back, hmm. But if they do not control more than 51% they can not push block size too much. Or can they?  \nActually, this case needs carefully strict parameters or inclusion of some first proposals to second proposal (like if more than 60% of blocks are above 90% of MaxBlockSize).  \nExample: Imagine in the future (reasonable) maxblocksize is 4MB and real, justified mean utilization by legitimate transactions is around 1MB. Then big miners collude and start to generate big blocks with self-mined (fee-returning) transactions. They can not (yet) generate bigger blocks than 4MB, of course, such blocks would be invalid. So very bad case scenario is 50% of miners colluding and generating full 4MB blocks. Then meansize will be suddenly 2.49MB in next period (5008/2008).  \nTotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty=2008  \nTotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty=8+1000+4000=5008  \nIncrease will NOT trigger as (7016/4016)MB<(50% * 4MB)  \n...But the miners will continue. Meansize will be 2.49MB even in next following period  \nTotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty=1004+4016=5020  \nTotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty=4+16+1000+4000=5020  \nIncrease WILL\xc2\xa7 trigger as (10040/4016)MB>(50% * 4MB)  \n\xc2\xa7 - "actually in this exact case it will not, because TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty > TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty is not met, but it is easy for miners to hold back in the first period to increase it in the second one."  \nBlock size will be increased by factor (TotalBlockSizeInLastDifficulty/TotalBlockSizeInLastButOneDifficulty) which is close to one.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOK. *Please someone try to design realistic scenario, where big miners can collude to push ever incresing maxblocksize and such push being economically feasible.* I will try one more. (However, in any case where miners are pushing too big blocks, nodes can defend by "soft fork" limit to maxblocksize.)  \nWhat if first push by colluding 50% of miners is by 2MB blocks and second one is by 4MB blocks?  \nThen: 1st period: TBSILBOD=2008, TBSILD=3008, NOT trigger; 2nd period: TBSILBOD=3012, TBSILD=4+8+1000+4000=5012, NOT trigger (1.998<2). ... OK, thats too lose. If first push is slightly higher then WILL trigger, but increase factor will be 5012/(3012+epsilon) = 1.65x increase. If in the next 3rd period push is maximal by (new MaxBlockSize) 6.6MB blocks then TBSILD~=7630 and increase will NOT trigger (3.148<50%*6,6). Perhaps with some clever collusion increase can be triggered in the next period but I believe that not so big as 1.65x again. But keep in mind that in addition to that in all situations where increase will not trigger, colluding miners must maintain high fees ~~and~~ or some "nondeflated" mean block size otherwise decrease will trigger instead.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n----------------------OK, this is getting too long--------------------  \nPerhaps I will split my post and elaborate remaining cases separately tomorrow or later:  \n2) Miners want block decrease  \n3) Miners want block size freeze. (blocking any changes)  \n4) Nodes want block size increase.  \n5) Nodes want block size decrease.  \n6) Nodes want block size freeze. (blocking any changes)  \n\n&nbsp;\n\nJust final remark: Cases 3, 6 seem like no issue, because if they are economical motivated then it is usually more advantageous to straight push for increase or decrease. (Someone who benefits from NOT increasing maxblocksize will usually benefit more by even decreasing it. Someone who benefits from NOT decreasing maxblocksize will usually benefit more by even increasing it.)\nHowever this is not true, because reasons for 3, 6 can be ideological (Bitcoin is what it is and it should stay this way. Lets its [differently and in contradicting ways] perceived flaws be solved by alternate competing solutions/altcoins/sidechains/projects/startups built on the top and around stone-dependable Bitcoin protocol.) There is specific value in stability, predictability and independence on external forces.

It's the pool that makes the block, and pools are composed of large and small miners, so the pool can't really stratagize one way or the other. Thanks for helping me to see this.

There is no provision in BIP 100 to reduce the max cap.\n\nii. BIP 100 proposes manual voting of miners through code.

Imagine if difficulty were chosen by manual voting.': 3, 'I was thinking about case 1cB more. And I found another counterargument. It is actually easily refuted, but it should be examined: Big Miners will not fill their blocks with self-mined not-announced fee-rich monstertxs, because they would exhaust space for ordinary transactions.  \nIn the time where coinbase reward will be small and fees will be the main source of miner\'s ~~income~~ reward for securing the network, they would have incentive to include legitimate fee-paying txs instead of self-mined fee-neutral ones.  \nUnfortunately, this is not so relevant. We are speaking of case 1c) where big miners want to push maxblocksize well above size sufficient for legitimate transactions. So they can include every legitimate transaction anyway and only after that fill the rest of the block with self-mined monstertxs. However, they have to (have incentive to) constantly update their block with newly incoming legitimate transactions and evict self-mined ones. Whereas fair miners just add the newly incoming. I do not know if it gives colluding miners some significant disadvantage.  \nWe shall return to this case further. For now it seems to me that some hardcoded limit to maxblocksize (which can not be beaten by 50% or 70% of colluding miners) is needed. Perhaps the one from BIP100, where 90% of miners must "vote" and agree for 3 months to increase it.  \n&nbsp;  \nSo lets look at other scenarios.  \n2) Miners want block size decrease - they hope that constricted space will force Bitcoin users to increase fees significantly and they want exercise (political) power in excluding certain transactions or offering "not excluding them" for  ~~ransom~~ payment.  \n2a) They can mine empty (or almost empty) blocks  \n2b) They can ignore bigger blocks and enforce personal soft limit  \n&nbsp;  \ncase 2a) is economically disadvantageous as soon as coinbase reward drops and fees are the main income. Individual miners have incentive to switch pool to get some bigger reward (from non-empty blocks) in the present time instead of some unsure reward (caused by constricted blocks) in the future. Moreover, if the miners somehow succeed in making the block space constricted *and* fees increased then the mechanism in the proposal will very soon increase maxblocksize again.  \n2aA: If after decrease high fees are blocked by miners (in an attempt to hinder maxblocksize increase back) then they did not achieve profit from constricted block space.  \n2aB: If after decrease block space is not made constricted/full by miners (in an attempt to hinder maxblocksize increase back), but high fees are required by miners to include txs then we have something which is possible even in current situation (with 1MB fixed maxblocksize). Competition makes such collusion (cartel setting minimal fee for inclusion) unstable as individual miners/pools have incentive to be the first one to cheat and grab big chunk of just-a-little-lower-fee transactions.  \ncase 2b) is effectively a attempt to soft-fork. Miners set their own limit for block size and ignore bigger blocks. More than 50% must collude to enforce this soft-fork as the longest chain. This situation is also unstable (regulated by market forces) due to increase in fees and incentive for miners to include such juicy txs. Again, this is nothing new in comparison with current situation where very small blocks can be theoretically enforced by soft-fork, but they are not (750kB is not too small and it works, 75kB would probably fail quickly).  \nThe situation 2b) where e.g. 80% of miners accept only small blocks is very different from situation 2a) where small blocks are "compulsory" by decreasing maxblocksize. Former situation is unstable because anyone from the remaining 20% hashpower can mine bigblock and full nodes (merchants, exchanges, individuals) will happily accept it and propagate it and can even tempt the 80% by building fee-rich transactions on this bigblock.  \n&nbsp;  \n3) Miners want maxblocksize freeze - neither increase nor decrease. They value stability and predictability.  \n3a) and situation (amount of legitimate transactions) calls for neither increase nor decrease  \n3b) and situation (amount of legitimate transactions, congestion, fees, waiting times) calls for increase  \n3c) and situation (amount of legitimate transactions, full node problems, small miners lags) calls for decrease  \n&nbsp;  \n----------------TO BE CONTINUED-------- (if upvoted :-])': 3, "There's a big discrepancy between hashing power and bandwidth.

Nodes currently run on a volunteer basis, with just around a dozen being run by services that might profit from them, all of them in a few selected jurisdictions. This for many of us is not acceptable already and should be resolved rather than allowed to deteriorate further.\n\nOrphaned blocks mean slower transactions, double spends in confirmed blocks, and accidental or malicious charge-backs among other things. It also means that miners will end up just ignoring some protocol soft rules like those of block size, which is something they can do single-handedly, and it will cause a huge amount of uncertainty in the future of the system.\n\nIt's very naive to expect it to just work when there is no incentive to protect some characteristics that are indispensable to keep BTC working in a pseudonymous, decentralised, neutral fashion.\n\nThe protocol and its hard and soft rules need adjustments so that the resources markets work better than they are doing currently.": 1, 'According to you, large miners could just collude under one pool to force difficulty up at which small miners wont get anything and will shut down eventually.

Eventually the block size will become too big for small miners with lower bandwidth to compete. ': 8, 'Again... I had some new ideas about previous case. So the only threat in the case 2) which I see, is *majority* of miners colluding from *political* reasons in an effort to decrease maxblocksize via 2aA scenario. It would be cost them money, but they can have non-economic incentive. (Like big government agency not caring for money trying to bring Bitcoin into congestion.) This again is similar to current scenarios of government sponsored 51% attack by mining empty blocks only. It is costly, it can not reverse transactions or steal people\'s BTC, it CAN hinder transactions for some time, it is easily corrected as soon as attack ends. In the case of this BIP-Draft ... well the network would take some more time to recover (in addition to clear backlog, to recover reasonable maxblocksize). So the attack becomes more damaging. However, such attack does not become cheaper or easier with decreasing maxblocksize, there is no positive-feedback. Legitimate miners would have to defend by bringing more hashpower and in really very bad case nodes could defend by consensual imposing minimal value of maxblocksize. This is probably the same defense that would be used today (or some months or years ago). \nNevertheless I think that some *minimal* value of maxblocksize (like 64kB) should be taken into discussion and **maybe** hardcoded just in case. At least until block subsidy drops considerably and defending economic incentives will rise. Unless someone presents realistic case why smaller blocks would be legitimately needed, 64 kB seems reasonable even for the most conservative voices.  \n**A little diversion:** Concerning BIP100 (which is not topic of this thread, but the audience should have large intersection, and it is gaining massive recognition)... I think above-mentioned scenario is a much bigger problem in BIP100, where (mere) 21% of colluding miners can push maxblocksize down. I feel that unless Jeff Garzik clarifies item 9. on the 6th page of his BIP100 proposal, upgrades this mechanism or refutes this risk, BIP100 should include hardcoded minimal value of maxblocksize.  \n&nbsp;  \nNow the next case...  \n3) Miners want maxblocksize freeze - neither increase nor decrease. They value stability and predictability.  \n&nbsp;  \n3a) and situation (amount of legitimate transactions) calls for neither increase nor decrease  \n3b) and situation (amount of legitimate transactions, congestion, fees, waiting times) calls for increase  \n3c) and situation (amount of legitimate transactions, full node problems, small miners lags) calls for decrease  \n&nbsp;  \ncase 3a) is not a problem, but a correct equilibrium. Yet, the *interpretation* of where exactly this equilibrium lies and whether it has been achieved is of course another thing. Some people consider even todays situation as "too congested" and point out that it is easy to create backlog by stress test. Some people consider even todays situation as "too much space" and point out that almost every transaction is included, users are not motivated to increase fees and reward miners appropriately, and SPAM is too easy and too cheap to produce. I do not think this can be resolved (objectively).  \nHowever. Can some\xc2\xa7 group of miners keep (whichever) maxblocksize from changing? They can observe the trends and try to balance them. If mean block size increase they can mine more sparse blocks and choose juicy-fee transactions only. But they will be in economic disadvantage, because competing miners will include both these juicy-fee transactions *and* large number of other ones. If mean block size decrease they can subsidize SPAM (not for long) or self-mine big txs (with all the problems described in 1cB). Group of miners can also block maxblocksize increase by NOT including fees in their transactions (or choosing free transactions/SPAMsactions/self-generate and mine zero-fee txs). This again is economically unstable and prone to individual miners desertion toward pools focused on higher fee txs. Similarly blocking decrease by generating self-mined fee-rich transactions is somewhat easier. But as in case 1cB, it must be individual large miners who collude and they must have significant hashpower.  \nIt would actually be very interesting to observe various miners interplay and interaction in an effort to balance each other\'s push.  \n\xc2\xa7 - very large majority of miners can of course enforce soft-fork as always, nothing new here.  \ncase 3b) is economically unstable from the reasons stated in 3a). Moreover there are high fees and high incentive to grab those transactions.  \ncase 3c), well it looks that blocking maxblocksize decrease is easier than blocking maxblocksize increase. The way is creating big txs. Oops, that is bad, because those do not have to be fee-rich and self-mined. While it is necessary to have *both* big blocks and high fees to push maxblocksize increase, it suffices to have only one of these to hinder decrease. High-fee transactions must be self-mined by colluding individual miners (otherwise they would be bleeding money), but large txs with small fees can be announced freely.  \nFull nodes can still defend by soft-fork rejecting large blocks en masse. But whether it would be enough, I do not know.  \n&nbsp;  \nMaybe there is a problem. Blocking decrease in maxblocksize is easier than blocking increase and also easier than pushing increase. So as soon as miners push maxblocksize increase (which is not so easy), maintaining it is in fact easier. It might still be too difficult, though.  \nI have seen a proposal somewhere (do not remember which BIP it was) that maxblocksize should gradually decrease because of this asymmetry. (Such as if there is no change in maxblocksize for several periods [like 2-3 months] then maxblocksize will start to automatically decrease by 5% every period. This decrease will be ~~stopped~~ reversed as soon as legitimate transactions would require it. But it would be difficult for malicious colluding miners to reverse this on their own. While mere blocking is easier.)  \n&nbsp;  \nOnly cases 4,5,6 concerning nodes remain.  \n----Phew, I think that before I finish this, some BIP would be probably already in place :-)----': 1, 'You can gamed the dynamic block size if you can *publish* most of the block...\n\nYou will have to create plenty of spam Tx and only if you fill you block with plenty of spam you can push the network to create bigger block..

If more people are using bitcoin as a currency they'll be more demand for the limited resource so assuming supply remains constant the exchange price will rise until an equilibrium of supply/demand is reached.  'Using blockchain' however may also mean using the chain to store meta data such as how NASDAQ and others are looking into bitcoin's blockchain.  These approaches don't really add any value to bitcoin's coin price since it's the transaction that stores the data not the value of coins being transferred.  I.e. they can make a btc transaction of ~$0.01 and tag that to represent 1,000,000 Apple shares.  What it does do however is expedite other possibilities such as bitcoin being used as a global reserve currency to allow say Apple shares be traded for Samsung shares on another exchange without relying on two nation's arbitrary fiat conversions.\n\n\nOverstock does talk about bitcoin a lot, guess they're waiting to have something solid before announcing details of their latest project as others are bound to copy them once they launch.\n": 1}, ('ELI5 request: how does trustless 2-way-peg in sidechains work?

It requires less trust, but many are willing to trade trustlessness for convenience.\n\nThe huge promise of sidechains is a guaranteed system where you can change btc to sidechaintokens at some defined rate at protocol level. For example, if you want to swap btc to protocoltokens, 1 BTC = 0.99 sidechaintoken, and when converting back 1 sidechaintoken = 0.99 BTC. (the fees go to miners or something). At least that\'s how I would\'ve understood the system based on the marketing here on reddit.\n\nIf the rate floats at market, it is not very interesting - transfering value from one cryptocurrency to another is already very easy.': 0, "Also it doesn't guarantee any kind of exchange rate.

Where is then the sidechain 2-way-peg counterpart for the coinbase of the freshly mined Bitcoin block?": 2, 'Hi Jerguismi,\n\nWe wrote an extensive whitepaper which covers the mechanism of the two-way-peg; the transfer mechanism is discussed in section 3. http://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf  I suggest reading more than section 3, however, as it lays out some framework for understanding the rest that follows.\n\nIn the system presented in the paper participants logically move coins into a sidechain by paying them to the control of a smart contract that will release them in the future when given evidence that the other system authorized the release.  If the system is symmetric they then go to the sidechain and present proof that they did this exactly in the same way that they\'d withdraw coins-- they present proof that the main chain authorized the move (in the form of accepting a transaction which assigned the coins to the smart contract).\n\nThis is implemented in the testnet->sidechain direction in [Elements Alpha](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements/),  the scriptPubkey looks like: "OP_IF <lockTxHeight> <lockTxHash> nlocktxOut [<workAmount>] reorgBounty Hash160(<...>) <genesisHash> OP_REORGPROOFVERIFY OP_ELSE withdrawLockTime OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY OP_DROP OP_HASH160 p2shWithdrawDest OP_EQUAL OP_ENDIF".\n\nIn Bitcoin today, particularly because script was hobbled by disabled opcodes, script isn\'t expressive enough to express the required smart contract. It\'s a simple soft-fork to resolve that and almost any major improvement to Script\'s expressive power would be sufficient.  It\'s possible to even completely replace script in Bitcoin, in a fully backwards compatible manner, as we demonstrated with P2SH. All that is required is a demonstrated application, implementation, and the effort to verify.\n\nThis results in a bit of a catch-22, however, because how do you show that something you can\'t do yet really has an application?  Appendix A of the sidechains whitepaper gives an answer: The full system can be deployed and used in some applications using a collection of somewhat trusted functionaries as a protocol adapter. They run the rules that Bitcoin currently doesn\'t enforce, and stand in its stead.  The result is a security trade-off but which is completely permission-less, unblockable, undetectable, and fast to deploy. It allows the community to try things out, mature things, demonstrate demand... then upgrade the security later.\n\nAnd while it\'s a lame half measure, at the same time it\'s a massive security upgrade for many applications. As you many know, many people use Bitcoin services today where they deposit funds into the control of a single operator who could steal the funds, often on a single server which could be compromise (e.g. via datacenter staff or a software vulnerability.).  So even the half-step trial mechanism here, if used in places people use purely centralized services would be a big security upgrade. So I don\'t think anyone who uses or promotes a centralized service should be saying this "isn\'t good"-- it\'s just not a replacement for the full thing.  But it\'s not an either-or, even in elements alpha it\'s already using the trust-less 2WP, but only in one direction right now which demonstrates almost all of the machinery (the missing part right now is the compact representation for the SPV proofs).\n\n> (non-market rate, but somehow programmed or constant)\n\nRight, the rate is assured (up-to frictional offsets) by the fact that the system itself will perform the trades for people... that it will take mainnet-bitcoins, give you sidechain-bitcoins,  or take sidechain-bitcoins and give you mainnet-bitcoins.  Of course, some dim-bulb could always massively over-pay, just as you could buy a bitcoin for two bitcoins; but in an efficient market the price should always be identical +/- small offsets created by demand-time-preference and transaction fees, and if its not someone can make a profit equalizing it.  Similar to how a Bitcoin deposited in foo-exchange is still worth one Bitcoin (but better: foo exchange implies significant counterparty risk that wouldn\'t exist in this environment).\n\nI hope that answers some of your questions.\n': 3, "Sidechain is a special blockchain with some special properties.\n\nWhat happens is that Alice locks her bitcoins by sending a special type of transaction. Then she waits. (This waiting is called an SPV proof (Simplified payment verification proof) because the total difficulty of blocks produced in this waiting time proves that Alice's locking transaction was genuine.)\n\nAfter this waiting time (usually a day or 2, called as confirmation time) is over, Alice announces on the sidechain that her coins are now in the sidechain. She does this by sending a special transaction on the sidechain. Again, she needs to wait for some time as an SPV proof(called as contest period). Thats it. Now her bitcoins are locked and sent to the sidechain and she can transact there. \n\nWhen she (or future owner) requires to send the coins back from the sidechain to bitcoin, all of the above is done again - send the coins on the sidechain to an SPV-locked output, produce a sufficient SPV proof that this was done, and use the proof to unlock a number of previously-locked outputs with equal denomination in bitcoin. \n\nSince someone might also send their litecoins to this sidechain, coins on this sidechain are not fungible & cannot be mixed with each other.": 4, 'One more question, from the sidechains paper: https://blockstream.com/sidechains.pdf\n\nOn the section 3.2, "symmetric two-way peg", there is talk about "special output".

And they didn\'t even try making any calls!': 6, "Phone is rooted, isn't security compromised? Could have been hacked without physical access. ": 8, "Very true. I'm vigilant, but Android makes it extra difficult, and app updates come too often to stay on top of it all.": 3, 'Agree with warnings about root being a bit overblown as it just gives you control to grant permission if you decide, not everything gets root...\n\nOnly a few apps were specifically granted root permission: \nTitanium backup and SSHDroid and betterbattery stats 2.1.0.0_B5 downloaded from xda\n\nNo other apps have been granted permissions for root access. ': 2, 'TBH I think I agree with you here. Almost bought one a few months ago and it would have saved me 5x the cost already. ': 2, "Exactly. In general people are completely paranoid with bitcoins and it's very counterproductive. Fact is the average guy with uptodate software (not running windows xp) is more likely to lose his coins by losing a backup than getting hacked.\n\nMost people who have lost their coins had a unsecure/unecrypted backup of their keys on a online service (dropbox, gmail no 2fa etc.)\n\nIt's actually a good idea to have a good amount of bitcoins like a few hundred dollars on your phone and on your computer with little to no encryption, no better way to know if your device is safe!": 1, 'real quick answer and I\'ll augment when I finish the work I\'m currently doing: It doesn\'t matter if your phone is rooted or not in the chinese case. Or the US, for that matter. Real, legitimate cell towers are often used by countries to intercept communications, install malware, and track foreign persons of interest. They can do whatever they want to your phone even if it\'s not rooted because nation-states have what are called "0-day" exploits.  A 0-day means it\'s an exploit that has been made public for zero days. The good ones, like the ones that allow you to break into and control someone\'s phone or computer cost a lot of money on the black market (I\'ve heard price quotes in the ~$100,000 range for really good exploits) but countries like China, USA, UK, North Korea (you read that right) , and more spend $billions to either find these bugs and create exploits before anyone else knows about them and creates a fix, or they  work with the companies directly or covertly to inject these backdoors. This  was all conspiracy nonsense until the Snowden docs, but now everyone knows at least part of the truth. So it doesn\'t matter if your phone is up to date, patched, running A/V, whatever. If one of those guys want in, they\'re in. \n\n\nBut to answer your question, a few things could happen. You could walk by one of these fake cell towers and then your phone might download and install an update for the mycelium app, with nothing looking out of the ordinary except for the fact that this update steals all of your keys and therefore, all of your coins. \n\nRemember those 0-days I mentioned? If the attacker has found his own 0-day or a public but unpatched vulnerability was announced, they could steal your private keys silently without your phone ever leaving your pocket. If it\'s a really good exploit, this would work even if your phone is brand-new, freshly updated with all security settings configured to their highest level. And it won\'t mean shit. These exploits are really hard to find on your own and are very expensive; over $100,000 for a single exploit. Remember hearing about Stuxnet, that virus that was breaking centrifuges in Iranian  nuclear facilities? That virus had FOUR zero-days. That was one of the red flags that indicated it was was crated by either the US or Israel, and it turned out that both countries worked on it together. \n\nSo yeah, don\'t bring any electronics to China with anything remotely sensitive and when you get back, restore it to its factory settings. After doing that, be sure it actually restored to the factory settings and a backdoor didn\'t sneak by. And with the cheap fake cell towers I was talking about, it also doesn\'t matter much if your phone is rooted. If it\'s an older phone, there\'s a good chance the tower could completely take over it and steal all of the keys. Even if it\'s a newer phone, it\'s still at risk. Its just a bit harder. This is one of the reasons why people recommend not to keep large amount of BTC in your phone\'s wallet. For the time being, they\'re very, very vulnerable. There are hardware security modules that can mitigate the risk but I don\'t think any wallets use that yet.\n\nSame advice goes for Chinese people coming to the US. "Oh, a Chinese national is coming to study computer security at MIT?" You can bet anything electronic that person owns like their phone, computer, xbox, whatever, is being scoured by analysts in windowless secure rooms in the DC metro area.\n\nBTW I lied, I\'m not augmenting this. I wrote way more than I intended :)': 5, 'Did you have a password on it? / was it encrypted?': 1, 'Any other app installed can be a spyware disguised in a flashlight or game app... That one easily can track your keys, files, bakups etc.  \nI suggest to re-ROM that phone with latest CM. A simple factory reset is not enough. A davlik wipe cache is better.  \nIn CM you have the option also to block all the access default for all apps so you can see what they want to access when is started. CM I think is the best custom ROM for Android. I never trusted the "original" ROMs for any Android phone. I always wipe everything from a new phone and install a latest CM. Then activate the all security access. So then never had problems with anything. Of course I don\'t install stupid games or flashlights on my phone.': 10, "Agree. Thank you for noting this. I'm going to look into how to encrypt the SD card, though, if this is happening from a malicious app, that won't help. \n\nI would have expected Ti backup, a granddaddy and one of the most expensive apps in the Play Store to provide better security than that. I'll look into whether backups can be encrypted/PW protected (which I assume would have helped, though, we're not getting any closer, here, as a malicious app would have had 2FA access on a rooted phone (assuming, of course, that that app was given root access)).\n\nKeep trying to nail down the attack vector.": 1, "Elic.

Even if Mycelium is extremely secure, giving a program like Cyanogenmod root access can allow for other, malicious applications from accessing data they shouldn't, like maybe your private keys. Your PINs aren't much help BTW. Even if they implemented the key derivation function correctly, which they probably didn't (based on my personal experience of performing penetration tests on several dozen apps), some other malicious code could be intercepting your key once it's been generated and stored in memory.
