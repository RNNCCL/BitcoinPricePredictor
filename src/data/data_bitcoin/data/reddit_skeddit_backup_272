Turns out segregated witness can be done as a soft fork without changing how txids are calculated. Do a P2SH-like construction committing to the hash of the redeem script: unlike P2SH, it becomes a consensus rule that the spending txin's scriptSig is empty. The _actual_ scriptSig (with the redeem script) is committed to somewhere else in the block and transmitted alongside the transaction and the block which includes. The scriptSig isn't contained within the transaction anymore, so it isn't part of the data that is hashed to get the txid. This is an equivalently powerful form of segregated witness as the hard-fork variant in Sidechain Elements, but easier to deploy to Bitcoin Core and the new transaction semantics can be safely ignored (with SPV security) by older clients.": 4, "It'd be a potentially messy hardfork. Every transaction after the block of the hard fork would now have its transaction hash calculated differently, yet they'd have to reference transaction hashes that are calculated differently.\n\nThere's this urge to fix as many things as possible with a single hardfork, but the truth is that designing specifications and implementations to address myriad different issues will cause such a time delay that the blockchain will probably suffer before the original issue, block size limitations, is corrected. A better solution is a system which is designed to more adequately handle hard forks in the future. The current design of Bitcoin may not be amenable to such a democratic future in new feature subsets.": 2, 'Seg. witness IMO seems less controversial than confidential values.

Since you\'re changing a pretty low-level part of how bitcoin stores and references transactions, it\'s a whole lot of different code and a relatively ugly hard fork.  If bitcoin had SegWit from the start it\'d be quite simple.\n\nSomething like SIGHASH_NOINPUT on the other hand, could be put in as a soft-fork.  It\'s not as clean in some ways, in that it isn\'t compatible with address re-use, but it\'s a much smaller modification to the existing code.': 1, "But it doesn't have all the benefits. Segregated witness, for example, allows the signatures to be dropped entirely from the initial block download, if they aren't going to be checked anyway (e.g. because they are before the most recent checkpoint). This is even more beneficial with technology like confidential transactions which stuffs a whole lot of other info into the signature script. Right now pruned nodes syncing the block chain download 10's of gigabytes of data that is hashed once and thrown away. Segregated witness gets rid of this waste (in addition to definitively solving third-party malleability); SIGHASH_NOINPUT does not.": 5, 'It would help, yes.': 2, "Why did 'confidential values' (confidential transactions?) enter this discussion? More to the point, what makes confidential transactions 'more controversial'? Do you mean from a pov of resource requirement (16x larger transaction size according to u/nullc recently), or something else? Just curious.": 1, "In principle, yes, and it would be an improvement. Indeed one could argue that segregated witness is how bitcoin should have been constructed from the get-go. It is qualitatively better in every way without any downsides. BTW there are other changes that slipped from alpha and which will hopefully be in the next release that provide other benefits that are better in every way over the status quo, so this isn't unique to segregated witness.\n\nHowever Satoshi did not have the foresight to build bitcoin in these ways :( It is the simple truth that any change made to bitcoin must come with transition support. And unfortunately not only are these changes hard forks, but as hard forks go they are very hard. Any code that computes or verifies transaction IDs -- which is just about all code out there -- would need to be upgraded. This is in contrast to say a block size increase that would be wholely invisible to SPV nodes.\n\nSorry to bring that topic in, but now that it has been broached.. one of the reasons that I am personally advocating for a measured, carefully thought out approach to the block size increase is that if we do our job right we can get a number of these uncontroversial, everyone benefits hard forks in too. We might not get another chance at making such changes. But that said, it think it would be unlikely that segregated witness would be among these changes as its infrastructure impact does make it controversial :(\n\nEdit: to elaborate, the issue is that the Merkle tree proofs used by SPV wallets to prove inclusion of a transaction in a block would no longer validate when segregated witness was turned on, because the hash of the transaction would be different.": 12, 'As a feature, yes. But I expect there would be a lot of pushback from all the infrastructure developers that would have to update their code...

Transitioning from the current txid setup to Segregated Witness is tricky though.\n\nOne risk of SIGHASH_NOINPUT being adopted first would be that it may reduce motivation for adoption of segregated witness, which would be disappointing.  So it seems like a trade-off: SIGHAHSH_NOINPUT could likely get in to nodes quicker, segregated witness would probably take longer.  If either gets adopted, it reduces the likelihood of the other being adopted.\n\nI'd personally like to see NOINPUT get in sooner, and then segregated witness into a later hard-fork.

": 3, 'I did read it, and found it painfully *one*-dimensional.  \n  \nHere\'s a summary of those arguments (or sides):  \n  \n-------------------  \n  \n*Side 1: Merchants will adopt Bitcoin because more customers hold Bitcoins*  \n  \nMerchants *can\'t* adopt bitcoin because it is crippled by a tiny transaction volume, so what will they do once another crypto (with better features and the ability to scale dynamically) starts to make significant network gains on Bitcoin?\n  \n--------------------  \n  \n*Side 2: Customers will adopt Bitcoin because more merchants accept Bitcoins*  \n  \nThis is the most basic form of the network argument: customers will continue to use MySpace because lots of people use MySpace.  \n  \n-------------------------  \n  \n*Side 3: Developers will adopt Bitcoin because more customers and merchants use Bitcoins.   Note that in a complex regulated financial product like Bitcoin, this does not only relate to the applications existing, but reaching scale, going through trial-by-fire, proving their trustworthiness, gaining regulatory approval and so on.*  \n  \nMore wishful thinking: "customers trust Blackberry phones and the existing user base makes it an unassailable force in the mobile world."  \n  \nNote that I didn\'t say bitcoin would die completely, but due to its public blockchain there are *entire classes* of applications that aren\'t possible on the bitcoin blockchain.  \n  \nYou will see development continue for a while, and I would say bitcoin is a pretty safe spot for your crypto holdings, but to think that developers would develop for a clearly superior platform is silly.  Tell me this: if Android has more users, then why is their App Store a pale and shallow imitation of the iOS App store then?  Because developers don\'t necessarily develop where the most users are, but rather where there are the most profits to be made.  \n  \n-------------------------  \n  \n*Side 4:  All the parties in 1-3 adopting Bitcoin creates demand for the currency, causing its price to rise, making mining rewards more valuable, drawing miners and their computational power to the currency and therefore making the blockchain more secure against a fatal 51% attack.*  \n  \nWhat the fuck is this?  Yes, price is a function of popularity in a financial network (to some degree), but that isn\'t some extra \'side\' you can just invoke.  This is retarded nonsense.  \n  \nWith bitcoin there are little/no block rewards after a few more halvings so the bitcoin users better *hope* that their network grows extremely popular because otherwise they will see their network rapidly become worthless.  \n  \nA transaction-fee based system only works if the users are willing to pay significant transaction fees.  \n  \nMeanwhile Monero has a perpetual blocksize reward so there will always be new Monero to mine - once again, a better system that better rewards miners.  Why wouldn\'t miners choose a superior system?  \n  \n-------------------------  \n  \n*Side 5: Adoption by the ecosystem plus the security of a strong blockchain, draws pure financial investors to the currency, who push the price up, drawing more miners.*  \n  \nMore nonsense.  That\'s like saying that because Facebook has a lot of stock holders nothing can ever supplant them.  And if you really do want to invoke this foolish argument then all it should take it one big price rise and speculatory rush and any blockchain (including Monero) would have a huge lead on taking down the #1 crypto.  \n  \n------------------------  \n  \n*Side 6:  More adoption plus better financial institutions ("Side 3") means more liquidity running through the exchanges that exchange Bitcoins back and forth to sovereign currency, which reduces the spreads to exchange into/out of the currency and making it more cost-effective for customers, merchants, developers and investors to use it.   (Spreads to sovereign currencies are the main transaction costs in any cryptocurrency, far outweighing the currencies internal transaction fees).*  \n  \nThis is where the article writer goes full retard and doesn\'t just restate that because more people are using bitcoin, lots of people are using bitcoin.  No, he goes further and says that because lots of people are changing dollars into bitcoins, no one will ever want to change dollars directly into another crypto.  \n  \nIs his argument that the path of bitcoin is to play nice with the US Dollar?  \n  \nIn short, this is a silly and absurd bit of make-believe from someone who understands very little about consumers, technology adoption (and disruption), and it likely to have the wind knocked out of him once the BTC->XMR rate begins to rapidly equalize.  \n  \n-----------------  \n  \n- Why would we ever develop a second religion once the first one was good enough?  \n- Why would we ever develop a second dominant language on Earth if the first one was good enough?  \n- Why would we have multiple social networks for various purposes if Facebook is the most popular?  \n- PayPal is far more accepted than Bitcoin and already works with existing US Dollars.

Whatever you think of Goldman Sachs, they are not stupid. Far, far from it.

Yes, you can\'t separate bitcoin from the blockchain IF a, b, c. If you don\'t care about a, b, c the of course you can.\n\nPersonally, I believe in both and I don\'t see any conflict there. Bitcoin will continue to grow for what it was designed to do and permissioned systems will get adoption for what they were designed to do. One day maybe bitcoin will adapt and solve for some of the issues that prevent banks from using it and then maybe they will. Maybe it won\'t and they won\'t.

As the co-author of Lightning Network, I\'ve been paying attention to the possible fixes for a while.\n\nThere are some fixes in the pipeline that should mitigate malleability for cooperative multisig (BIP 62). This doesn\'t help if you don\'t have control of all the keys, though, which defeats a lot of the fun in multisig. BIP 62 is nice because it reduces confusion and the potential prolem space so it should go in. \n\nWith adversarial multisig where you cannot instruct all keys to resign, proposed OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY and using the nSequence in various ways are in the pipeline. They should mitigate some aspects of malleability for refund but are a partial malleability solution, as the resolution to malleability is a refund which requires restarting the transactions entirely later. They are nice to have for various reasons and should absolutely go in Bitcoin, as they enable a lot of cool things. The threat for adversarial mutlisig malleability is that your funds can be locked up forever (and be put into a hostage situation by the other party, e.g. "I\'ll release your funds and give you a partial refund if I steal some of your money"), which OP_CLTV and nSequence fixes helps resolve as at least you can program it to give a refund after a set period of time).\n\nTo truly solve malleability, it requires something like a new SIGHASH flag, which could be implemented as a new P2SH state. Me and /u/Dryja have suggested that as an ideal solution. (along with the previously proposed OP_CLTV and relative locktime soft-forks). This allows you to spend from any transaction where your signature fits. However, this needs to be a non-default option which needs to be turned on (which is why it should be a SIGHASH flag), as it [breaks address reuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ng4p9/why_is_bitcoin_protocol_not_fixed_against_tx/cvnt57y), so only adversarial multisig situations and bitcoin company wallets should use it (i.e. not everyday bitcoin transactions from end-user wallets). For Lightning in particular, this helps with easing the amount of computation necessary (especially for small devices) and outsourcing checking the channel for you for offline clients.\n\nThe proposed changes are fairly easy in the sense that they are very few lines of code.

There are efforts that I often read about where people are working on identity systems that would use the blockchain. In my opinion, identity is built upon a consensus of trust. Like it or not, trust is more often the appearance of something. More people are going to trust your passport and swisssign cert than a picture on bitfin with a handwritten note identifying a block in the blockchain. PKI doesn't always imply trust either, I can create my own PKI today, but that doesn't mean that anyone will trust it. Verisign has PKI, why do I trust verisign, because they're a company? Companies and governments can become corrupt, purchased, or fail. The blockchain is more resistant to those factors, but has other risks. I think it would be interesting to have an identity system based on a blockchain, but hardly anyone understands it to trust it yet. Likely anyone that creates an identity system on top of the blockchain would be centralized with a website and way to show/visualize the relationship, which has the same weaknesses as other systems. For now, I think these blockchain identity systems aren't very useful. Interesting, but not useful as of today.": 1, 'Doesn\'t this mean that these proofs-of-identity would be inextricably mixed in with the transaction record?

You would need to go through some KYC verification to add some extra layer of authentication, but most KYC providers don't verify whether you're a globally unique person either. Moreover, you would also have to handle the cases of losing access to the private keys and so on.\n\nHaving people vouch for you can be subverted by a sybil attack. Perhaps it would be less vulnerable if instead you created some web-of-trust model where you only consider someone to be real if there is some unbroken trust line between the two of you, etc.\n\nAll in all, I doubt a system like this would be too useful or complete without being a part of a national identity system.": 2, "You can choose freely with the PKI.

I have a keypair bound to my legal identity with the private key stored inside a smartcard/USB key. It cost me about 70 Swiss Francs and involved going to a post office with a simple form and my passport. The smartcard generated the private key once it was used for the first time, and the resulting certificate was signed by SwissSign. It took a couple of minutes and I use it to sign documents, mostly PDFs. But it's all based on open protocols so could be used to sign other things, like BIP70 payment requests.\n\nI understand that most people have never used the PKI outside of making SSL connections, but there is no need for new infrastructure or block chains here.

That's .00145228% of the world's wealth. So, assuming 21 million bitcoins (not true at the moment, and given losses, ever), it would suggest 304.98 BTC would put you in the top 500.\n\n[Forbes estimated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World%27s_Billionaires_2015) There were 1826 billionaires in 2015- that is, owning .00041493% of the world's wealth put you at number 1826. 87.1353 BTC would put you in the top 1826 globally.\n\n[Credit suisse estimates] (http://www.businessinsider.com/where-the-worlds-ultra-high-net-worth-live-2014-10) 128,000 individuals with wealth exceeding $50 million.

So should you if you can\'t figure that out\n\nYou guys are so deluded you don\'t even see it. There could be a debate over "invest the money" vs. "You\'re young, buy yourself some amazing experiences" but in the bitcoin subreddit the \'advice\' is essentially "buy $10,000 worth of lottery tickets but without even getting the funny gas station instagram photo out of the deal"': -5, 'I think I should. You can\'t give terrible advice to an earnest kid and then say "jeez guys lighten up, just my opinion".... bad advice has real consequences for the recipient. I even did ddepra the service of explaining how his advice was bad. ': -8, 'Buy a trezor or other hardware wallet and take possession of your coins asap ': 51, "+1 to the trezor. Its easy to use, and follows common daughter-address trees so you know that the 12-24 word code you make at the very beginning can always restore your coins if you lose the device or it fails on you.\n\nand then to spend coins is easy and extremely secure because you don't worry about scanning paper wallets or exposing yourself to a vulnerable computer (such as bitcoin-stealing malware)\n\nI say buy a trezor and make two accounts (different passwords), one holds 10-20% of your coins and uses a password you can remember or otherwise commonly use. This is the decoy. The second password is more complex/unusual and holds 50-60% of your bitcoins. In the case of theft or coersion, you could protect the bulk of your assets by giving up the 'decoy'. then put the remaining 20-40% into paper wallets and/or digital media (microsd or usb), ideally with a password (BIP32) and tuck them away safely.\n\nyou may even consider n-of-m in future, and distribute the parts to trusted people or locations around your house.": 3, 'Trezor is great for long term storage that you can use every now and then without having to re-set-up your entire security method every time you spend from it.\n\nNext best thing would be iPhone + breadwallet, which should be fine unless super amounts of tinfoil hat are necessary.': 2, "Yea, okay we're on the same page with that distinction. \n\nAdvice is opinion, you're entitled to think ddepra is giving bad advice, but I don't think you should bad-mouth him for it.": 4, "I do know my shit. I said electronic shit breaks. That was a factual statement. \n\nSo I recommend using the single most widespread option for creating paper wallets in the entire Bitcoin ecosystem (bitaddress.org) and I get 12 downvotes for it? How many of you work for Trezor again?\n\nWhy would I need to pay a hundred dollars for some device when I can just print it out on a piece of paper for free?\n\nSuper duper! You can also back up your private key.  Or you can just go print one out right away for free. \n\nTurns out I know my shit still. Haven't seen any comments proving otherwise.  Still waiting to hear why your $100 breakable electronic device is more secure than a free piece of paper.  And spare me the stories of houses burning down, or floods.\n\nSo many Trezor shills on this sub it's nuts. ": 3, "Sucks you got downvoted. There's a lot of bandwagon voting lately. I don't think you got downvoted just for saying electronic shit breaks though. \n\nBitaddress.org would have been my initial suggestion too, but I like the breadwallet and Trezor suggestions a bit more. The problem for most people when it comes to paper wallets is air-gapping. It's not immediately obvious since almost all devices are online these days. The tech savvy won't have any issues with booting from a live CD and printing backups, but it's a lot of effort. Also, once you have a lot of paper wallets, they can be a pain to manage. The effort is probably worth the cost of a Trezor for some, but not for everyone. \n\nThe Trezor has the added benefit of spending securely and retrieving new addresses easily, without any air-gapping necessary. Breaking or losing the device is not a concern if you have a proper backup, same as a paper wallet. \n\nCall me a Trezor shill if you want, but I think they're great little devices. Maybe a little pricy, but I got a 3-pack so they were about $80 each. The convenience and peace of mind is well worth the cost. The only thing I really want is the ability to query my own full node for address balances. This isn't possible with Electrum unless you're running Electrum Server, and there's no hardware wallet support for Bitcoin Core or Armory either. In that sense, paper wallets are superior to Trezors when it comes to privacy.": 4, 'Check out Circle withdrawal limits': 1, 'The reason I bash electronic storage devices is because I had a shit ton of coins in BitcoinQT back in the day, and though everyone was using it without any problems, mine somehow "broke". \n\nI did some weird USB transferring back-and-forth on and off the drive, and when I tried to pull that wallet.dat File back in to QT, it wouldn\'t import. My other dat file imported but the passphrase was changed by a bug in the software.\n\nI literally almost lost $100,000 that day.  This was back when BTC was $1,100.  \n\nTo say I almost shit my pants, would be an understatement. The only way I saved it was that I had deleted a copy of the same DAT file and it was still sitting in my recycle bin on my Windows machine. So I restored that one which hadn\'t been moved around via USB, and it imported successfully. If I had cleared out my recycle bin, it all would have been gone.  \n\nThat\'s when I decided I would never, ever trust my life savings to some piece of software that could have bugs, or some electronic medium that could break. Not during the "wild west" stage of bitcoin at least. Maybe in the future when huge institutions have a great reputation, and insurance against loss.\n\nBut until then, there\'s no way I\'m putting my funds at the mercy of someone else\'s programming skills or some devices ability to keep functioning.  With paper wallets, I retain 100% control, and also 100% responsibility. If something goes wrong, it\'s my own fault. And if I don\'t screw up, nothing does go wrong. Which is more than I can say when I\'m at the mercy of software, or some hardware.': 2, "I don't think gambling sites have ever scammed.
