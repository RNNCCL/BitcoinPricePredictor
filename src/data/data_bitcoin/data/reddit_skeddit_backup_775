Sure, usage there was voluminous and the PR pervasive, but this author has misrepresented the story. It is no secret that criminals are usually the first to adopt nascent technology. Does that make them any more important than anyone else in the history of technology? Probably not.\n\nAnyway, prior to the Silk Road, trade of illicit goods on the internet happened largely with currencies like E-Gold and Liberty Reserve, although there were lesser known public marketplaces that used Bitcoin. Apparently the author didn\'t witness those marketplaces, so they must not have occurred nor did they play a role in Silk Road\'s ideation. /s\n\nHad DPR attempted to create the Silk Road with centralized currencies, it would never have flourished (I use the word loosely, since so many of the vendors/admins are now in jail) in such a public manner. Thus the Silk Road didn\'t "make" Bitcoin, Bitcoin made the Silk Road. Bitcoin is good for censorship free movement of funds. Silk Road happened to build on that foundation and pointed interested parties in the right direction. But to assume that Bitcoin would not have flourished without the Silk Road is missing the point.\n\nIn reality this article reads more like hyperbole, self aggrandizement and romanticization of the DPR character than a critical look at Bitcoin\'s history. For example:\n\n> It opened its doors like any ordinary business. It let people interact without fear.\n\nOh really? I wonder what the vendors/admins/DPR are thinking as they sit in jail right now. And do you think the buyers on SR2 are fearless as their plaintext addresses are being pored over by the FBI and friends?\n\n>The more accessible to ordinary people that illegal drugs become, and the more that the drug market can operate like an ordinary business, the less will people be able to maintain a conceptual separation between recreational drugs and other business. \n\nDo you think Blake Benthall agrees with that?\n\nThe real heroes of Bitcoin are the people maintaining and working on the plumbing. DPR was nothing more than an opportunist in the right place at the right time.

The attacker can constantly scan the list of I2P nodes (which is public) and keep track of when nodes are down at the same time as your eepsite. This is called an intersection attack. (I2P actually has a mode where you *do not* run as a normal network node for just this reason, though a powerful attacker will still be able to figure out that you're using I2P by running many I2P nodes and seeing who they connect to.)\n\nI2P is technologically very similar to Tor. Any attack against Tor is likely to also work against I2P.\n\nUnfortunately, I don't believe that any anonymity network in existence today is secure enough to completely rely on for anonymity. You should use the anonymity network, but assume that it will fail completely and plan accordingly.": 1, 'Ultimate solution.': 1, "Torrents use UDP which Tor doesn't support, it is by design - because you can't rewrite the UDP packets and they'll lead to the user being deanonymized. A low latency onion routing network is not the use case for anonymizing Torrent usage.\n\nI2P has nowhere near as many relays, Tor is at 6k+ relays, 4k+ bridges and 1k+ exits. I2P could have 10x more users than Tor and it wouldn't matter, since the DHT only exposes 20, 30 or 40 nodes to the user at a time - which is what makes i2p more vulnerable to Sybil attacks. Tor users can build circuits using any of the available 6k relays.\n\ni2p's strength with eepsites is with those hosting the sites - in that case it is *much* better than hidden sites - but the difference for users is different.

OP's original point about relays makes no sense. My impression from this and other threads is that most of the i2p advocacy is based on misinformation. \n\nTo give you an idea of where the projects are in respect to one another: 3 months ago i2p had a bug in the implementation that allowed remote exec. It was the first time Tails was hit with 0day and was exploited to deanonymize users. This is the type of bug you find in poor software or in alpha software - not in production software and certainly not in security software. i2p is *still in development*.\n\nTor, on the other hand, is dealing with attack types at a level that require solutions that address core problems in computer science and research - such as graph based and correlation/timing attacks. \n\nI don't dislike i2p, I use it all the time and follow the project closely and can see how it would eventually fit into the ecosystem - but this constant mention of i2p as a saving grace to Tor is completely baffling to anybody familiar with both projects.

A good which slowly and linearly (or market driven somehow) increases in supply may be more "tradeable" -- and won\'t completely wipe out savings in it. Everyone would in some sense like to give a depreciating good for an appreciating one -- a good which grows linearly in supply may be more acceptable to both parties of a trade.

No one could blame you as you have certainly done more than your part to bring about freedom. But when game changers come along so does the opportunity to change the world in more than one theater.\n\nThe power of disruptive technologies is more than the immediate shift in terms of old technology to new, the old ideas with new ideas, but also a social shift in power replacing the old guard with those that have new world views. Rarely is it ever discussed how the old world views maintain their hold on us all. The creative destruction of the market place is the only force (other than war) that transitions old mindsets out and new ones into real positions of power. Your ideas are important. Your concerns are important. I would even suggest that your whimsies are important. Might I suggest that your windfall be taken to the next level?\n\nYour decision to stay anonymous clearly says that you don\xe2\x80\x99t desire power. Right now you are a mysterious anomaly to most. Please consider raising your star just a little further in case your anonymity is threatened. Your reputation and influence could be used to truly change the world. It is a rare event when someone that understands the importance and the power of crypto currencies achieves the leverage that you currently possess. Use that leverage! Create prizes to further your goals. The X-prize is the recent best example of the successful implementation of a tech prize. This concept provides many advantages that you should consider. First and foremost until the milestone is reached you control the money. Second the prize encourages and provides immediate financial motivation to solve the problem. Third the prize requires an open announcement of accomplishing the goal thus overcoming the dangerous power concentrations likely in defense funded projects. Finally prizes create their own media buzz and actually encourage scientists, technologists, and most important of all enthusiasts to focus on the issue.\n\nRight now there are fields on the cusp of breakthroughs. These fields require additional manpower but more importantly they require fresh perspectives. Prizes encourage outsiders with out- of- the- box thinking to examine the issue. More importantly the human species needs these new frontiers to survive. Molecular manipulation, space travel, portable energy, cryonics, life-extension, and retaining anonymity in the digital realm are all areas that could transform our civilization. With such technological shifts come social shifts and old guard social systems despite their historical momentum can then be replaced by better alternatives.\n\nThe technology already exists where you can have an impact and keep your anonymity. With a Tor hidden service, you can create anonymous websites that promote your prizes. Announce a public key with an account linked to Satoshi Nakamoto and you are verified as the \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d SN participating in the prize along with the ability to communicate anonymously.\n\nI write this letter out of shear selfishness. Despite the delusions of politicians and the media\xe2\x80\x99s talking heads we don\xe2\x80\x99t live in a free world. I want to live in a free world where all individuals have the core right of self determination. We need to use these frontiers that anonymity provides to create that free world now.\n\nAs governments realize the implications to innovations such as Bitcoin and Tor, they will react in fear. Massive data collection is simply the first step. As anonymous activity becomes more technologically assured they will create new laws and harsh penalties for anonymous behaviors. I believe that many of us will continue to strive for freedom and frontiers. But I fear these new laws will create a terrible body count along the way. This is the path that we are currently on and I hope with your help to avoid.\n\nI know that it is not a pleasant thought but please consider the likelihood that your identity will eventually be revealed.
