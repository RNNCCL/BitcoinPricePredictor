If the miners all of the sudden can only produce half as much, and the buyers still want the same amount, then the price must go up.': 1, 'Haha the doublethink is real with them.': 2, 'Seems like a pretty sound analysis, detractor or not, and I consider myself a proponent.': 1, '"Detractors"? Of what?  \n\nIt is a fact that the last halving (on 2012-11-26) did not have any visible effect on the price, that remained flat for another 5 weeks.  (A new bubble started on 2013-01-06, but there is no evidence that it was connected to the halving, and some evidence that it was due to demand in China.)\n\nOne explanation for that lack of reaction is that the miners were still operating at a large profit, so they were saving a large part of their coins.  After the halving, they continued selling the same amount to pay expenses, and either saved less, or started to spend their hoarded coins.\n\nIf the price does not rise before the next halving, the situation will be quite different.  Mining is much more an industrial activity that cannot just operate at a loss "for the good of bitcoin".  It is widely believed that, after 15 months of price decline, the miners who are still operating are barely making a profit, so they must be selling almost all of their coins.  The next halving may therefore force many of them to turn their equipment off, and those that remain will be selling only half as many coins per day as they used to.  So the price may start climbing after the halving, until a new equilibrium is reached.  It does not seem likely that the price will double, though.\n\nHowever, over those last 15 months, the price has dropped ~9% per month, on the average, even though the supply of mined coins was constant all that time.  The mined coins cannot be blamed for all that loss.  So, it is impossible to tell what will happen to the price after the next halving.': 0, 'but litecoin will never go up unless bitcoin does thats what history says': 1, 'I am a "detractor" of bitcoin, yes.

Just paying for electricity using bitcoins mined would lead to most of the bitcoins being sold.  Approximately 3600 coins mined each day, with most being sold, creates some downward price pressure.

This is only one factor of many, and markets tend to anticipate these types of events, especially when it is a known event like this.

The most relevant to the bitcoin community is that having such a centralized system of trade puts a ton of power in its administrators; ebay itself is not short on issues. Any sort of institution with the power to monitor and maintain ratings and escrows, etc., could abuse that power (much as certain review sites are known to post bad reviews on businesses that don\'t pay membership fees). \n\nMore relevant to business in general is that there\'s a much higher degree of trust required in a business relationship (B2B) than in most consumer (B2C and C2C) relationships, because of the much greater costs. You may trust ebay sellers, with zero recourse to aid if they betray that trust, but you are likely not spending huge portions of your income on single trades over ebay. Businesses may take on contracts that could put them under if they go awry, or at the least, lead to massive negative consequences. \n\nMany of the systems that can protect consumer relationships are poorly suited to businesses. For example, with a rating system, this is not a large problem to ebay sellers, as they can make smaller initial sales without a preexisting rating, until they establish their quality. Such a rating system, however, could destroy new and small businesses who only have a few large contracts, or who haven\'t done any work yet at all. If the market trusts the ratings, they would lose business; if the market doesn\'t trust the ratings, they are useless as a system for preventing fraud and bad faith actors. The same applies in an escrow system; this may work well for small purchases made by consumers, but it is very poorly suited to large transactions between businesses, where the quick and efficient flow of goods and capital can be vital for achieving the aims of the contract. \n\nLastly, the contractual and other legal relationships (for example, intellectual property dispute) between various companies can be extremely complicated. The tech industry is a big example of this; you may see two or three branches of Microsoft and Google suing each other over some IP dispute, while other branches are coordinating and working together. Persons, natural and legal, may have ongoing disputes with parties they otherwise cooperate with; contractual disputes are often not as simple as the "Buy and Sell" model would seem, but exist within complicated relationships (labor, rental, lease, insurance, utilities and other services, construction, to name a few). eBay ratings are used in a very simple manner of trade--one party sells and delivers an item to another in a given market; they then report the results of this trade (quality of product and delivery, as well as any bad faith from the other party) to the administrator of that market. It\'s not clear this could be easily extended to more complicated contractual relationships (where there isn\'t a clear market administrator to report to, nor a clear start/end to the contractual relationship), especially where a bad faith actor may begin many relationships to drive their rating up, and exploit the system to take the money and run (as often happens with various frauds such as ponzi schemes)': 1, '> we have work-saving technology and decentralized information now.\n\nAnd most of it has gone into pyramid-structure organizations like corporations.

Critiques which focus on \'what it is\' vs. of \'what it can be\' are maddeningly short-sighted, especially given context of TPS and block-size debates. Can we call bitcoin unscalable because it currently only has 1mb blocks? 7 TPS? That is only takes any two pools colluding to execute a critical double-spend? \n  \nRipple\'s [testnet](http://rippletest.net) is already exploring the possible decentralization and incentivization models which have the potential to easily outstrip the unchecked bitcoin mining arms race in terms of "decentralization" were it to be measured quantitatively in terms of unique actors, all while costing orders of magnitude less to run. i.e. a full node can be run with typical [desktop](https://ripple.com/dev-blog/rippled-validator-hardware-requirements/) for less than 300$ per month.\n\n  \nAA and others have consistently sought to stretch this characterization of "centralized" and apply it in ways that are simply not true despite several ironies. Andreas\' specific example in your interview, that Ripple has a switch they centrally control which they can throw at any time, on any account is pure fabrication, freeze flags exist to enable gateways to perform a function on the protocol which in the Bitcoin ecosystem is handled off-chain on private exchange systems, the freeze-flag is therefore a more transparent and accountable compliance feature than bitcoin\'s own system. Piles of comments on twitter misrepresenting the FinCEN ruling as "impossible to happen to bitcoin" are also false, any bitcoin broker who sold 250K of bitcoin without DD would or has (Charlie, DPR, etc) faced similar fines or worse. Misrepresenting the portion of the settlement which resulted in protocol revisions as an example of direct government control is also fictitious, because ther were actually offered by Ripple to ease implementation of live compliance tools they developed for banks which are simply a way to better understand information already available on an open and transparent ledger. The separation of validator and caretaker is not *yet* existent, but is in fact baked in and not the opposite.\n\nAndreas\' focus on blacklisting is indeed a critical discussion for bitcoin community to have because the fact remains that Bitcoin is less fungible than Ripple. Ripple is a deterministic, account based ledger - double spends are impossible and XRP in any account is not unique. Whereas bitcoin relies on unspent transaction outputs, so every bitcoin is traceable through every address in its entire history and could, with proper tools like the ones Ripple enacted or extensions of Blockchain.io\'s products, result in lienable assets. This would break the desired economic model bitcoin was designed to operate as "digital cash". imo, this is why the bitlicense is so scary, it recognizes that even wallets can operate and should potentially be regulated as MSBs.

With Ripple, that seperate does not exist and so it might as well be a centralized system because the developing company truly is the giant central point of failure whose removal from the ecosystem would basically cause the ecosystem to fail.\n\nMy argument was and has been that, technically, ripple is a decentralized protocol but thats based on a somewhat limited understanding of their consensus mechanism, I didnt realize they had essentially hardcoded the validating nodes to majorly ones they control.   I didn\'t realize they were doing bulk sales of the underlying token through a subsidiary company to investors while on the other hand saying the token is an anti-spam mechanism\n\nAll of those things mean that yeah, basically ripple and XRP are centralized - they just created a centralized system that looks decentralized unless you understand it intimately and know who is filling the various roles.   \n': 1, "Want to talk to me and/or andreas about this?

Sooner or later, one day, this pounding action will cease of its own accord, and the blood will begin to run toward the body\'s lowest point, where it will collect in a small pool, visible from outside as a dark, soft patch on ever whitening skin, as the temperature sinks, the limbs stiffen and the intestines drain. These changes in the first hours occur so slowly and take place with such inexorability that there is something almost ritualistic about them, as though life capitulates according to specific rules, a kind of gentleman\'s agreement to which the representatives of death also adhere, inasmuch as they always wait until life has retreated before they launch their invasion of the new landscape. By which point, however, the invasion is irrevocable. The enormous hordes of bacteria that begin to infiltrate the body\'s innards cannot be halted. Had they but tried a few hours earlier, they would have met with immediate resistance; however everything around them is quiet now, as they delve deeper and deeper into the moist darkness. They advance on the Havers Channels, the Crypts of Lieberk\xc3\xbchn, the Isles of Langerhans. They proceed to Bowman\'s Capsule in the Renes, Clark\'s Column in the Spinalis, the black substance in the Mesencephalon. And they arrive at the heart. As yet, it is intact, but deprived of the activity to which end its whole construction has been designed, there is something strangely desolate about it, like a production plant that workers have been forced to flee in haste, or so it appears, the stationary vehicles shining yellow against the darkness of the forest, the huts deserted, a line of fully loaded cable-buckets stretching up the hillside.

Charity is not a sustainable model. Ultimately to eliminate artificial scarcity (blocksize caps) will require all resources in the network to be incorporated into the price system. The way to eliminate the tragedy of the commons is to eliminate the commons.\n\nTOTC is a favorite excuse for central planning, but it\'s a fallacy. There is no "charity" and no commons here. Running a node gives a Bitcoin-related service the individual benefit of faster and safer verification. As adoptions grows, the number of nodes will grow naturally just due to the law of large numbers. Even enthusiasts count too, they run nodes for themselves, not for "society". \n\nWider adoption = more business, more miners, more enthusiasts, more nodes.

Think of MtGox users unable to withdraw their money.\n\n> Bandwidth matters, too. Then there\'s the UTXO/RAM issue.\n\nIncreasing the cap will not suddenly make you require a higher bandwidth. It took 5 years for blocks to raise to 0.4 MB despite the 1MB limit. Quite possible blocks will not increase to 20MB in the next 10 years. \n\nBitcoin growth can\'t be always exponential, and progress never stops. Long term wise, bandwidth/storage/ram/whatever is not an issue.\n\n> The skeptic argument is that rogue miners creating huge blocks could put smaller miners out of business because they aren\'t able to keep up, but 1MB is too small to do this, whereas 20MB perhaps isn\'t.\n\nThe more I think of this theory, the sillier it looks to me. \n\nIt costs money. The smaller blocks are, the less the effect. To make some harm on others, you need really huge blocks. Skeptics were saying about 1GB blocks to prove the point. And then a) it costs more money to you. b) other miners can set soft limits to ignore unusually large blocks. c) other miners can start doing the same against you. Essentially, it\'s the "the war of all against all" argument.

It needlessly opens Bitcoin up to the following risks:\n\n* Fast large scale adoption causing the number of transactions to explode and overwhelm the bandwidth capacity of most nodes, leaving Bitcoin centralized because few nodes are left, exactly at a moment when Bitcoin is in the limelight and will have the full attention of many governments. Absolutely a situation to avoid. If fast adoption were to happen, I'd rather see it slowed down because of block size constraints such that most nodes will be able to keep running.\n\n* Induced demand: a large block size might attract Bitcoin-alien data in the blockchain (for instance storing images, videos, texts, proofs of existence etc.) that are perceived to be feasible given the 20 MB block size.\n": 4, 'Blasphemy!

If the connection you want to DDOS (some ISDN modem..) is small, it\'s way more easy to DDOS than a 1GB fat pipe.\n\nTo DDOS Bitcoin all the attacker needs to do is fill 1MB of txn and pay more fee than the avg. txn in mempool.

The independent validation also ensures that miners who act honestly get their blocks incorporated in the blockchain, thus earning the reward. Those miners who act dishonestly have their blocks rejected and not only lose the reward, but also waste the effort expended to find a proof-of-work solution, thus incurring the cost of electricity without compensation.\nWhen a node receives a new block, it will validate the block by checking it against a long list of criteria that must all be met; otherwise, the block is rejected.

There is no "charity" and no commons here. Running a node gives a Bitcoin-related service the individual benefit of faster and safer verification.

For CoinSimple, a wallet can be\n\n1. a BIP32 wallet (currently Electrum 2.0, Trezor)\n2. a multisig BIP32 wallet (currently Electrum 2.0)\n3. a deterministic (but not HD) wallet (currently Armory or Electrum 1.9.8)\n4. a non-deterministic wallet (any bitcoin address) including those of any exchange\n5. a bitcoin exchange through its API (currently MeXBT)\n6. a bitcoin payment processor (currently BitPay, Coinbase, GoCoin)\n\n**I will mention a few features that CoinSimple offers in addition to the great offering of Mycelium Gear**. CoinSimple allows merchants to\n\n1. create invoices on the web and send them via email.\n2. choose the wallet they want to use on an invoice-basis. For example, Trezor for one invoice, and Electrum 2.0 for another.\n3. choose the price source they want to an invoice-basis. For example, Bitcoin Average for one invoice and Bitstamp for another.\n4. choose one of 193 national currencies to price their invoices\n5. create recurring invoices that are sent via email through CoinSimple\n6. create payment links that can be included in emails, social media, instant messages\n7. receive email notifications when their customer paid\n8. through the Android app (currently in beta, to be released on May 12), it allows merchants to have untrusted employees generate invoices on their behalf\n9. integrates with WooCommerce and Wordpress eCommerce\n10. have analytics data about their products and customers\n11. through integration with Shapeshift, accept any cryptocurrency but receive bitcoin (currently in beta, to be released on May 12)\n12. convert to fiat currency through integrations with BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin\n\nI hope I answered your question, and I will make sure I have a detailed writeup about the differences soon.

First of all, let me assure everyone that from our perspective this scenario **does not represent any error or problem with the RushWallet platform**.  Nonetheless, it\'s worth understanding what went on.  Here are the details:\n\n1)  First, *fortisle* publicly posted two secret RushWallet URL\'s to Reddit in [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/35e9af/i_think_i_got_a_refund_from_rakuten_on_one_of/).  Regardless of the reasons for doing so, the URL *is* the wallet as far as the RushWallet platform is concerned.  The user posted their secret wallet to Reddit.\n\n2)  Second, user *majorpaynei86* read the post and modified the secret url to remove the password portion beginning with "!".  (Some users here are confused:  the password portion does not encrypt the portion before it.  A password can be added to any valid RushWallet and it will "extend" the secret URL to make a completely different secret URL with a different address.  With or without the password, you get a valid RushWallet.  The password just *changes* which valid RushWallet you get)\n\n3)  The second URL so constructed allowed access to a RushWallet containing ~ .06 BTC\n\n4)  As reported [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/35fovm/so_apparently_i_just_stole_someones_bitcoin_from/cr43g0m) user *fortisle* turned out to be the owner of this second wallet as well.  Because the user who posted the link is the user whose funds were found by *majorpaynei86*, we are confident that this is NOT an example of a "wallet collision" as some had feared.\n\nSo what did happen?  Somehow this user created *two* separate wallets, one password protected and one not, that accessed two different RushWallets with different bitcoin addresses and different funds, but using the same secret URL (differing only in the password).  This is not something RushWallet will do by itself without some sort of intervention.  When they posted their secret wallet URL to Reddit, *majorpaynei86* was able to access a different wallet than the user expected, and remove the funds there.  I strongly suspect that *majorpaynei86* is a good samaritan who will be happy to return those funds as soon as *fortisle* can prove ownership of the account (for example by demonstrating ownership of the addresses which had sent funds there in the first place).\n\nAnd how did those two wallets, one with a password and one without, end up getting created in the first place?  We believe that at least part of the answer is suggested by an odd characteristic of the secret URL originally posted.  Attentive users will note that this url contains a section "?z=8449089".  This element, contained both in the original post and in the modified version accessed by *majorpaynei86*, is very unusual because RushWallet does not work by using these types of server arguments, which are completely ignored by the RushWallet code.  Only the portion after the "#", which is used locally and never sent to any server, is used to reconstruct the wallet.  This means, for example, that the wallet accessed by *majorpaynei86* would normally be accessed via the secret URL https://rushwallet.com/#AXy7dflmt16jzwCYbTeut4kCvqoRk0 which is treated identically by the RushWallet code and accesses the same wallet with the same address.\n\nIn our opinion, the added portion in the url means that something other than RushWallet itself modified this secret URL sometime between when it was created and when the two links were posted to Reddit.  For example, some URLs may have been mixed up during (repeated) copy and pasting of the URLs.  It would be very easy to paste only part of a password protected RushWallet, thereby creating a brand new wallet without the password, and then to begin using that new wallet.  Or it may be a consequence of the bookmarking system used.  Or it may have been modified by a browser extension or by malware on the user\'s computer.  In any case, we do not believe that RushWallet itself randomly created two different colliding URL\'s.  Perhaps if this user is willing to tell us more about the exact processes and software tools they used we can figure out the specifics.  But the fact that a completely non-RushWallet-style element has ended up included in this URL would be too much of a coincidence if only RushWallet itself had been responsible for creating the secret URL in the first place on two completely separate occasions.\n\nThanks for everyone who took the time to post details and help us look into this.  To anyone who is reading this, please do take the reminder that secret RushWallet URL\'s should *never* be posted to Reddit unless you are willing to have your bitcoins taken by someone a lot less nice than *majorpaynei86*.  Your RushWallet secret URL *is* the wallet.  Don\'t post your wallet on Reddit.  And thank you all for using RushWallet!  We welcome any and all suggestions on how we can continue to improve our product(s).\n\nSincerely,\nJeff Coleman\nCTO': 27, 'No but a title that admits that he stole does make him a thief.

That the effect of speculators is much more profound than fundamentals at this point. Meaning the price is far from stable and no one but no one knows what the true value of Bitcoin will be a month from now, let alone a year from now, let alone once it has "stabilized". Is $240 cheap or expensive? It\'s anyone\'s guess. \n\nIn that vein, Bitcoin attracts extremists. On one hand you\'ll hear that bitcoin is useless/a pyramid scam/whatever else, and it\'s price is eventually heading to zero. On the other you\'ll hear people say that fiat currencies are flawed, Bitcoin is the only answer, and one day a single Bitcoin will be worth astronomical amounts. Best to filter out both types, I think.  Absent a fundamental flW, Bitcoin will never go to zero so long as there is one other person willing to offer you something for it. And the likelihood of the dollar, euro, renminbi /yuan all imploding is likely pretty close to zero as well. \n\nLastly, SECURE your bitcoins!! Keeping them in an offline computer is best, but if that\'s not feasible, do your best to secure the computer you keep them on, or that you use for generating offline/cold storage addresses.

Rich people tend to spend money more on financial assets (shares) and houses than the rest of society. As a result, the prices of financial assets and houses goes up faster than other goods/services. \n\nSince the rich disproportionally own houses and financial assets, they benefit from the increase in prices of these assets, causing them to become richer over time relative to the rest of the population.\n\nWith bitcoin, money creation works in a completely different way and eventually will stop entirely.

Those are built, utilize utilities, add value to the surrounding land and generate tax revenue for the municipality.  \n\n> As a result, the prices of financial assets and houses goes up faster than other goods/services.\n\nYou've got it backwards.  Those things go up faster because people are seeking to get rid of their inflating dollars.  This is by design, so people use their money for productive things (like shares in a company that produces value) or real estate (that provides shelter and generally increases land value).\n\n> Since the rich disproportionally own houses and financial assets, they benefit from the increase in prices of these assets, causing them to become richer over time relative to the rest of the population.\n\nYou aren't prevented from buying those assets *too*.\n\n> With bitcoin, money creation works in a completely different way and eventually will stop entirely. Therefore, although bitcoin may start with a lot of inequality, it is not likely to get worse over time as it does with fiat.\n\nAnd how does that stop them from spending more money on selected commodities?
