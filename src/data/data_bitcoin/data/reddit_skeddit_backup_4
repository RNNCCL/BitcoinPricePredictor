I wonder how much respect you think you command in the real world versus what you actually have.\n\nI\'ll tell you what "going over well with people" means. It\'s about respect, human compassion, motivation to collaborate with others to help improve the world. Sure, youre trying to "improve" cryptos and help promote Bitcoin, but clearly your part in that broader agenda is to take down the competition (and fail at doing so might I add).\n\nI\'m not really sure if I\'ve ever seen Gavin, Vitalik, Satoshi, Andreas, or ANY of the highly respected people in cryptoland ever shit on the competition as hard as you have.

It is desirable that Bitcoin be *able* to compete with, say, Litecoin. Litecoin should not have a say in Bitcoin\'s operations, and vice versa.\n\nHowever, complexity requires interaction of many pieces. Bitcoin has many conceptual pieces (miners, users, software rules). In general, the rules rely on each other -- in some cases, if a single rule (check for double spends) were removed, all of the other rules would be useless. Moreover, rules can contradict each other. In this way, the "addition" of new rules can "remove" old rules.\n\nSo, since sidechains / "smart contracts" are an expansion of Bitcoin\'s rules, Bitcoin needs to have a say in these rules if it is to increase (or even retain) its usefulness.\n\nIn short, the "private owners"/administrators of Bitcoin would be more generally effective if they could "own"/control all of Bitcoin\'s sidechains as well. However, this "teamwork principle" does not change the principle of competition -- The owners of Litecoin should *also* have control/ownership over *their* Litecoin-sidechains.\n\nTo use your metaphor: Uber should be able to fire unwanted employees, and Taxi Companies should be able to fire *their* unwanted employees.

One thing which separates Drivechain from alternative proposals, is that the *Bitcoin* miners can steal from alternate sidechains (previously, if a sidechain were mined using sha3, then the sha3 miners would be the potential thieves -- Bitcoin miners could not steal without creating consensus problems). So my proposal is that "only Discussed Sidechains join the BTC network". By default everything is rejected. My ["fork futures"](http://www.truthcoin.info/blog/win-win-blocksize/) idea could help, in cases where the net benefits of a sidechain are not obvious. (But, I would suspect that they would be generally obvious, similar to the soft fork case).\n\n> And the reason that we need some smart-contracts to be blocked is that, among other scenarios, a "Reputation Free-Rider Problem" (one oracle simply copying a high-reputation oracle\'s output) is inevitable.

A lay person like yourself (or myself) who does not spend all day working on the protocol and thinking about the tradeoffs inherent to making any decision is not well-versed enough to know what constitutes a conservatively-larger block.\n\nBtw, keep in mind that SegWit is akin to about a "1.75 MB" block size increase (and yes yes, wallets must also update for the user to see the benefit, but most wallets are already on board, and the remaining holdouts are large centralized wallets for whom migration is technically trivial).

You might argue that block size is not unlimited but for sidechains it might as well be since they will likely not likely be filling blocks. Also even with bitcoin, blocks being full is rare, and has bad consequences long term.\n\n> For security, sidechains can be merge-mined.\n\nYes, but now sidechains are limited to bitcoin style mining.

In the case of the sidechain they would need to raise their transaction fees enough to secure their networks because they don't have the subsidy, and based upon that thread, a strategy to do that would be to have an even smaller tx limit than the main blockchain to force users to compete for space in a block.\n\nThat is actually a really good thread, it is really enlightening. Thanks for sharing it!\n": 1, "That's not right. I don't know how to explain in the little time I have to reddit right now, but [here](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6284.0) is a bitcointalk thread.

And there are other uses of such hashing power, one of which is also to attack the network. So yeah, hashing power is diverted, difficulty adjusts but then that means it takes less power to attack the network. This is the cost of security, enough hashing power to prevent a 51% attack. Basically bitcoin mining has to pay enough to attract at least 50% of the *effective* hashing power of the entire world. You might also assume new asics no longer need to be developed, but that is also wrong, because a new asic concentrates more power into fewer hands (just as it is doing today!), and if bitcoin doesn't pay enough to cover the cost of proliferating power of new asics then it could also be used against bitcoin.\n\nYou can also consider a case of having an altcoin that uses the same hashing algorithm but subsidizes mining better. In such a scenario miners could switch to the new coin, which if both coins don't split hashing power, who ever has less power is less secure. If one coin pays less than the other (regardless of subsidy) they will effectively lose hashing power to the other.\n\nAlso in simpler terms its an arms race that must be paid for!": 1, "> Yes right now since the cost of mining isn't paid for via tx fee. But what is going to pay for mining when mining returns nothing? Miners are not going to do it for free.\n\nMy economics are correct. You are forgetting that the difficulty of mining adjusts. Rethink your analysis with this in mind.\n\n> So what you are saying then is that bitcoin would just become insecure, that they would not try to raise the tx fee to cover mining costs to improve network security? Is that really what you think would happen?\n\nMining costs fall to the level that ensures an average rate of 6 per hour. If miners can't cover mining costs (fees rise in the short term), and the difficulty adjusts. In the end, miners will include transactions at any cost > than the marginal cost of including a tx in a block, which is a technological cost and is very minor.": 1, "Yes, though it's related to your original discussion. I think you made a mistake in your reasoning, which is why I challenged you on the economics.\n\n>  In the case of the sidechain they would need to raise their transaction fees enough to secure their networks because they don't have the subsidy\n\nI disagree with the causation here. The subsidy doesn't reduce fees--all it does is change the equilibrium difficulty. The author of that thread, by arguing that with an infinite blocksize the equilibrium transaction fees will be very low (and the difficulty will continually fall), implies that the subsidy does *not* subsidize fees--it subsidizes network security by raising the difficulty. Transaction fees are *independent* of this. Just imagine that you're a miner: you will include any transaction as long as it has enough fee to compensate you for increased orphan risk and the few cpu cycles it takes to do ECDSA (of course, in practice verifying the signature needs to be done only once for each mining pool). The costly part of mining is hashing the block header a trillion times.\n\n> But our original discussion was whether the subsidy gives the main blockchain an advantage over sidechains, and that seems to me to still be the case.\n\nYes, this was your original point. It depends upon the previous quote of yours.": 1, '> Okay if that were true, what would happen if blocksize were unlimited and all coins mined and really low tx fees?\n\nIt is true. If blocks were unlimited, the price for a tx would be equal to the marginal cost of including an extra tx in a block: fractions of a penny. The network would likely not be secure because you also stipulate that all the bitcoins are mined.\n\nAm I missing your point?\n\n> I mean, you can, but like I said transaction fees are not subsidized\n\nTransactions fees were never subsidized.': 2, "> If blocks were unlimited, the price for a tx would be equal to the marginal cost of including an extra tx in a block: fractions of a penny.\n\nYes **right now** since the **cost of mining** isn't paid for via tx fee. But what is going to pay for mining when mining returns nothing? Miners are not going to do it for free.\n\n> The network would likely not be secure because you also stipulate that all the bitcoins are mined.\n\nYes but even before all bitcoins are mined, mining will produce almost nothing in bitcoins. After all there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins mined.\n\nSo what you are saying then is that bitcoin would just become insecure, that they would not try to raise the tx fee to cover mining costs to improve network security? Is that really what you think would happen?\n\nAgain, a transaction fee is not necessarily just used to pay to get your transaction into the blockchain.

I don't know if that is opportunity cost or cost of risk of using the exchange - but either way the leverage buyers are borrowing at that rate so also value money that highly.

So the video #3 did not come to me as a surprise at all but perfectly confirmed my current understanding. However, if universities teach this money multiplier model as the ultimate truth (rather than a simplifying model) to their finance & economics students without going a step further explaining the actual mechanisms, then this would be really disturbing. (I studied a technical subject, so I cannot tell from personal experience)': 1, '>Absent a government defined reserve requirement, banks will self impose one consistent with their tolerance for risk.\n\nWhich can be a lot riskier than a reasonable minded person might find to be prudent.\n\nParticularly when these institutions are aware that they can be bailed out at the end of the day.': 1, 'There was a run on the Fed in the 70s and it defaulted. ': 0, 'Apparently you understand and describe the mechanisms correctly.\n\nHowever, I would use a different terminology when it comes to money and money creation, to avoid misunderstandings and add clarity:\n\nInstead of saying "The private banks don\'t create money", I would introduce two distinct terms "Central bank money" and "Debt money" (both of which unfortunately carry the same unit of account [e.g. "EUR"] which doesn\'t help reducing confusion).\n\nThen the correct phrasing is: Private banks don\'t create central bank money, but they very well do create debt money!\n\nWithout this distinction we have these unnecessary arguments on whether or not private banks create "money", and both sides are right but mean different things when saying "money".\n\nClearly, in most routine situations in daily life we all treat both kinds of money interchangeably; e.g. I don\'t care whether you give me 10 EUR in cash (central bank money) or via SEPA bank transfer (debt money). This justifies summarizing both C- and D-money under the overall term "money", and the statement "private banks create money" is correct. On the other hand, from strict money theoretical point of view, it is justified to only call C-money really "money", and the statement "private banks don\'t create money" is correct.\n\nHence we should stop using the term "money" altogether when debating whether or not private banks "create money", to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nInstead, we should use a more precise language with clearly defined terminology when discussing topics as delicate as this.\n\n': 1, 'Last sentence of the video:\n\n> "Believe it or not, commercial banks actually create more money than central banks."\n\nThis is not untrue, but very misleading in that it omits mentioning the crucial distinction that we are talking here about two **different kinds of money** (both of which are unluckily commonly referred to by the same word, namely "money", and use the same currency unit (e.g. "EUR"), and are hence wrongly set "equal" in layman\'s perception):\n\n* on the one hand, "central bank money" (=legal tender).\n\n* on the other hand, "debt money" or "commercial banks\' IOUs for central bank money" (not legal tender).\n\nThe distinction between these two moneys vanishes in daily practice, because we use them completely interchangeably in our daily lives, and the existence of ATMs gives the false impression of full equivalence between these kinds of moneys.\n\nOnly in the rare events of bank runs or bank crisis/bank bankruptcies people get (sometimes!) reminded that they are not the same.\n\nI say "sometimes", because usually people still fall for the misconceptions of equivalence between these moneys, because upon these events (like in Cyprus) people usually say that the commercial banks have "stolen" their money. But this is factually incorrect. The truth is even worse and beyond laymen\'s comprehension: The banks *never owned* that money in the first place (by definition of how the banking money system works!)! They only made a *promise* to pay that money back upon request and now defaulted (=admitted they cannot keep that promise).\n\nPeople would comprehend all this much better if not the same term ("money", "EUR") was used for both kinds of money. To understand the money system, people should think of two distinct "commodities" as follows (taking here EUROs for the sake of example):\n\n* Commodity A = **C**entral bank money or **C**ash or "**C-EUR**".\n\n* Commodity B = **D**ebt money or private banks\' IOUs or "**D-EUR**" (more precisely, every single private bank (a, b, c, ...) issues its own "Da-EUR", "Db-EUR", "Dc-EUR", ...)\n\nIn usual commercial life, the exchange rate beween C-EUR and D-EUR is pretty much 1:1, which makes us forget in daily routine that these are different euros. The reason for an 1:1 exchange rate can be justified in that the disadvantage of the D-EUR just being IOUs for "real" C-EURos are offset by the much higher *convenience* of handling electronic D-EURos. However, there are some situations where the exchange rate is not 1:1:\n\nSome merchants value D-EUR higher than C-EUR because of its convenience.\n\nAt certain times of banking crisis, the C-EUR is valued (much) higher than the Dx-EUR of certain banks "x".\n\n**TL;DR:**  Remember that money is not same as money and EUR (or any other fiat) does not equal EUR. Instead always remember that there is the C-EUR and the Dx-EUR (of priv. bank "x"), these are different things and just TREATED equal for convenience with 1:1 exchange rate, and all referred to as "EUR" for simplicity.\n': 5, "Please watch video #1 of this series of six didactically worthy videos:\n\nBANKING 101: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyl80QTKi0gPBcb32paMvXxcq7UUeJskV\n\nYou'll see that the notion that banks only lend out other people's money withou creating new (credit/debt-) money is a misconception.\n\nYou'll see a better model in video #2 and the full mechanisms of how it works today in videos #3 ff.": 3, 'I watched this whole thing and came away unimpressed. The whole thing sounded like an "I\'m smarter than everyone else because I know X", when in reality he\'s mostly wrong. \n\n> There\'s no natural limit to how big the money supply can grow. \n\nMostly false. If banks lend out to the maximum and keep the minimum required reserves... that\'s the maximum the money supply can grow to. It\'s true the fed can increase reserves and subsequently increase bank lending, but that implies the decider of the size of the money supply is the central bank, not the commercial banks. The opposite of what the video suggests. \n\nYou could say, "Well some types of accounts don\'t have reserve requirements". Yes, but that doesn\'t mean a bank can engage in infinite lending. They would go bust if they tried it. Absent a government defined reserve requirement, banks will self impose one consistent with their tolerance for risk.\n\n> The total amount of money depends on the confidence of banks. \n\nAgain, no. From the entire history of modern banking until 2008, banks lent out all of their excess reserves (excess the government imposed reserve requirement). Look at the Fred chart.. https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/EXCSRESNS\n\nExcess reserves were flat lined at zero until 2008. That implies that the money supply was totally controlled by central banks, not commercial banks. And that makes sense, why would you hold cash and take a negative ROI if you don\'t have to? In 2008 there was a massive policy change which accounts for the deviation from the norm. \n\nYou only can say "Total money depends on the confidence of banks", if you look at 2008 and after... again after a massive policy change to shift incentives. \n\nAnyways I tend to think the entire operation of the banking and monetary system is screwed up and functions nothing like it would in a genuine free market.  ': 2, 'Nice video, but I don\'t really know if this is the best way to picture the situation.\n\nAlso, there should be explanation how also a "bank run" can happen, if too many people withdraw their cash from the bank simultaneously.

No!\n\nYes it is! No central bank money is created, sure, but debt money is! See below.\n\n> That money exists and was deposited to the bank. It\'s the depositor which made the deposit on demand and thinks and acts as if his bank is only safekeeping his deposit that has the appearance of money creation. If the system was upfront with their depositors how it really works.. that their deposits on demand are in majority actually being lent as investments, depositors would know their bank doesn\'t actually safekeep all of their money and may not be able to repay at some point.\n\nI recommend you to watch this series of 6 videos - at least the first 3: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyl80QTKi0gPBcb32paMvXxcq7UUeJskV\n\nThen you\'ll see that the notion that banks just lend out their depositors\' money to others is a misconception, as already explained in video #1. Your view of how the money system works seems to coincide with the 2/3rd of population in video #1.\n\nThe money multiplier model as discussed in OP\'s linked video and in video #2 of my linked video series, gives a much better impression of what really happens. This is a decisive step forward to understand because it teaches you that private banks really do create new (debt-!)money!\n\nVideo #3 expands more on this and explains that the "money multiplier" model is more a historical derivation but today\'s banking system works very different and does not even need the multiple steps of lending and physical cash withdrawal to create new debt money in large quantifies.\n\n>Money creation happens only at the central bank.\n\nVery true if you talk about "central bank money" (= cash + private banks\' electronic deposits at the central bank). Very untrue if you talk about debt or credit money, which is, as a matter of fact, naturally being created by private banks.': 1, "Its actually wrong.

Historical blocks are needed by all full nodes doing the initial sync, even if they enable pruning, and also by all Bitcoin network nodes (even lightweight nodes) that are catching up after being offline for a while. It's planned to improve this in the future by letting pruned nodes store a random range of x MB of historical blocks, and signalling to lightweight nodes that you keep the most recent y MB of the most recent blocks, but currently, pruned nodes will not perform these functions at all. They will still relay transactions and blocks, and if you use Bitcoin Core for your own real transactions, you will contribute to Bitcoin's [economic security](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node#Economic_strength).\n\nIf you're thinking of enabling pruning, you might consider backing up your `blocks` and `chainstate` directories to one of your external drives beforehand so that you can move back to non-pruned mode more easily in case you want to do a rescan or whatever in the future.\n\nThere's more info about full nodes here: https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Full_node": 4, 'If you are new and just want to use Bitcoin there is no need to download the blockchain.
