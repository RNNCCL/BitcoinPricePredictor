Power will shift to networks and coalitions in a multipolar world.\n\n.\n\n> *Nonstate World*: Driven by new technologies, nonstate actors take the lead in confronting global challenges.\n\n.\n\n> At the same time, the role of governments versus the importance of non-state actors also becomes important. Under this trend, networks and coalitions are important in balancing the resulting multipolar world. Countries with the highest GDP and population size will also have to work with the networks and interest groups, and will not be able to simply use their weight to gain power. Geopolitical uncertainty will increase with this trend.\n\n.\n\n> In yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s world, wealth and the wealthy were mostly tied to the nation state. Countries were more easily able to raise progressive taxes on the wealthy to support social programs. However, in today\xe2\x80\x99s world, wealth is more easily transferable. France\xe2\x80\x99s follies with its 75% tax rate and the flight of its wealthy to more favorable tax venues is a good example of the differences between today\xe2\x80\x99s situation and earlier conditions. Thus, not only is there a chance of a growing non-state technological proletariat; there is also evidence of a stateless wealthy class as well.\n>\n> In this environment, long-term investors will spend much of their time trying to protect their wealth from confiscatory tax regimes and hackers.

When you mine a block you mine it complete with the transactions that it contains.\n\n\nPart of the 'game theory' behind mining is making sure that it is worth while for miners to include transactions in blocks at all.  There are some circumstances where you can make it so that it is to the advantage of the miner to mine only 1 transaction blocks by making them very expensive in CPU time to validate (and therefore propagate).\n\n\nObviously that is something to avoid so it is very important not to make it advantageous for them.": 1, "It is actually fairly simple.\n\n\nWhen a block is found and transmitted there is a period of time as it propagates across the network being validated.\n\n\nDuring that time miners will often stop mining the previous block and start mining on the headers of the block that is propagating.  Because they don't have the full information on the block they cant be sure that transactions they have are included in that propagating block or not.  So if they include any transactions and that were in the propagating block any block they mine will be invalid.\n\n\nSo, they mine on empty blocks until they can be 100% sure of the sate of the network.

That's part of why there's no auto-update mechanism. Also, at least the current major version *and* the last major version are supported. So for example when the CLTV softfork was rolled out, there was both a 0.11.2 release and a 0.10.4 release, since 0.10 is still supported.

This might regress to "just multisig" a little too much, don\'t you think? After all, one can really change the federated signers of the DAO, once they are set up.

Just reuse of the signers?': 1, 'Why do we need Ethereum when we have Rootstock?': 7, "You misunderstand what I am suggesting. \n\nAs I understand it, EC has an additive property which means we can extend multisig from m-of-n to m(x-of-x)-of-n. The peg itself should exist out of miltiple such multisig addresses with old or compromised ones being retired. No forks are required for this to work at all. \n\nThe DAO would be the new coin issuance mechanism of the side chain. It can run a full/lite Bitcoin node and confirm incoming TX and create tokens on the side chain. It can issue an exit TX which the key holders can then sign. \n\nSignature violations can be submitted to the DAO which causes it to issue a TX to move funds from a compromised address to an new one. The values of addresses (x,m,n) should be set up so that the remaining signatories can with a high probability still move funds to a new exit address. \n\nRegarding who watches the watchmen. The TX mechanism above can be used to alert when people are signing things the DAO software didn't issue. The watchmen can earn fees in the side chain (incentivising them not to harm it) and upon successful exit. They can also be bonded in earlier Bitcoin entry/exit addresses and on the sidechain. \n\nAs a measure of last resort the DAO could cause the sidechain fees to increase if a entry/exit pocket was successfully attacked and tokens no longer match exactly. The fees would be burned until parity is reached again. If the rest of the scheme is properly configured, this might never happen, but Bitcoin side risk should be sized so that this scenario is insignificant anyway.\n\nAbsolutely no forks are required for this in Bitcoin. The most generic way to do it would be to have a sidechain template that has some form of OP_EXIT functionality and OP_ENTER functionality that can be additively signed by a large group of participants. Then DAO software could be written that manages the appointment of signatories and is gets configured to interact with a sidechain. So Bitcoin DAO, Gear DAO, Sidechain DAO.

Parallel processing is not allowed.\n\n(2b) The original  Ethereum model of having every node execute every smart contract doesn't scale - that's why the community is looking at sharding, off-chain computations, etc. (which begs the question, is it still a decentralized smart contract system/blockchain?)": 1, "Well bonding would be one major reason as would limiting damage of attempted exit scams. If new addresses were required to bond their entire maximum balance into the set of currently active addresses, they wouldn't benefit from an exit scam since they can only pull it for their own limited fund. The other addresses could then honour user withdrawals from the bonded funds. \n\nThe signers would earn fees upon exit in Bitcoin and side token fees upon entry into the side chain, which is why they would be willing to bond because it's darn difficult to earn BTC denominated interest at low risk.

I\'m just talking, please don\'t take use of "disingenuous" to be offensive personally, I\'m describing an argument not a person.\n\nI used the word "disingenous" for two reasons:\n\n - It\'s perfectly clear there can be adverts for Bitcoin.  It doesn\'t need to be a company or a product for that to be so.  There were, for example, adverts advising people about avoiding bird flu, when that was all the rage.  Bird flu isn\'t a product or a company.  That doesn\'t mean those adverts had no copyright.\n\n - Bitcoin is _manifestly_ a competitor to PayPal.  In fact, if it weren\'t then why would this even be a parody?  Swapping a BMW for a lasagne is a reasonable "they aren\'t competitors" statement; but the fact that the Bitcoin community is so keen on jumping on a PayPal advert, is so keen on PayPal\'s stance towards Bitcoin tells you that these are not completely unrelated technologies.\n\nBoth of these are pretty apparent, and so I think it is "not ingenuous" to pretend that they aren\'t so. \n\n> Saying bitcoin is a competitor to paypal is like saying the dollar is a competitor to paypal.\n\nAgain I say "disinegenous".  You are surely aware that Bitcoin is not just a one-for-one analogy of a dollar?  Dollars, Euros, Pounds, Rubles, Shillings, whatever, are indeed all currencies.  Bitcoin is (we hope) a currency.  But "Bitcoin" isn\'t just the unit of account on the blockchain, it\'s the Bitcoin network, it\'s the blockchain _itself_.  You can\'t just pretend those other facilities exist.  PayPal can be used to transfer value from person to person on the Internet.  Bitcoin can be used to transfer value from person to person on the Internet.  They are competitors.\n\n> Ford comes along and makes an advertisement that their new car is so special it\'s like having a new means of transportation.\n\nWhy would that be unreasonable?

No one did the "parody" thing until this particular commercial and for the particular reason that paypal is claiming to be "new money". In an environment in which we actually have some "new money", that now seems a bit silly.\n\nEdit:\n\nSilly, and worthy of making fun of, in a sort of social commentary sort of way. \n\nBasically, Paypal is nothing more than a victim of the times. They are selling horse carriages in the new age of the automobile. Some folks pointed that out and they, in traditional big corp fashion, are going to suppress that idea as long as possible. Shareholders and all...\n\nEdit2 (sorry..at work): I should point out there is probably some additional motivation b/c of the particular role money plays in our society (vs transportation). Many people think conventional monetary systems are pretty bad for society and feel strongly so,  so it\'s not too much a surprise that a company seen to be part of the "established money" and which appears to be attempting to take advantage of the *idea* of bitcoin is parodied directly in the context of the same advertising campaign in which they are attempting to benefit from the idea of "digital money" which they did not actually contribute to creating.\n\nRemember, before today Paypal was just a payment service thing for online payments.

The size of the hash power (what I would think of as small and big) plays little role in the game, right?\n\nA soft-fork can replace a soft fork;  it depends upon what it is in the soft fork you are reversing, and how you deal with history.   For example, if the hard limit was up at 8 MB, and we deployed a soft fork for miners that they would not build on any block bigger than 2 MB, and everyone else doesn\'t care, then as long as most miners respect the limit, the 2 MB would be enforced.   Certainly someone could "attack" and build a 3 MB block, and the network would accept it, but as miners build on some other fork, the 3 MB block would be orphaned, and the hash power used to build it forfeited.  Any subsequent soft fork at any size below the hard limit would just work.\n\nI personally see no purpose to the hard limit for blocksize.  Most code can trust the miners on this issue, as they have everything to gain by following a soft limit, and everything to lose by ignoring it.   Even if a group has more than 50% of the mining power, they do not control the value of the token.  And it is that value that makes mining worth doing.   So they, more than any group including Bitcoin Core Developers, have more at stake to follow the rules.\n\nThis message, that the miners want very much to follow the rules, was provided loudly and clearly and repeatedly from the miners at the Scaling Bitcoin Conference in Hong Kong.  As well as a call to raise the blocksize to at least 2 MB to get us another year without changes to the economics of the protocol.

If not on the blockchain, through some secure mechanism (like LN).\n\nI\'d also include protecting the value of the token.  It is why miners mine, and if the value of the token goes away, then all other security that comes from mining and the diversity of supporters goes away.\n\nThe construction of alternatives like The Lightning Network requires a low barrier to entry.  The larger the fee, the more expensive to set up and tear down channels, and thus more risky for both parties.  The calculus of this risk depends on the value of the network, which starts out at near zero, and grows with adoption.   I worry that a premature fee market is a danger to alternatives.\n\nI also see the development of a fee market this year rather than a couple years down the road as a large risk.

The general convention in English is that terminology becomes *more* useful if applied outside of its original context.\n\nThat said, if the Bitcoin community *were* in some bizarre position where we had to select a fork date without communication, I imagine that reasoning would probably go something like:\n\n* early dates are too costly, so we wouldn't do it immediately\n* exactly how far out would we do it?  once you get far enough out many dates are roughly equivalent in cost.  But switching at different times from each other involves enormous costs, so we have to try and coordinate somehow.\n* hey, the block halving date is coming up.

That is the scope of the protocol.  That is where its value as an investment, or currency, stems from.  Abstracting money away from state should make the development of both better.  If Bitcoin no longer has the above properties, and some other token does, then either a filter exists (probably in the form of political subdivision) that makes no such token possible, or that token will become more valuable than bitcoin in the long run.\n\nAppealing to existing users is practical, but not if it is at the cost of the original values that created the space in the first place.  The comparison of block size increase to socialism is, I feel, apt.  It's asymmetric.  Trying to solve the N * N problem of Bitcoin while maintaining the above properties is difficult, but not an endorsement of scaling down validators and relying on them to maintain the original value proposition.

Introduction\n\n**Commerce on the Internet** has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and **cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,** and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for non-reversible services. With the possibility of reversal, the need for trust spreads. Merchants must be wary of their customers, hassling them for more information than they would otherwise need. A certain percentage of fraud is accepted as unavoidable. **These costs and payment uncertainties can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments over a communications channel without a trusted party.**\n\n\n\n>You're talking to someone who has invested thousands of dollars and who would not 'sell' a bitcoin for his cat.
