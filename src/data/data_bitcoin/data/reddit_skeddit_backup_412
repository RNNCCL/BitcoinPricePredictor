Moreover all of us have at least 5 years of development experience including finacial software.  \nOf course initially we planned to complete it in 2-3 months but as it usually is with estimations for software project, to get realistic estimations you have to multiply it with Tambov constant :)\n\nBefore I'll break down to you what kind of components need to be there let me say that we have all functionality that localbitcoins has plus some extra functionality (biggest is system wide private messaging for users). Also our UI and UX approach is completely different and tailored for mainstream and first time bitcoin buyers.\n\nHere is what needs to be done\n\n* Bitcoin web wallet. Important parts are: generate bitcoin addresses for users, send out payments, receive payments and confirm transaction after `n` confirmations. All at the same time properly handle users balances.\n\n* Create offers/ads. When you have basic flow of users bitcoin wallets in hand, it's time to move into marketplace part. First part is the offer creation. What are the rules here like hard-coded payment methods (we went step further and allow users to dynamically create new payment methods), payment window time, BTC price margin, offer visiblity to users? etc etc... Additionally have all the CRUD (create,read,update,delete) operations for the offer and all the business logic like updating price every 10 minutes, activation, deactivation etc...\n\n* Now comes the trading part - start trade, mark trade as paid, complete trade, auto-cancel trade, cancel trade by user, dispute trade, leave feedback. For all these trade actions the business logic has to be extremely well thought through and code written well with all edge cases taken into account. Otherwise you can end up with adding balance twice, deleting accidently records or simply break database schema.\n\n* Trade live chat - Not a small part, considering that you need file upload here, moderator messages in case of dispute and anything else you see there.\n\n* Feedback system is another part. Would you make it different? How complex would that be then? We have different feedback approach - feedback can be left for every completed trade and also a reply can be left. In case dispute a loser can't leave feedback.\n\n* Reporting capabilities for any historical data/actions - users completed trades, activity ledger, transactions ledger, generated bitcoin addresses and any other historical data you need to output.\n\n* Backend admin for website health - bitcoin balance in bitcoin cores, users balances, active trades, history, anything you can think of you want to see in real time.\n\nAll these above points are only specifically about bitcoin peer to peer marketplace. I'm not mentioning anything about proper enterprise software plus secure website development - unit tests, replication, disaster recovery, build automation, backups, validations, protection against all kinds of website attacks and so on. And for last not least is knowing how to develop applications where you are dealing with financial data and user balances where knowing how to write transaction SQL queries is important so malicious users couldn't double spend for example with race conditions that has happened in multiple bitcoin exchanges :)  \nWe have very little bit of tips on our blog about it https://blog.paxful.com/7-security-tips-bitcoin-startups-must-not-ignore/\n\nIf you really want to develop long lasting similar project I recommend you to choose as your IT partner somebody who has done similar project before so they can estimate better and wouldn't make any rookie mistakes.\n\nI would say this project price is close to $100k.\nOne of our developers has software development company and may be interested to work if your project won't overlap with Paxful. If you would like a more exact pricing quote please go to his software dev company website www.kaizern.com": 3, "Thanks.

If bitcoin can provide a way to avoid the use of banks in these transactions, then that's a massive bug-fix of the whole system.\n\nHaving said that - I don't entirely understand how Bitcoin is to serve as a replacement here.  The need for the letter of credit (as I understand it) comes from the fact that when a trader buys some goods to sell overseas, they don't know for sure that they are going to be able to sell them all, and thus be able to pay their supplier.  Thus a bank provides a letter of credit to the trader, which is then given to the supplier in exchange for goods.  This letter of credit ensures that the supplier will get paid at a certain date - irrespective of the fate of the trader.  Thus the supplier feels confident about handing over their goods.\n\nIt also allows greater freedom to the trader who doesn't have to dump a load of capital into a bunch of goods that will be sitting in boxes on a ship for however long.  And this is important - if you are a big trader, you'll otherwise have millions of dollars of capital at any given time, just sitting in boxes, doing nothing.\n\nSo it's not just about the fact that the money exchange is happening cross border - it's that there is a specific need for the credit - as credit... \n\nHow exactly does Bitcoin fix THIS problem?": 10, 'The bank I use had instant and free messaging cash.

Millions of users will happily trust others to manage their security for them, and they will pay them to do it.\n\n>One day fully verifying nodes will become scarce enough, and in demand enough, that people will gladly pay to use them, and that will help drive the need for companies, organisations and entrepreneurs to deploy full nodes to cut costs of depending on other pay-to-use full nodes. Fully verifying nodes are not going to be a permanent presence in cell phones, 1mb or not. It's just not going to happen. The sooner people wake up to this fact and realise that the sky is not in fact going to cave in on them like chicken little continually rants on about, the sooner we can move on to more important things.\n\nThis constant paranoia that there won't be enough nodes or that node centralisation will doom Bitcoin is foolishness. Full node scarcity will be the fuel that will *ensure* more decentralisation of nodes as businesses/organisations realise that it's too costly to keep paying nodes to do all their verifying, and instead move the verifying in-house. SPVs will probably subscribe to multiple trusted nodes for 20cents/month, much like people do with VPNs, and it's very likely that will create lots of new full node competition and decentralisation in itself.": 7, "I feel it's very weird we have this digital coin and people are still scratching their heads about incentives\n\nUh charge people for free riding on a full node? \n\nMore full nodes shouldn't be an end into itself, more useful Bitcoin should be. If we only had 100 nodes but still had the full utility and reliability of Bitcoin, things would be better not worse\n\n": 7, ">Plus this model would incentivize sybil attacking the network with tens of thousands of cruddy proxies that go back to the same actual network nodes, in order to capture the most SPV payment\n\nThis only works if all the nodes are anonymous, throw in a Coinbase, Bitpay, Circle, Genimi, and several other exchange nodes that all have a vested interest in being honest, then Sybil attacks are pointless. The idea of running a full node which is pay-to-play is not to provide squillions of faceless yes men, it's to establish a reputation and sell that reputation to people that need your service. Businesses that need the security of a full node could very easily be making money with SPV users as well as using the node to verify their own transactions for any other services they are providing. \n\nWhen you go and buy a product and want the best price, do you go ask 10,000 merchants you've never dealt with, and choose the cheapest, or do you find stores with solid reputations that you've dealt with before and choose from them (as well as compare it to the other 10,000 faceless merchants)? I don't know about you but I'm willing to pay more for a product from Amazon, than pay 20% less from some rinkydink 90s era website that expects you to email the order to them for a quote. Reputations are valuable as they are built on a history of reliability. It's how the entire world works, we all put our trust in something at some stage. \n\nSPV wallets wouldn't be paying for the cheapest service, they're paying for a reputation, trust. And nodes will be willing to fight for that trust. Because SPV load is small it means that SPVs could hook into many more nodes to up their transaction security and trust thus avoiding centralisation. VPNs have similar problems and incentives when it comes to offering privacy, they have to do right by their users if they want to sell their service and it would be no different with pay-to-play full nodes.  Sure, you could use Tor (the 10,000 merchants), but even better is using Tor (10,000 merchants) plus a VPN (Circle, Coinbase, et al.).\n\n": -1, '"Master nodes" don\'t have to be network nodes at all.

This is essentially untrue, at least in the fundamentals. A miner has a transaction already before deciding to include it, or will have to immediately obtain it if someone else includes it.  Because the transactions have been already forwarded around, once a block is found all that must be communicated is which of the already relayed transactions were actually included. This is what the block-relay-network protocol does already, and it takes 2 bytes per already-relayed transaction. This can further be reduced by the use of schemes such as the "O(1)" block relay idea, which-- if miners adopt consistent priority/censorship policies-- need only send the difference between the expected block and the actual-- with data only proportional to the difference.\n\nNext, you\'re assuming that to whatever extent these proportional costs are non-negligible, miners will address them by optimizing their block size to maximize income.  However, there is a superior option:  Miners can prevent orphaning by centralizing the control of their hashpower to single large pools. We saw this effect after miners started producing blocks over 500K that orphaning drove miners to consolidate in large pools to reduce orphaning. Decreasing your own blocksize is not enough to reduce your orphaning, others must do so too, and larger miners would be on the winning side of the orphaning more often, reducing the size also has an unclear benefit,  delays transactions, and passes up fee income. Centralizing mining results in an all cause orphaning reduction, is simple, and can reduce other operating costs.  As a result we saw single parties having administrative control of over half the hashpower, completely undermining one of the base security assumptions of the system. This inspired the emergency deployment of the block relay protocol, which seems to have helped; though the distribution is still quite ugly. \n\nFinally, you\'re assuming that the equilibrium where fees match the costs related to verification and transmission is a viable state of affairs.  The level of POW security in the system is a totally free parameter, if most of the miners income is going to pay costs related to verification and bandwidth then those funds cannot be used to provide POW security.  Moreover, if the cost for verification at this equilibrium (if one exists at all, as miners can always increase their own income by breaking rank and accepting lower fees if there is no size limit) is considerable (E.g. comparable to the fee income) then how will any non-miners be able to afford to also run the verification, which is an essential part of Bitcoin\'s economic argument for SPV security-- that the majority of hashpower will follow the protocol because others will reject their blocks if they violate it).\n\nI agree with you that the situation long term looks unlike what it does not, but the situation even now is more complex than you may suspect.\n\nCheers,': 3, "I agree with /u/mmeijeri, the fee market stuff is bullshit.

Not sure where you got that information or vibe from in my first section of my comment below but I am sorry if I have annoyed you in anyway.\n\nAnyway, a very brief look at my years since I first heard about Bitcoin. I managed to take BBQcoin from a "Joke" coin and get it onto multiple exchanges and during that time I released and still develop for Extremecoin and recently was offered a programmer position in the Unotanium Development team and have been involved in Crypto-Currency since early 2011, when the diff of Bitcoin was 6 million and the diff of Litecoin was 1.\n\nI only mention that so that you have the understanding that I have not just read one White paper about block-chain formulation or read one article about Bitcoin in New Scientist.\n\nI have been involved on a daily basis from 2011 till 2013 while learning about effective trading with the original little core fan community Bitcoin and Litecoin had at the time and I have not looked back since.\n\nI have constantly been learning about new ways to utilise the Bitcoin network and P2P in general and I will never stop being fascinated by Bitcoin.\n\nAll I know is that my first and foremost skill set, is product marketing and understanding the general public; their wants and their needs.\n\nI didn\'t have to write that comment that I did just below this one but I did because I actually care about Bitcoin and sometimes when you are passionate about eventually us all having a Global Digital Cryptographic near instant payment system that also still stays true to its Open Source roots and strives for Global Equality. Its hard not to be excited about the future of every system the government\'s have, being either handed over the the P2People or as an example, the Emergency Services being privatised.\n\nIt was just an idea, that was all and it might even be a silly one but hey, you never know, maybe Bitcoin could openly devote itself to being a rare commodity, shifting focus onto extremely secure storage systems and Litecoin could be the Currency that is backed by it or any other even faster currency.\n\nOne thing that is a fact, Bitcoin cannot be a Currency and a Commodity (Totally different in everyway) so at some point, the development team might be forced to choose in which direction they want to go in with my hope and opinion being that they choose commodity.': 2, 'if nation-states tie their economies to bitcoin, censorship is now a self-imposed economic sanction.': 3, "I'm a keen supporter of Bitcoin, but I find the writer's assertion in the first paragraph of his introduction that Bitcoin is not a financial product or service, and his use of publishing metaphors rather than financial ones, rather disingenuous.\n\nBitcoin is certainly far more than merely a means of transferring value.

The 12 word pneumonic is just used to represent a large 256 bit number that is used to seed your HD wallet.  You could actually just create an Electrum wallet with your own randomly created 256 bit number instead of allowing Electrum to generate a 12 word phrase.  For example, you could create your own long phrase (offline) and use the SHA-256 hash (created on an offline computer) of that phrase to seed you Electrum wallet.  You could create a 2 of 2 multisig wallet in Electrum using the SHA256 hashes of two different phrases. \n\nFor example, the SHA256 hash of 'On October 17, 1832, Knight Rider premiered on BBC 17.' is 2d6016399fe4d6bb50c737e6ce7e57b0f8ca1b43290beff4560a157e2ae09011 (This is just a very weak example.  I would never use this as one of the phrases that I would use to create one of my SHA-256 hashes.  For security reasons, I will not explain my own methodology, but the more complex a phrase you create, the more secure your coins will be.  The reason for this is simple: a more complex phrase is harder to guess, so an attacker is left having to guess your SHA-256 hashes: an incredibly time consuming and difficult process.  Right now he'd have to guess two hashes if you chose a 2 of 2 mulitisig.  In the future, when Electrum goes to M of N multisig, the attacker will have no idea how many SHA 256 hashes you used, so he is going to have to try to guess different combinations.  It frankly won't be worth his time, he'll move on to easier targets).\n\nThe phrase is just used to create the hash => you don't need to keep it.  All that you would need to store is the two SHA-256 hashes that you used to seed your wallet. You would create the wallet by going to File => New/Restore => Restore wallet + multi-signature wallet => 2 of 2 => NEXT => enter your two SHA-256 hashes.  This works because your 12 word passphrase just represents a 256 bit number.  So for someone to just randomly guess both of your SHA-256 hashes is on the order of centuries: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=120473.0 \n\nWARNING:  you don't want to use any phrase found in a book, article, online, a movie etc to create your SHA-256 hash.  Hackers are very smart and they use Rainbow Tables to store hashes of common phrases found online and in other popular sources.  However, the principles used in creating a good password could also be employed in creating a precursor phrase for a good SHA-256 hash.  For example, what if you created an extremely long phrase full of nonsense, non existing words, words  in different languages etc.  This would be almost impossible to guess.  So the hacker trying to steal your coins would be left trying to guess two random SHA-256 hashes.  He would then have to test each two hashes he guesses by creating an Electrum wallet to see if it has any coins in it.  This would be such a slow process that it would take a determined hacker thousands of years (or more) to find a wallet with actual coins in it.  Electrum will eventually go to M of N multisig wallets, making it even harder on hackers.  Imagine if you had to guess 17 SHA-256 hashes to hack a wallet.\n\nThe longer the phrase you choose, and the more illogical it is, the less chance that someone would ever randomly guess it.  By making it multisig, they would have to guess both of your phrases or both of your SHA-256 hashes.

": 2, '> I don\'t understand why would you reject a block if everyone else is accepting it\n\nThis is precisely why, given the option to control the maximum acceptable inbound block size, no miner would voluntarily choose to reject it, unless it was truly out-of-bounds.\n\nIn other words, each miner would set a max blocksize for incoming blocks that was high enough to never reject any block that was in other regards "valid".': 1, "In bitcoin, we require all participants to agree on some set of rules.

These rules include the proper structure of the block, the coinbase transaction not exceeding the block subsidy + transaction fees, a proof of work lower than the current difficulty target, and the maximum size a block is allowed to have.\n\nAs an aside, I believe a lot of confusion is caused by people refering to the maximum block size miners mine themselves as the 'soft limit', which is not really similar at all to the actual consensus critical 'hard' limit.

If we consider a simplified model where blocks are propagated instantly and the attacker has less than 50% of total hashpower, a security against double-spends depend on the number of confirmations, and thus shorter intervals are beneficial.\n2. However, if block propagation delay is non-zero, an attacker who is close to 50% can get an additional boost, thus it is easier to pull off 51% double-spend attack.\n\nThus it is a trade-off: reducing block interval improves one thing, but makes another thing worse. There should be a sweet spot somewhere.\n\nE.g. suppose that with 10 minute interval and the current block size limit (and sync algorithm) a global orphan rate is around 1%. This means that in principle an attacker who owns 49% of all hashpower might overpower the network.\n\nIf we reduce the interval to 5 minutes, the orphan rate goes to 2% and now an attacker with 48% of the total hashpower can overpower the network.\n\nBut if a merchant ships the goods after 3 confirmations in the first case, he might wait for 6 confirmations in the second case. This reduces risk of double-spend from 10% to 1% for an attacker with 47% of an apparent hashpower.\n\nThus reducing the block interval improves protection against an attacker wiht 47% of total hashpower, but makes it more vulnerable to an attacker with 48% of total hashpower.

I dunno... call that what you will.  There certainly is potential for price to reach very high numbers - the data is out there, draw your own conclusions.  I don't consider that as a ponzi.  (People speculate on the future price of stocks, housing, gold, currencies, you name it.)  It's too bad it's not possible to discuss the future of bitcoin without it degrading into focusing on price and whether that means it is a ponzi.\n\nJust curious though, what you would think if it does reach some astronomical number in the future?

If the price stops growing faster than stock returns -- say, less than ~10%/year -- the hoarders will no longer want to hoard it, and will try to sell. That will lead to a runaway crash.

Long-term investors in housing get their profit from rent paid by people who use those houses.  \n\nSpeculators, on the other hand, get their profit from the losses of other speculators.  One can speculate with stocks, to try to get with speculation a higher profit than the dividends one gets just by holding; but this extra profit must come from the loss of other speculators.

Unfortunately, until someone understands it, that sort of talk will totally cloud the reality.\n\nHowever, while I do see many people who seem to think that it\'s purely some sort of get rich quick scheme, there are a huge number of advocates who state over and over that it is NOT about just buying into it for an investment.  \n\nI still hold my view that the stated abilities are incomprehensible to most (I see it over and over people saying that once they took the time to understand it they changed their views and were blown away).

(no)\n\nI don\'t agree. Bitcoin\'s decentralization and security properties are essential components of what make it (potentially) sound money.  If users are just trusting miners, or parties are free to rewrite the rules, then the soundness can be compromised.\n\nAnd there is always ~some~ excuse that sounds good to someone, ... just a little QE to prevent economic collapse, or hey, all those poor MTGOX users, lets restore their lost coins.  The security properties of Bitcoin are what take \'tweaks\' like that off the table.\n\n> Does it lose its censorship resistance? (\'maybe\' -- depends how centralizing 20MB blocks are, but again I would lean towards \'no\' based on my calculations\n\nI\'d like to see these calculations, because right now any user of Bitcoin could effectively be silenced by the decision of six or less parties (I believe it\'s actually less, but 6 is conservative).  We\'re already in a situation where they could choose to do this, but don\'t.\n\nSome technical people have proposed blocking and coin-confiscation initiatives, including the person who created Bitcoin-XT---- always justified with reasonable sounding causes (e.g. kidnapping, coin theft, and cryptolocker).\n\n> also, if Bitcoin ever became centralized and truly corrupted, then it would be forked and one would simply run the fork with \'sound money\' as the utility\n\nUnfortunately, as a consensus system you can\'t just choose the behavior based on the software you personally choose to run. What you can instead say is that an altcoin could be created and people (who care) could try to sell off their bitcoins to move to the altcoin... which is true, but doing that fragements the market and makes cryptocurrences seem unattractive to outsiders ("why use this when I may just have to flee to its replacement")-- this process of birth and replacement also undermines the sound-money property when you consider the system and its replacement jointly.\n\n> Does it lose its irrevocability? (no)\n\nAt some point it indeed does.  A majority of hashpower can revoke any payment. (or even a large submajority; with high probability, if the payment was recent).  We\'ve even seen this happen before where a party in control of a large amount (I believe ~30%) of hashpower used it to finney attack a gambling site and stole around 1000 btc (they claim they were \'hacked\').\n\nregarding:\n\n> Open-source, programmable, extensible money (no -- Bitcoin does not lose this property with an increase in block size -- further, Bitcoin will never lose this fundamental property compared to fiat)\n\nThis is essential for Bitcoin but not necessarily practically useful on its own. Sure you can go make your own modified version of today\'s software. But if the rules are different it would be an altcoin; and I can promise you that a cryptocurrency where you are the only user is really boring. :).  For all you know (though I don\'t think this is a very likely outcome), future miners could require you to use wallets that remote attest to their code, so they can promise they won\'t intentionally double spend or break AML rules-- so even if your software was compatible with the rules of the network you might not be able to use it. There are certainly people in this space thinking about ways to do things like that.\n\n': 1, 'To be clear, I\'ve shared this link for the purpose of truth-seeking discussion, not for blind ideologically-driven advocacy for one side or another in the block size debate.\n\nIt includes a common refrain that gets thrown around:\n> "Without its fundamental properties, Bitcoin offers nothing that isn\xe2\x80\x99t already offered."\n\nBut, to play devil\'s advocate, is this really true?

(\'maybe\' -- depends how centralizing 20MB blocks are, but again I would lean towards \'no\' based on my calculations -- also, if Bitcoin ever became centralized and truly corrupted, then it would be forked and one would simply run the fork with \'sound money\' as the utility; so this possibility would serve to lessen chance of corruption of the protocol after centralization)\n* Does it lose its irrevocability? (no)\n* Does it lose its quality of being a cheap form of payment (and by implication, function in micropayments)? (no -- obviously not, since bigger blocks means low fee pressure as block size will be made to scale with transaction volume -- further, Lightning and similar solutions will guarantee cheap payments)\n\nThese value propositions differentiating Bitcoin from Fiat are from the article.\n\nAnother may include:\n\n* Open-source, programmable, extensible money (no -- Bitcoin does not lose this property with an increase in block size -- further, Bitcoin will never lose this fundamental property compared to fiat)\n\nIn summary, I\'d like to suggest that the article reminds us not to lose sight of what makes Bitcoin Bitcoin, but that it\'s alarmist in the sense that I don\'t see how Bitcoin actually loses any fundamental properties via increasing the block size. The increase proposed (20MB) and the follow-up revisions to the proposal (4MB, 8MB, /u/jgarzik\'s market-based miner-based block size scaling, etc.) are within the bounds of maintaining a certain degree of decentralization. So, Bitcoin absolutely does offer something that is not offered by its competition (and to extend the argument further, various aspects will continue to be offered regardless how centralized it becomes).\n\ncc: /u/petertodd, /u/adam3us': 0, "Thanks for posting this.  I'd like to address a few of the issues you bring up.\n\n> Does it stop being sound money? (no). \n\nThis is a continuum.  The more people who are able to watch, the less miners need to be trusted.  Does it stop it?  Probably not.  Does it make it less sound?  I think that is always the case when it's more difficult to have a full node.\n\n>Does it lose its censorship resistance?  \n\nThis is really dependent on mining centralization.  The fewer that control transactions mined, the more easily it is to censor transactions.\n\n>Does it lose its irrevocability? \n\nIn a hard for that is backward compatible, it certainly opens that door a lot more easily.\n\n>Does it lose its quality of being a cheap form of payment\n\nDepends on security.  If no one funds miners, once the reward drops, the network becomes trivial to attack.\n\n>Open-source\n\nOpen source does not do anything, much like decentralized does not do anything.  They are both means to an end.  The open-source side means it's auditable, but again, unless you are running a full node, you have no idea what rules others are enforcing.\n\nIn short, my best guess on how a 20MB fork works out if it was widely accepted, would be it wouldn't change things *too* drastically, although mining centralization is the greatest worry.  A far bigger concern is when kicking the can down the road removes incentives to actually scale Bitcoin, and then we go to a 400MB fork next.  It's a continuum, and there's not a single straw that breaks that camel's back, but we do see things start to change fundamentally the further this is pushed.\n": 1, "Apologies for the undue generalization.

If someone managed to steal a few hundred kBTC from some powerful Chinese guy, the Chinese government might want to freeze those coins indefinitely.  They could in theory do that by forcing the Chinese miners to reject any transaction that tried to spend those coins, and to orphan any block containing such transactions.  Even if the Western miners split the coin (thus violating the protocol themselves), the Chinese miners would have enough power to block the stolen coins on the Western chain too, or to jam it completely to sabotage the split.\n\nThe Chinese miners could even force the inclusion of an exception table in the protocol, that allows those coins to be transferred back to the original owner even without a valid signature.  If the same method could be used to recover the stolen MtGOX coins, perhaps even the Western miners and users would agree to such a thing.  It would frustrate the very design purpose of bitcoin, and those who value bitcoin because of that goal would leave; but those seem to be a small minority of the users, and the rest -- investors, day-traders, drug buyers, miners, startups -- will want the show to go on...": 1, '> In fact, the MBS increase would be a fairly small change in the protocol, compared to the ones that will be required to fix transaction malleability and add the new opcodes for sidechain support.

That is not progress; it is moving back 100 centuries or more. \n\nWoah there! That doesn\'t speak for everyone. It certainly doesn\'t speak for me.\n\nThere is a _huge_ space of transactions where laws/courts/etc. simply do not work:  Paperboy steals your newspaper good luck with the civil suit or police report.  Business in china rips you off on a $100k piece of manufacturing equipment, and you\'re in the US?-- have fun fixing that.  Even on more cases where the system works, access to the courts is very expensive and this creates a huge bias where the economically advantaged have more access to justice and more outcomes in their favor.  At the same time, there are many interactions which could be arbitrated by possession, smart contracts, and other less centralized mechanisms for justice (e.g. multisig escrow with an arbitrator), where the shortcomings of those tools are still massively better than the alternative in the traditional system.  Besides, Bitcoin cannot replace traditional systems of law-- not so long as officers of the court have the physical ability to put you in a jail cell!--  but perhaps it can set better defaults and clean up a lot of cases where our current institution fail.\n\nDefault matter a lot, since there is a lot of injustice that happens just as a result of whatever it was being easy--- haircut the bank accounts in Cyprus? well just punch a few digits and done. Refuse to process a customers withdraw; because they triggered some moronic structuring detector criteria, ... easy as pie.  The fact that a system that sets potentially better results can be overridden with enough work-- like tracking someone down and locking them up-- is nothing but a virtue, as it means that an improved underlying system only has to be better, not perfect. It\'s errors can still be corrected by political oversight-- if it\'s worth the cost.\n\nThe infrastructure we have for disputes today are highly evolved, but they are also very expensive and often unfair, they are far from perfect.  Ultimately these systems are just tools, just as democracy is a tool, or communism is a tool, or multivariable calculus is a tool. Bitcoin\'s trustless machine enforced behavior is just another tool in societies toolbox.  Mankind\'s welfare will be maximized when we have the many good tools and we\'re wise enough to use the best tool for each job. With increased levels of transactions happening person to person (or even machine to machine) at a global scope that spans multiple political domains, the space where the new things Bitcoin potentially offers value over the traditional dispute systems is already very large and growing.\n\nAnd I think this perspective reflects many of Bitcoin\'s earliest users as well, ... so well, whatever this new fangled definition of "bitcoiner" you\'re using is, I don\'t buy it. :)\n': 2, "My take: [Two Approaches to Conceptualizing Bitcoin's Core Value Proposition](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/36wxdl/two_approaches_to_conceptualizing_bitcoins_core/)\n\nThe tl;dr is that Bitcoin's core value proposition is that it is (a) the first form of money to allow trustless value transfer and storage and (b) the first form of money to combine the reliable scarcity of a commodity like gold with the transactional efficiency of a purely digital medium.": 3, '> Smart contracts in the blockchain can express symbolically conditions that involve the real world, but, being just virtual artifacts cannot determine whether those conditions were met or not.\n\nIs the sale or transfer of information "real world" enough for you?

But how are really the future of means of payment, and what steps it must take to finally accepted as an accepted currency?\n- If there is something missing that currency need to function effectively as a means of payment, so it's stability, says Johan Javeus, SEB's chief strategist.\n\n>Johan Javeus, SEB's chief strategist. Photo: SEB\n\n>Bitcoin appeared in the financial crisis in 2009 and has been an outsider in the monetary system. As a virtual currency, without anchoring and control of any central bank has completely been outside all systems. In value of the currency has been a bumpy ride, there are investors who made the cut on speculating in currency and there are those who went on a mean punch in attempts to interpret the currency's future prospects.\n\n>Today, the currency primarily by investors who hope that it will rise in value. But it has not always been.\n\n> From the beginning, the enthusiasts who thought it was new and interesting and something that you could try. It was not expensive, either from the start, said Johan Javeus, SEB's chief strategist.\n\n> Nobody knew what they were really worth. The first real transaction with Bitcoins made in 2010 and consisted of a person in Florida announced in a Webforum that he was willing to pay 10,000 Bitcoins for two pizzas. Another person accepted the offer and made sure the pizzas were delivered and then bitcoinen in exchange. Today costs 10,000 Bitcoins almost 19 million Swedish crowns so in retrospect it was the right expensive pizza.\n\n>A demand for a currency is to function, it is a limitation of how much of the currency that may be on the market. The number of bitcoin available is in theory limited to about 21 million pieces.\n\n>Because there is a limited theoretical amount, it is clear that the value can go up very much, if demand for the currency in the future would increase because it is becoming more widespread and are used by more. It is the trend that investors in Bitcoins today hoping for.\n\n>But the anonymous payment means have endured a lot of criticism. The essence of the currency's popularity is that it just is anonymous and untraceable. It can also be one of the biggest disadvantages of the currency's future, according to SEB's chief strategist Johan Javeus.\n\n>I think it can be as great a disadvantage as advantage that it is not controlled by any authority or government. There is a problem when there is no Governor acting anchor to a currency, to ensure stability, he says and continues reasoning:\n\n>To use the currency to buy goods and services, so you must be able to trust that the currency keeps its value. Bitcoin has been subject to enormous fluctuations, up and down. And I think that's the biggest reason why people have trouble seeing it as a means of payment in the day, but rather looks bitcoin as an investment asset it hopes will rise in value.\n\n>And the second question, which is crucial for the future is how the currency should be checked, according Javeus.\n\n>There must eventually be a legally clarified the status of the currency. Frequently currencies in the banking system has the advantage that the transactions can be traced so then we know where the money is going, it is important not least for enforcement authorities, so that the currency is not used for money laundering or drug deals. This type of control is impossible to do with bitcoin today and therefore there are question marks about states will allow bitcoin to grow as a means of payment. If we do not solve this so it may be the death knell for a currency bitcoin, but we are not there yet.\n\n>The positive currency that is highlighted is the simplicity of making a transfer online.\n\n>What is portrayed as the benefits of currency is that it is quick to make transactions, you can make a payment in day arrives seconds of the receiver even if the person sitting on the other side of the globe. It facilitates trade across borders. Sending money through the traditional banking system does not take really long time, but it still takes a few days.\n\n>What do you think about Bitcoins the future?\n\n>It would be wrong today to calculate it, but for it to survive, you have to, as I said clarifying the legal status of the currency. Then I think you have to get to a regulated market for the companies that are doing bitcoin. It will be necessary for many reasons, not least consumer protection, if the currency is to become really widespread in the future.\n\n>Footnote: SEB is not or accept Bitcoin as payment.\n\n>Advert\n\n>This article is a sponsored content.

"Some", because I am not a native English speaker myself, so I might have not caught all of them and the grammar explanations might not be sufficiently complete and correct.\n\n> I looking\n\nYou have correctly used the continuous form of the verb "to look", since you are still in the process of performing that action. However, this form requires the additional use of the verb "to be", which must be in first person singular form, i.e., "am". Therefore, the correct expression is "I am looking".\n\n> enthusiasts who wants\n\nSince "enthusiasts" is third-person plural ("they"), you need to use the corresponding verb form, which is "want" (without the "s"). Third person singular (he/she/it) wants, everybody else want.\n\nAlso, while using the verb "want" is grammatically correct here, it is usually used to indicate a rather immediate and urgent need ("I want it now!"). Since you are essentially requesting something, it would be more polite to use "would like" instead. That\'s true even in Russian, I think.\n\n> At first\n\nThis is useless (even in Russian, although a bit less so) since you are not specifying anything else that you would like to happen later.\n\n> i wants\n\nSince you are speaking in first person singular ("I"), you have to use the corresponding verb form, which is "want" (without the "s", see above). Also, proper English requires that "I" is capitalized, although on the Internet many people don\'t bother doing it.\n\n> to up my english\n\nYou don\'t "up" your command of a language; you "improve" it. Also, language names should be capitalized.\n\n> with native speaker\n\nThis phrase is used when you want to indicate that you want to perform some kind of activity with somebody else as a company. Like, "I want to go sailing with a beautiful girl". Since in this case you are looking for a native English speaker to perform some action on you (namely, to improve your English), as opposed to just hanging around for company, it would be better to use the phrase "because I would like him (or her) to improve my English".\n\n> also\n\nUnlike Russian, English has several words that have this meaning - "also", "too", "as well", "both", etc. Which one you need depends on the context but your choice here doesn\'t strike me as the most correct one. (I have a problem with that too, since in my language we use one and the same word too.) The whole sentence is better written as "This is because I would like a native English speaker to help me improve both my spoken and my written command of the English language".\n\n> Why i looking\n\n1. "I" must be capitalized.\n\n2. The continuous form of "look" requires the verb "to be".\n\n3. Since you are asking a question (as opposed to making a statement), the "to be" verb must precede the "look" verb.\n\nSo, the correct phrase is "Why am I looking".\n\n> bitcoin become\n\nThe present tense ("become") is not appropriate here. Either "bitcoin has become" if the act has already been performed, or "bitcoin is becoming", if the act is still continuing with no end in sight.\n\n> may become a good point of contact\n\nA point of contact is the area where one object touches another. In this case you probably mean that it might be a good topic for conversation.\n\n> If you interested\n\nThis phrase is missing the modal verb "to be". Since it is in second person singular, the proper form is "are". Thus, "If you are interested".\n\n> in\n\nIn what? You don\'t leave sentences hanging like that, even if you just explained it above.

As a consequence, suspicion remains (e.g. suspicions of collusion of mobile operators in Europe).\nActually I don\'t see how users can voice their preferences with this model.

That power should not rest within software.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBitcoin is unlike most other markets. In most markets, there are physical limits on resources, and the market finds out how to be most productive under these limits.\n\nIn Bitcoin, everything is abstract and ruled by consensus. Limitations are placed artificially to make sure the system isn\'t gamed. For the same reasons we have hardcoded rules for inflation schedule and time between blocks, we could have hardcoded rules for the block size.\n\nWe should strive for rules that are flexible and dynamic, reducing the sensitivity to parameter choice. But that doesn\'t mean we should just put whatever automatic system we can think of. This can result in far worse things than the central planning risk.\n\ne.g., I proposed once [a system for dynamically choosing time between blocks](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=79837.0). This would give more power in the decision to market forces. But there were missing pieces of the puzzle, and without them resolved the proposal is dangerous, so I\'m not actively promoting it, we\'re fine with hardcoded rules. (And I do hope that eventually, the hardcoded rules will be that we have GHOST and reduce to 5-sec blocks).\n\nSo yes, I do propose a new static size for the time being (and a better mechanism in the future). It\'s not perfect, but better than letting miners vote.\n\nPS: As in my other comment, I also suggest considering "vote by Bitcoin days destroyed".\n\n> Miners incentives are aligned with users long term.\n\nMiners will choose whatever maximizes their profit. They will keep Bitcoin still usable; but at much higher fees than are justified, resulting in Bitcoin being much less useful to humanity than it should have been.\n\n> Collusions, attacks etc must take place in months, in slow motions, for months at a time.\n\nVoting on a self-serving block size does not require an explicit collusion or overt attack.

Users lobbying mining pools by emails every 3 months in order to influence the vote doesn\'t seem a credible scenario. \n\n\nMoreover, it\'s very likely that the increasing population of people using online services will always ask for bigger blocks since they don\'t support the cost of a full node (http://edandethan.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/satoshi.jpeg). \n\n\nIMHO, if there\'s a "market" which should decide of the blocksize limit, it\'s the community of full node owners.

My feeling is that 3 months is a too short period. Moreover, I don\'t think that a majority of users lobbying miners every 3 months is a sustainable solution (see principle of least effort https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_effort). \n\n- Like Meni, I don\'t think that interests of miners & users are aligned.\n\n- This kind of off chain feedback loop (like lobbying by email) isn\'t resistant to sybil attacks.\n\n- It may sound very anti-democratic but I believe that one should be allowed to vote if she has sacrificed something (same principle as miners "burning" electricity).\n  Investing a minimum (running a full node) to support the values of bitcoin (decentralization & censorship resistance) seems to me like the minimum required.\n  Peter Todd has proposed that users vote with their transactions but I\'m not fond of this proposal for the same reason.\n  The counterparty of this "elitist" point of view is that barriers to entry (running a full node) should remain as low as possible.\n  \n\n> More importantly, critics fail to come up with a good alternative: Other solutions -- including simply hard forking to a new static size like 2MB -- are fraught with central planning risk. The block size limit creates how the fee market behaves. That power should not rest within software.\n\n\nI agree that your proposal tries to address the fundamental problem while many others just kick the can down the road.\nBut conservative approaches, like a new static limit, are also a way to buy more time to come up with a solution which isn\'t decided in emergency. That\'s not so bad.\n\n\nAll these points might seem quite negative but, once again, I\'m very grateful for this document.\nI\'ve spent a lot of time on forums, mailing list to better understand this problem of scalability but I know many people can\'t spend so much time on these matters. \nHaving a document summarizing the context and the issues was much needed and should be very useful to have a consensus.

It seems the interests of miners and node operators (ignoring their reasons for running a node) are aligned here, given node operators receive no compensation for their bandwidth and processing. Marginal users are disadvantaged by higher fees (which presumably would disproportionately hurt poorer countries. \n\nWould it help if miners can only vote the blocksize *up*? This would presumably make them more cautious about increasing it, but would also prevent them from squeezing the market once it\'s expanded.\n\nEvery time I think this through I ended up reaching the conclusion the problem can only be solved in the market if nodes are compensated somehow. That raises the question: do miners pay nodes to relay new blocks to secure their new coins, or do nodes pay to download blocks to see their confirmed transactions? \n\nIf miners must pay, presumably the rule is that a "new block" is one not seen by a given node, but that would stop blocks relaying as why would a neutral node pay one further out in the network to relay a block that they otherwise don\'t care about? It would at least offer an economic way in to discourage large blocks: you could make the fee proportional to the size of the block. \n\nIf nodes must pay to download blocks then there\'s no way to create an economic incentive on miners to remove spam. \n\nMaybe the solution has to go both ways: nodes broadcasting new transactions pay a transaction relay fee to other nodes and/or a fee to download the block containing that transaction, but which can only be redeemed on receiving a block containing the transaction. Each node can then deduct a portion of the fee and use the rest as an incentive for further relaying (similar to TTL in TCP/IP I guess). At the mining end, the miner is presumably more interested in relaying the block to gain the block rewards coins than in profiting in running a node, so they\'ll run a node that uploads blocks for free, or pays in the reverse direction. They may even want to run many of these around the world, as it\'s presumably better to subsidise nodes than lose out on block rewards from slowly-relayed blocks. This at least solves the problem of "why should you pay to upload a block?", as for-profit nodes are still holding a claim for relaying the transaction forwards and/or the block backwards, and if they deem the block so large that it outweighs the relay fees, they can demand a larger fee. (Left unsolved is who pays who to sync the blockchain, when there is no transaction attached to the network activity.) \n\nCan\'t help but feel the whole scheme would just be a way to financially pressure miners into running the node network though.\n\nSorry for the incoherent brain dump, I\'ll leave it there.

Are you saying that BIP-100 still includes an implicit hard cap of 32MB?": 2, 'Meni this is a great analysis of Jeff\'s proposal.  I partially agree with many of your concerns.  Let me briefly comment on the proposals you mentioned. \n\n\nRegular flame war.\n\nI actually agree that this solution may not be that bad.  However the problem is that if the system grows the number of people and organisations involved could expand and the debates could become less well informed and highly influenced by government. \n\n\nJeff\'s proposal.\n\nI understand your concerns and the proposal is far from perfect, but I actually don\'t think this proposal is that bad. Miners may vote to maximise reveneue in the long run.  The industry will respond in some ways to consumer demand.  If demand increases and fees increase, then more and more people will stop using bitcoin because of the high fees.  The mining industry should notice this change in price elasticity of demand and make a judgement about this when they vote on the blocksize limit.  At the same time if demand falls the fee will start to decline and the remaining hard core users may have a more inelastic demand curve, so miners decide to lower the limit.   The interests of miners and users is not perfectly aligned, but there is a strong relationship in the long run or period for which the vote takes place.  This proposal is therefore superior to the median blocksize rule, when more short term mining interests are at play.\nWith respect to cellphones, yes there would be less cellphones which cost more, however cellphone manufacturers would vote for a profit maximising limit and there would be plenty of cellphones around.  The trouble is there would be a lack of innovation, profits would be high enough and there would be no incentive to research and make a iPhone.   Luckily we only need miners to include transactions in blocks not design new products.  The mining industry is unique and no analogy is perfect, but I think this proposal is a reasonable compromise.\n\n\nBitcoin days destroyed vote.\n\nThis is a system run by the wealthy for the wealthy.\n\n\nOn balance I actually prefer your elastic limit plus rollover pool combined with the median blocksize rule.  However Jeff\'s proposal is far simpler, easier to implement and avoids a "political polynomial" present in you proposal, which could cause arguments.\n': 2, "The world is not so simple as users lobbying miners every three months.  Miners will be proactively transparent and aware of user needs - because the alternative is to publicly go against user needs for years, and presume that will have no impact on miner's own income - bitcoin value.\n\nIf you assume miners will misbehave so badly as to disservice bitcoin users for years on end, give up now :)  Miners already have the power to collude to censor transactions.\n\nA new static limit is not a free market approach.  A new static limit implies another hard fork in the short term.  Making hard forks easy is a negative trend.  A new static limit also makes it impossible to make meaningful medium term plans about bitcoin.  Maybe hard fork #3 will go to 20MB?  It is unpredictable, and that means bitcoin's $3b economy is unpredictable.\n\nA slower, long term, block vote reduces political/governance risks that are invisible but key to bitcoin's health.  A slow vote gives the free market plenty of time to voice its input in 1,000 little ways.  Avoid abrupt or unpredictable changes - those are market shocks.\n\nBIP 100 provides the best _transition structure_ by simultaneously being slow + flexible by taking free market input.\n\n": 3, '>Bitcoin days destroyed vote.\n>This is a system run by the wealthy for the wealthy.\n\nCan you explain? A vote by actual use of the system seems fairest to me (BDD might not be a perfect proxy, but it\'s a start). It\'s no more "by the wealthy" than a vote by miners.': 2, 'The block size is already set by individual miners, as they choose which transactions, and how many, to put into a block.\n': 2, 'Followup, with the recent addition to the document in mind.\n\nI\'m all for mechanisms to let the market decide. But a market functions properly only when certain conditions are met. Among other things, it requires consumers to pay for what they consume, producers to be compensated for what they produce, and to have no artificial barriers to increasing supply.\n\nThese conditions are not satisfied by the Bitcoin network, and they will be even less so if the voting mechanism is implemented. In such bad conditions, I think design-by-internet-flame-wars might actually be better than the "market".\n\nOn one side of this you have the nodes, which currently have no way to charge for their services. We want it to be easy to run nodes to keep the network decentralized, so we want to limit the size of blocks. A committee can do this. The market of miners, probably not.\n\nOn the other side you have the users, who want to transact on the network with competitive fees. In normal markets, if prices go too high, it becomes profitable to increase production, and any entrepreneur is free to do so. But here we want to enable a vote to impose an artificial rule that limits supply. Fees can inflate arbitrarily, and nobody can produce more block space in response.\n\nThink about how such a thing would play out in any other market. Let\'s say manufacturers of cellphones would be able to vote on a rule that limits the total number of cellphones that can be produced around the world. They would choose a number much lower than the number of devices today; prices would skyrocket, as will the profits. Luckily, in most markets, nobody would even consider giving the industry players such power.\n\nThe size of the effect depends on the necessity of the product in question, but it is always true that lack of competition is good for the producers, and bad for the consumers.\n\nIn our case, the miners won\'t choose a limit so low that people will stop using Bitcoin altogether, but they will choose a limit that will force people to pay much more than they objectively should.\n\nJeff suggests that public scrutiny and stake in Bitcoin\'s health would keep miners in check, but that is as ineffective as it would be in any other market. Notably, voting on limits would not require any explicit collusion or overt attacks.\n\nPerhaps the time scales involved in the voting would mitigate this, and perhaps this is really the "lesser of evils" after all... But to me, letting the cat guard the cream, and giving a single group the power to decide in an ecosystem consisting of several groups, is a bad start.\n\nI think the best overall plan is to have hardcoded parameters, chosen with bargaining and debates like the current one, as part of a system that minimizes the sensitivity to the choice (e.g. [my proposal here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/389pq6/elastic_block_cap_with_rollover_penalties_my/) or other ideas).\n\nIf not, another idea (not sure if suggested before, might warrant its own discussion): Vote by Bitcoin days destroyed. Let users configure their choice in the client, and mark it in their transactions. This way we can make a vote based on the desires of the people actually using the system.': 9}, ('Maybe, a metaphor.', 0): {"Yeah that's less of a metaphor and more of a lie.

Cap should be as high as safety permits. \n\n> It's like the max occupancy limit at a popular nightclub. You want to set it as high as you safely can, but you can't raise it just because people are forming a line to get in.\n\nWe need some mechanism to determine what's safe and again /u/moral_agent has some good suggestions.\n\nBelow that safe limit, there is no need to impose centralised rules on the size of blocks, market forces can take care of that. We don't need High Priests dictating that we should have a voting mechanism for determining the most economical block size any more than we need High Priests declaring the limit themselves.\n\nThe only reason we might need a vote is that there is a competing, also valid, concern namely the ability to accommodate much larger adoption in the near future. That tension is difficult to resolve through some fixed algorithm. The fact that it needs to be done soon, either because you think it's really necessary or only necessary to avoid a damaging hard fork, makes it even more difficult. From that point of view a vote is reasonable.\n\nBut it's only an emergency decision taken under pressure. History teaches us emergency powers should come with clear limits and sunset clauses. And even ordinary legislation isn't simply taken by simple majority vote. It is also constrained by constitutional safeguards that can only be changed by a supermajority, subject to ratification by citizens and/or states.\n\nAll we need now is an emergency compromise that gives us time to come up with a better long term solution, in other words, kicking the can down the road as Gavin says. It's neither needed nor desirable to try to come up with a solution that fixes the scaling problem for all times. \n\nI'm arguing it's not a compromise without a hard cap. A hard cap of 32MB may be too high from a decentralisation point of view today, but it would eventually be overtaken by Nielsen's law, so it's not a disaster. Open-ended growth is a radical decision we don't need to take now. It also goes much further than what Gavin was proposing.

This solution I drew above uses private games as the barrier for bots while paying bots as nodes to hold up the integrity of the private game using the jury pool system that pokereum has used in their solution. ': 1, 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vxjxE-7QMAvo95UzhWftWJ3Ke_gAoNLTQQEudNeUQeY/edit': 1, 'This is the philosophy/theory behind the setup as I understand it: https://thewealthofchips.wordpress.com/2015/06/15/3194/\n\n**The Future Model for Poker Sites**\n\nPoker players need a profitable game in order to secure the integrity of it. Having a profitable game to a certain extent and beyond, arises the inevitability that \xe2\x80\x9cmalicious players\xe2\x80\x9d will use bots for maximum profits.  These bots will be maximally scaled for maximum profits for the malicious player/party that sets up the bots.\n\nThis is not unlike today\xe2\x80\x99s massive stables run by large staking entities. A new game like \xe2\x80\x9cspin n go\xe2\x80\x9d arises and stakers/coaches seek to exploit the profits and change to the maximum degree. Just like large staking groups, bots will inevitably bring the profitability of the game down to a certain level.  Any solution to the technical flaws or economic systems of the game should take both these phenomenon into account.\n\n**Profitability IS Security**\n\nThere are a few major complaints that have been growing in the consciousness of the collective players over time.  Software advantages are often discussed by players as something that gives certain players an unfair edge over others.  This is much like another issue that is becoming more and more a reality-bots.  These two issues are also very inter-related with the possibilities of collusion amongst players or bots. However these issues should not be the TRUE concern in the eyes of the individual or the collective player.  Truly the only issue that matters here is the profitability. If a certain game is profitable for the individual, and especially more profitable than today\xe2\x80\x99s current equivalent, then why should this player care if there is any human players at all?!\n\n**Private Games are the Future of Poker**\n\nIn the diagram of decentralized serverless poker, there is a distinction made between private games and public games.  Private games simply require an invite of some sort and public games are more of the wild west with randomized seating.  Randomized seating solves the problem of collusion PROVIDED one party doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold a major economic majority of the entire field.  Although unlikely such a situation could be solved further, much like bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s 51% attack, by decentralizing the major bot/staking pools that might arise.  There is a basic formula here, an equation to see and to balance, in how profitable a game might be, in relation to n pools of bots/staking groups.\n\n**Bots (and Players) as Nodes**\n\nThe basic change from the present model to a conceived future model is that players are to act as nodes to hold up the integrity of the network rather than the traditional centralized server model nearly all sites use today.  Players essentially are then able to set up and cryptographically deal/verify their own games rather than using the more expensive traditional model of \xe2\x80\x9ccontracting\xe2\x80\x9d third party trust for such verification.  The new model elects random jury\xe2\x80\x99s from the entire pool to verify different aspects of the entire system.  PROVIDED, the majority of the jury pool isn\xe2\x80\x99t owned by a single entity, such a method can be theoretically secure.\n\nOnce again this highlights the need for a decentralized field as describe previously.\n\n**The Future Model of Sites**\n\nProvided this P2P layer exists much of the existing overhead disappears from site models. There is still much need for attracting types of player pools.  There may still be a need for other types of security solutions, however, these solutions can now be more tailored, less costly, and have the advantage of a more rapid evolution since the entry to implementation will be so much lower.\n\n**Incentivizing Bots and Malicious Entities to Cooperate**\n\nNow we have an economy in which there can be brought about an equilibrium that might prove favorable for the future of poker. Since bots can be used as verification nodes that hold up the integrity of the games (ie cryptographic dealing), it makes economic sense to use them for these purposes rather than expensive third party solutions.  On the other hand such nodes will not cooperate or participate without the proper compensation. Truly it matters not (in this context) these bots/node earn this compensation through actual gameplay, rakeback, direct payments, or shares/crypto-coin etc. This suggests there IS a great equilibrium to be found. The bots require a certain profit to verify the private game pool, and such a profit can be realized through a system equivalent to today\xe2\x80\x99s rake/rakeback systems.\n\n**The Importance of Effective Rake as a Metric and Free Market Competition**\n\nThe concept of Effective Rake plays an important but hidden role here.  Because bots can certainly act as nodes, and will also necessarily be the most profitable players in the public games AND if much of the \xe2\x80\x9ckick back\xe2\x80\x9d from private games could be paid back through a type of rakeback program, there is now levated the possibility of an effective rake standard for the public games. This entire system assumes (and indeed theoretically provides!) a certain context of free market competition where the verification nodes/bots \xe2\x80\x9cout-bid\xe2\x80\x9d each other to offer the most cost efficient solution (this suggests a lower consumer price because of such competition between node pools).\n\nWhat is important to note is the effective rake becomes defined as the market equilibrium and thus is a product of competing forces rather than an actual metric to be \xe2\x80\x9cpredicated\xe2\x80\x9d and then achieved through \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n**Isn\xe2\x80\x99t Ideal Poker \xe2\x80\x9cRake-Less\xe2\x80\x9d?**\n\nTruly the future of poker is to involve a great change in perception and also the intelligence and direction in which the entire collective of the poker community might function. This \xe2\x80\x9cfunction\xe2\x80\x9d, is and will be seen as, truly a product of the nature of rake.  When rake is allowed to be high, we will see a very perturbed society, that is not very interested in the inner workings (and macro) of the economics of the game. As rake asymptotically slides towards zero, we will expect to see a greater and greater change in this context.  As life gets breathed into the game, so too will it attract the intelligent and creative minds that gave it its first successive generations of booms.  The system described here, is both the catalyst a ultimately symptom of the beginning of the realization and implementation of such a change.\n\nIdeal Poker IS rakeless from the players perspective.

No.\n\nIt definitely does! Every day the new investors must pour in (a) enough money to buy the biycoins created by the miners, and (b) enough money to buy the bitcoins of earlier investors that are cashing out.  Since the earlier investors expect to take out more money than they put in, item (b) must grow continuously.  Moreover, for that to happen the the price has to keep increasing; which means item (a) wil increase too.\n\nSuppose, to make the computation simpler, that every investor keeps his coins for 1 month and then expects to get his money back with 10% profit.  \n\nIn the first month, the investors buy 30 days x 3600 BTC/day at 250 $/BTC, total 27.0 M$.   \n\nIn the second month, the price must be 275 $/BTC in order to give them the expected 10% profit.

However, the software can warn clients of impeding forks, months in advance, and warn that the minority version will/may stop working after that date.\n\nThe question is whether it is best to make the minority version stop working immediately after the fork deadline (by making transaction requests intentionally incompatible), or try to give clients the illusion that it still works (by keeping transaction requests formally compatible)?  The second option seems to create the risk of really serious screw-ups, especially if malicious parties see a way to do mischief during the "extra-life" period.

Most hard forks will surely be 1:99 or 99:1, and then the minority chain (old or new) will die almost immediately.  All those who care for bitcoin should aim for such outcome, whatever their personal preferences.\n\nThe problem is what will happen in the rare (but not impossible) cases when a split occurs, and the two branches have enough mining power to limp along.  Or even when the split is 1:99 but the dying branch manages to mine just one block that spends some UTXO in a different way than the other branch (a cross-branch double spend).\n\nI believe that ensuring that transaction requests will be incompatible after the fork will be better (cleaner, safer, less confusing overall) than allowing each transaction be executed on both branches (or maybe only one, depending on things that the client will hardly understand).  \n\nNote that, with compatible transactions, malicious miners, nodes, or third parties have more possibilities of sabotaging bitcoin.
