The main rub is that your real-world identity isn\'t stored in the system anywhere.\n\nSay you wanted to deposit $100 into my checking account. I could give you my bank routing number and account number, and you could send your deposit to that "digital address". Just from looking at that routing/account number alone, you\'d have no idea who I was in real life - but the bank knows, and if the police ever came to them and asked "who is the owner of account number 0123456789?" the bank could use my account number to lookup my name, address, and SSN and give it to them.\n\nSay you wanted to deposit 1 BTC into my bitcoin wallet. I would give you my bitcoin address, which functions as my digital ID within the bitcoin network, and you would send your 1 BTC transaction to that address. The difference is that there\'s no central authority here who ties that address to my real world ID - when you open a bank account, a banker takes down your name, address, and SSN before creating the account, and checks it against your government issued ID. When you create a new bitcoin address, nobody takes down any additional information or checks any ID, so there\'s no easy way in the bitcoin system for the police to ask "what is the name and address of the person who owns address 3J98t1WpEZ73CNmQviecrnyiWrnqRhWNLy?"\n\nThe various servers running in the bitcoin world do usually keep server logs, and don\'t do anything on their own to try to obfuscate IP addresses. The blockchain records all transactions that occur (which bitcoin addresses have transferred how many BTC between each other). The system is traceable in terms of server logs, IP addresses, and bitcoin addresses; it\'s just not the easiest thing to do to piece all of that together and get a clear picture of what real-world entities are exhanging BTC this way. Also, many people who use bitcoin - and certainly any criminals who try to use it - will ultimately sell their BTC on exchanges. Exchanges link traditional bank accounts to bitcoin addresses, so there\'s some potential for the exchanges themselves to be subpoenaed for their records of what bitcoin addresses have made deposits or withdrawals from what bank account numbers.

I\'m thinking you\'ve read this recent paper: http://fc16.ifca.ai/bitcoin/papers/CDE+16.pdf\n\nIf you ignore the proof-of-work and hardware costs of mining (which contribute 98% of the cost-per-transaction) you\'re still left with each transaction costing 3-10 cents USD per transaction on bandwidth, validation, and storage costs. These costs don\'t benefit from scale increases of blocksize and I think it\'s reasonable for the initiator of the transaction to at least pay for that part. At some *arbitrary* point, users of Bitcoin are going to have to bear some of the costs of using the network since miners cannot and will not be subsidized by seigniorage in the future (if the network keeps the 21M coin limit). \n\nThere\'s also plenty of technical reasons to keep the blocksize limit reasonable, but 2MB or 4MB is probably OK at this time (Edit: Provided we make changes to SigOp limits or fix the quadratic validation scaling problem with large transactions - I\'d certainly prefer the latter since it doesn\'t introduce another "arbitrary" limit).': 1, "I calculated < $400 in a 24 he span based on bitcoinfees.21.co\n\n>It's only a viable attack so long as block space is limited. \n\nNot true.  The attack is wasting space, as there are no other material effects.  Increasing the cap simply allows for wasting space more quickly at the same (actually less) cost per kb wasted.\n\n>The point being the cost to attack the network is orders of magnitude more expensive than defending it.\n\nWhat defense?  Storing spam forever?  The defense is the cap--that's why Satoshi implemented it.  For the attacker to actually start displacing bona fide users (with properly updated wallet software), he would have to increase his fees, which would be met in kind by users.  This process makes it cost prohibitive to actually deny usage through spamming.  **The cap is serving Satoshi's reason perfectly how he envisioned and described.**": 0, "I disagree. Now what? Repeating something doesn't make it true. This whole decentralization argument is the whole reason why people have settled for a minimal increase of the blocksize to 2MB instead of the 20MB or 8MB from the first proposals. Still arguing that a modest increase like that would have a catastrophic effect of some kind is just being silly. ": 2, "The most simple of all the solutions is an increase in block size. The bandwidth cost being the most tragic loss in this attack. If we're to prevent the tragic loss in of bandwidth (which didn't impact transactions during this attack) it would require a lot of redesign to how bitcoin works.\n\nThe storage costs in this equation are insignificant.": 1, 'This attack worked so well because the attacker only had to fill the small remaining blockspace that is left after all the legitimate transactions filled up the biggest part of a block already. And after that, ever additional transaction starts clogging up the network. These kinds of attacks will become easier to pull off and their effects only get worse the closer we get to full blocks.': 19, '>A $0.01 fee costs the attacker thousands,\n\nWrong.': 2, 'Filling up larger blocks with spam forces the network to transfer and store a bunch of spam in their nodes, decreasing accessibility and decentralization which ultimately makes bitcoin worthless compared to PayPal, Square, etc... The only way to force spam off the network is to increase fees.': -1, "Yes.  In terms of bandwidth usage an attacker can make the network transmit much more data using multisig, which gets a huge discount in SegWit.  For example:\n\nHere's a simple transaction I made, 1 input and 1 output, the smallest transaction possible, it is 191 bytes:  https://blockchain.info/tx/d75464a47bc67064e81136cfa1050c8b60387460c80aa82d57c8a61571d441a0\n\nAnd here is a 8 of 15 multisig transaction I made, with similarly 1 input and 1 output.  It is 1186 bytes:  https://blockchain.info/tx/df8f5aa8b2325bdb860a76587eb0140eb5992e67cc2fa9bf5575991ffa12197a\n\nIn Segwit, much of that multisig data doesn't go into a block, but the miners and network have to have it to verify the transaction.  So with SegWit, an attacker targeting bandwidth gets more bang for their buck, so to speak.": 2, "Practically I never paid a fee until mid 2013 when I paid a $0.50 fee based on that rule. \n\nthe prevention of a spam attack has always been the motive to limited block space.\n\nIn a dishonest attempt to leave it in, removing it is being labeled as technical where the majority who argue that on technical grounds firmly beleve that it's needed as an economic motivator to increase fees.": 1, 'A spam attack only hurts users if it forces them to increase the fees they need to pay. Filling up a block with low fee transactions accomplishes nothing. Therefore, filling up 2MB with inexpensive spam is irrelevant. But filling up an already almost full 1MB with high fee transactions is extremely cheap for an attacker.': 2, "Cost of filling up 2MB with spam will not be that expensive either, it's a ridiculous statement. Increasing the blocksize doesn't help with someone with enough funding and bad intentions.": -2, "Satoshi implemented it at a time when block reward had little value and all transactions had no fees.\n\nThe distortion you're trying to prevent is caused by the fact that the network is subsidizing transaction to the tune of $5-$10 per transaction with monetary inflation.\n\nThe important point is that the fees are more expensive than the cost to store the transactions. The market will prevent unsolicited transactions in the future when the true cost is realized. \n\nThe case now is centralized planning to prevent subsidized transactions from happening.  It's just a fact of economics that subsidies distort prices. \n\nIt's not a long term threat given we know the subsidies will be cut in half ever 4 years. And we know miners are going to need economics of scale to supplement their income.": -1, "How much did it cost? I herd report of $10 to $20,000 in fees. The point being the cost to attack the network is orders of magnitude more expensive than defending it. \n\nIt's only a viable attack so long as block space is limited.
