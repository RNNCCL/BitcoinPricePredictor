So, expect bitcoin to bubble bigger and bigger until it rivals national currencies and becomes a widely used medium of exchange, since that's the only thing that can realistically put the bubbling to an end. The only other thing that could happen is that some other cryptocurrency becomes more valuable than bitcoin. But as the value of a decentralized ledger is directly related to the amount of time it's been around, I don't really expect this to happen. ": 1, "Ask yourself why bitcoin has any value at all.   I see two main drivers:\n\n- Since bitcoin is traded on unregulated markets, the answer must be that there are people who aren't willing to sell bitcoin at *any* price.  So, the absolute baseline market cap of bitcoin is roughly the sum of all of the money that has been invested in bitcoin, with no intention of selling.  This number can go down if people lose faith in bitcoin, and it can go up if more people are convinced that it has long term value.  Bitcoin's *actual* market price is determined by people who think the value will go up between when the buy and when they sell or spend.  So if the price goes from $1200 to $200 and then stops going down, that means that there's a significant amount of people who think that bitcoin will be worth at least $1200 again at some point in the future.\n\n- The longer bitcoin stays around, the more secure it gets, and the more trust society places in it not to fail.  Ultimately, value is based on trust.  The reason the US dollar is so valuable is because it's been around in one form or another for centuries, and it has a very wide user base.  People hold dollars because they trust that it won't suddenly become worthless, because it has a history of not suddenly losing value and there are hundreds of millions of people who won't divest from the dollar, no matter what.  The same is true of gold.  Interestingly, this causes a positive feedback loop wherein the more people who are long an asset, the higher that asset's value goes, causing more people to buy in, etc.  \n\nThe difference between bitcoin and these older assets is that every time there's a bubble, bitcoin gets a huge amount of attention in the media, exposing people to bitcoin who hadn't heard of it before.  A fraction of these new people will inevitably choose to start investing in bitcoin long-term, because they see the promise of the tech and the *potential* for it to become the world's future reserve currency.  The baseline for the market price is now higher.  Rinse and repeat.\n\nThere's really only one thing that could stop this process, and it's that a fatal flaw is found in bitcoin's protocol that another cryptocurrency fixes.  This would cause bitcoin to fade away, and the new currency to take its place.

This makes the difficulty go down which decreases the cost for the remaining miners.\n\nMining will always trend towards a point where there only are small profits for the few miners who can do it the most cost efficiently.\n\nThis is also why mining has centralized in China, the two biggest costs in mining are electricity and hardware.

I'll have to look into this.\n\nYou can send the payment to a mutually trusted escrow agent, and have them release the coins to the seller only after you have received the goods.

Any 2 of the 3 of you (You, the seller, and the escrow agent) to move the coins. You send the coins to that address, and once you have received the goods you and the seller can sign a transaction which moves the coins to the seller's address. In the event of a dispute, you and the seller will be unwilling to sign the same transaction since you'll be disagreeing about who should get the coins.
