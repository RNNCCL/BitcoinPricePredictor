Surely it's not. Because if anyone gets access to your piece of paper with your seed on, you're screwed. If someone got the USB they couldn't do jack with it because it's encrypted.

Seed without passphrase is useless the same way passphrase is useless without the seed. You need to have both to create the wallet.\n\nThe main difference is the amount of entropy. Passphrase is something user has to remember end enter, i.e. it\'s usualy much less bits of entropy than the seed (256 bits).\n\nUsing Trezor without passphrase (this is equivalent to empty passphrase) is perfectly secure as long as nobody gets hold of the seed since the seed cannot be guessed with all that entropy.

So you'd have to enter the seed into a computer, which defeats the entire purpose of it.\n\nThe Trezor firmware needs to perform this calculation itself, and just show you the different shares.  I don't know if SL plans to implement this or not.  \n\nIn the meantime, you have to balance the risks of theft and loss.  More copies leans toward risk of theft.

If you have enough cash to purchase the house, then you will not need a loan and will not pay closing costs.  \n2) Average closing costs are in the range of 2% - 5%, so if someone made you pay 8% you need to file a police report because you\'ve been raped.  \n3) Closing costs do not cause you to "lose" money on your home. If you buy a $200k home, you pay the purchase price and the closing costs and you now own a $200k house. In the case I am discussing above, the analagous situation would be purchasing a $200k house, paying the closing costs, and then having the house be worth $186k by the time you move in.

In effect, the customer has purchased the home d\xc3\xa9cor items in exchange for the convertible virtual currency, and the retailer has purchased the convertible virtual currency in exchange for the home d\xc3\xa9cor items.\nBecause home d\xc3\xa9cor items are taxable, the customer owes sales tax based on the taxable receipt for the purchase of the items. The taxable receipt is the fair market value of the convertible virtual currency in U.S. dollars at the time of the transaction. However, because convertible virtual currency is intangible property, the retailer does not owe any sales tax on its exchange of home d\xc3\xa9cor items for the convertible virtual currency.\nThe retailer must record in its books and records the amount of the sale and the sales tax collected in U.S. dollars, and report the sale and remit the sales tax due in U.S. dollars when filing its periodic sales tax returns.\n\nExample 2: A vendor in New York State that accepts convertible virtual currency as payment creates custom computer software for sale to a client. The custom software is delivered to a New York location. Since the sale of custom software is not subject to sales tax, this barter transaction is an exchange of a non-taxable product for non-taxable convertible virtual currency. No sales tax is due on this transaction.\n\nExample 3: A New York State resident sends her watch to be repaired at a New York repair shop that accepts convertible virtual currency for its services. Since watch repair services are subject to sales tax, the resident owes sales tax based on the taxable receipt for the purchase of the service. The taxable receipt for the repair service is the fair market value of the convertible virtual currency at the time of the sale. The repair shop must collect the sales tax and must separately state the tax from the fair market value of the convertible virtual currency on any sales slip, receipt, or invoice provided to the customer. The repair shop must also record in its books and records the amount of the sale and the sales tax collected in U.S. dollars, and report the sale and remit the sales tax due in U.S. dollars when filing its periodic sales tax returns.': 5, '[deleted]': 1, 'So obviously we are headed to sub 300 now...

Stellar and ripple are designed to allow instant transactions. No wait for 6 confirmations or anything like that, they\'re meant to have 3 second 100% confirmations. The fork that happened in stellar was the first fork EVER. Bitcoin has forks pretty much every day, and that\'s with 10 minute blocks.\n\nThe stellar devs simply understand that fanatic ideals are less important than having an excellent product, that\'s why they chose to temporarily centralize the system until they can make sure instant confirmation will work, rather than making confirmation time longer as a failsafe to prevent forks. If you waited, say, 20 or 30 seconds with stellar you wouldn\'t be at risk, however users obviously don\'t want to wait that long.

Other implementations simply use a random `k`, which is perfectly fine if the PRNG works properly, but can be disastrous if it does not. Truth be told, developing a good PRNG is difficult, as evidenced by how many times we've seen it screwed up, so RFC6979 fixes the problem by simply introducing a deterministic value.\n\nThe key point in all of this is that if the same `k` is used for two signatures with the same key on different transactions, those signatures can essentially be reversed to derive the private key.

Moreover, you do have to trust that your wife and son do not collude during your lifetime (perhaps unlikely, but why take the risk?) I have two alternate recommendations for you, depending on your price sensitivity.\n\n1) Setup a BitGo Enterprise Basic account ($20/mo), providing a cold offline xpub for the backup key. You can use CoinKite's tool or a number of other tools to generate the cold key. This will then give you a wallet with 3 keys (BitGo, user key, backup key). Set a spending limit of X BTC/day on the wallet, and then add your wife as a second admin. Once she is an admin on the wallet, either you or she will be able to transact up to X BTC/day without the other's approval, but any spends over that will require double confirmation. BitGo enforces these policies by choosing which transactions it will co-sign. Your wife only has one key (the user key, which you also have). But because you alone retain the backup key, you retain the ability to transact unilaterally if your wife refuses to approve, or if BitGo happens to go away (unlikely). In the case of your death, she can either drain the wallet slowly, or present a death certificate to BitGo to have you removed from the wallet.\n\n2) Setup a free BitGo account and share the cold key with your wife (in a shared safe deposit box, for instance). The initial setup of the wallet is the same, but it won't have your wife as an active user on the wallet, and it won't have spending limits. You and your wife retain 2 keys between you, and have the ability to move funds if BitGo disappears. In the case of your death, you can leave her access to the account password in a safe deposit box only you control, or she can use the backup key in conjunction with BitGo to recover the funds.\n": -2, 'They are no more 1% withdrawal cost anymore now?': 3, 'The question was about a Coinkite account, and you saw an opportunity to pimp BitGo.
