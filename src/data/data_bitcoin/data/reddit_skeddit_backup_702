I could have a "one bit prefix" which would require the sender to brute force the nonce until the hash of the OP return script\'s first bit is identical to the first bit of the stealth address\'s prefix.\n\nThis can be done for as long as you want (up to 32 bits)\n\nthe trade off is that the longer your prefix is in bits, the more you elimiate other stealth transactions and the less private your transactions become (as your prefix value is public knowledge embedded in your stealth address.)\n\nbut if you think of the scaling as there being 100s of stealth transactions in each box, having a one bit prefix will lower that down to 50 you need to search, a 2 bit prefix will be 25 to search etc. if we just go by probability.\n\nI also proposed putting in 0x80 (128) for the prefix length to denote that the sender should place a full 4 byte prefix as is in the nonce field. This could be a way of using "stealth" addresses as just a mere "public address that doesn\'t reuse addresses" without the stealth aspect. (as 4 bytes will differentiate enough to where you can just find the OP RETURNS with your 4 byte prefix as the nonce and you probably won\'t find any false positives)\n\nhttps://wiki.unsystem.net/en/index.php/DarkWallet/Stealth#Computing_prefixes': 1, 'Bitcoin addresses, like hypodermic needles, are supposed to be disposable. Use them once and safely dispose of them. The main reason is privacy. There\'s more on this topic here:\n\nhttp://bitzuma.com/posts/who-needs-bitcoin-change-addresses-anyway/\n\nHowever, it\'s extremely useful to be able to publish a single address and receive multiple payments to it. One of the main uses is donations and tips, where implementing a full-blown payment solution is too costly.\n\nA stealth address gives the best of both worlds. A single address is published, while supporting privacy for payer and payee.\n\nThe process is exceedingly complex, but in a nutshell works like an inverted deterministic key pool. The payer determines the offset and conveys it to the payee using "Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman" and a feature of Bitcoin\'s built-in programming language called OP_RETURN. More on OP_RETURN is here:\n\nhttp://bitzuma.com/posts/op-return-and-the-future-of-bitcoin/\n\nI\'ve yet to see an approachable, non-expert discussion of how stealth addresses work, but have attempted to include one in my upcoming book:\n\nhttp://bitzuma.com/bitcoin-book/': 4, "This is a very accurate comparison for anyone familiar with HD wallets. ~~Not sure why you're downvoted.~~": 7, 'Is there any simple way to go about creating these yourself?': 1, "That's also not a big problem if you're downloading blocks anyway. Bitcoin Core needs to check every single transaction for validity, and it finds transactions to itself in this way. Looking for these OP_RETURN outputs would add almost no extra processing time to the normal syncing time.\n\nIt does make things more difficult for lightweight clients. Clients supporting stealth addresses will need to download and check all blocks since they checked last. This is fairly slow and bandwidth-heavy for lightweight clients. For normal addresses, lightweight clients can use a feature of the Bitcoin protocol called bloom filtering to download mostly only their own transactions, but this doesn't work with stealth addresses. That's why the developers of Dark Wallet advocate a new protocol feature called prefix filtering, which would work with stealth addresses. Currently, I think that Dark Wallet relies on Obelisk servers to index the entire block chain and find relevant stealth address transactions for them, which ruins decentralization and probably anonymity unless you run your own Obelisk server. (Obelisk <-> Dark Wallet anonymity is planned to be improved in the future.)": 2, "basically they work because of this fact:\n\n    pubkey1 * privkey2 = pubkey3\n\nand\n\n    privkey1 * pubkey2 = pubkey3\n\nSo two people who exchange public keys can generate a shared secret (pubkey3), which nobody else can re-create (because it always requires at least one of their own private keys).\n\nSo a stealth address is just a public key, and then somebody creates a random key and multiplies it against the stealth key to get a shared secret which they use to derive a payment address.  Then the OP_RETURN data is the public key of that new random key that the sender created, so the receiver can use his stealth private key and that public key to recreate the shared secret and generate the address.\n\nThere's also an additional step where the shared secret public key is added to a second stealth key, and then the second stealth private key is the only one that can get at the actual payment private key, so not even the sender can access the funds once he sends them.\n\nBut ya the main thing is that neat feature of ec math where both parties can generate a shared secret.": 5, "Alice published her public key. ECDSA (Elliptic Curve digital signature algorithm) is used in Bitcoin. \n\nBob uses ECDH key exchange (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) with his own keypair and the public key which Alice published. This creates a secret value that both Alice and Bob both can recreate, but nobody else knows it. ECDH with the private key of Bob gives the same result as ECDH with the private key of Alice and the public key of Bob. This is a neat feature of the Elliptic Curve cryptography algorithms (some other algorithms have this too, but there's more to come!). \n\nNow here's the really interesting part - Bob can now use a feature named EC multiply to combine that secret value with the public key of Alice, *which creates a valid new public key!* The remarkable thing is that Alice can now run ECDH with her own private key and Bob's public key to recreate that secret value, and then run EC multiply with it against her own private key to create the matching private key for that same public key! \n\nThis means that Alice only needs to publish one public key, and yet anybody can create brand new public keys which they can turn into addresses that nobody but themselves and Alice knows about, and send her Bitcoins. Nobody will know who the Bitcoins were meant for, even if Alice was offline the whole time. You don't need to ask her for new addresses, you create them yourself! \n\nThe problem is that she needs to find out which transactions were meant for her and run ECDH against all those public keys, trying to recover the funds when possible.

While not representing all of the AnCap movement (that is of course, [what "lunatic fringe" means](https://www.google.com/search?q=definintion+of+lunatic+fringe&oq=definintion+of+lunatic+fringe&aqs=chrome..69i57.3591j0j7&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=122&ie=UTF-8), this minority is vocal enough that I feel a parody would resonate strongly with people who spend time in enthusiast communities that attract their commentary and vocal outbursts".\n\nIs that better?  My formal position is:\n\n1. The AnCap movement *does* have a lunatic fringe.\n\n2. The people in question are highly vocal on bitcoin related boards.\n\n3. Many but not all of the most vocal people I\'m referring to are members of a very large community called F.D.R, led by "SM".\n\nI feel like this is a fair and logically consistent set of statements.': 1, 'Ok, I\'m going to explain it, on the assumption that you are not actually just trying to troll bait me into an argument.\n\nThere is a very well known stereotype of person, formed from the most vocal and outspoken members of the Anarcho Capatalist movement.  This stereotype is of someone who has completely bought into the "the free market will solve every problem, government creates every problem" mindset.\n\nI\'m actually fairly anti-statist myself, but I cannot stomach what I call the "lunatic fringe" members of the AnCap movement.\n\nMany of those members are devoted followers of an online philosopher that I named in my previous post (who I will refer to as SM for brevity), who runs a web community called FreedomainRadio (FDR for short).\n\nWhile I actually think that SM has a lot of good ideas (peaceful parenting, socratic method, examination of moral virtues in every day life), I feel he also has a lot of patently dangerous and super manipulative ideas also.  He tends to attract followers in all flavors from the very smart and reasonable, to those who are highly subject to a cult-like mentality.\n\nSome of those people, of the cult-like mentality variant, are extremely extremely vocal on boards like this, and literally cannot stop themselves from taking every single opportunity to turn any conversation into one about their own view of the world.  Its seen a lot in /r/bitcoin, but also in other webforums too.\n\nThis stereotype (the lunatic fringe anarcho-capatalist) is one that I would love to see in that video, because its already so ripe for parody.\n\nI\'m going to wrap this up now, I hope that my point was clear.  \n\nIf you have never heard of the people I\'m talking about, rather than send you a bunch of links, I\'ll just tell you that you aren\'t missing much.  Highlights include the idea that you should defoo (sever all ties with your friends and family members who don\'t share 100% extreme devotion to the anarcho-capatalist movement), and that women are responsible for all evil in the world because they are choosing assholes to breed with.

So the amount of mining power doesn\'t have a major effect on how fast coins get mined. Primarily, more mining power in more hands means more security for the network. It means it\'s harder for any one actor to get enough hardware to out-compete 50% of the whole mining network and conduct a "51% attack."\n\nThe difficulty of mining adjusts itself such that it always tends toward one block being mined every ten minutes. There\'s a little bit of slippage due to hardware coming online between adjustments so that the average has been a bit closer to 8 minutes per block in practice, but the raw amount of power involved really makes little difference in how *fast* the bitcoin gets released. The projected schedule based on a 10 minute block time can be found on [the Bitcoin Wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply). According to the table on the wiki, just over 93% of all the bitcoin that will ever exist will have been mined by 2020.

In order to use Bitcoin peer to peer You have to control the keys. Best are keys you alone control and have created yourself. Current wallets allow this fairly well.

It seems that pushing and then getting scammed by not getting anything in return would be a pretty common theme, where in a pull system this could be pulled back?\n\nYes.\n\nIf you design a commodity like digital currency it seems more attractive to create tokens which allow instant settlements, however. Like cash. You decide who you trust. Of course you have to trust the technology as well. But within that, it's really just that. Trust yourself. If you don't fully trust yourself, spread the trust as you wish. Same for transactions. \n\n> I'm interested in the blockchain, but does that make it harder or easier to trace where bitcoin goes?\n\nNope\n\nBitcoin is fully transparent. Google for block explorer and you will find tools to search the blockchain, and even [listen to it live](http://www.bitlisten.com/). You can have a completely transparent balance sheet if you like. I could e.g. proof to you that I own a Bitcoin. I could even make a transaction and show it to you. I could even sign a message with the same key and include e.g. my username. I can do all this without making the Bitcoins tangible to you.

EG: email makes fax and snail mail look like *ridiculously* inefficient ideas.\n\nFast forward to 2002. Paypal is just starting to pick up steam, and you hit a website that says "pay by CC or pay with Paypal?" If you hit "Pay with paypal" it asks if you have an account, well no.

So you ask "What good is paypal?"\n\nWell, it takes a few more years before your friends start paying *you* for stuff with Paypal (maybe art, freelance work, paying you back for lunch, whatever..) and now you have a paypal balance. *Now* that little "pay through paypal" link is way more handy.\n\nWith Bitcoin it is quite similar, though we have even more advantages than paypal for those well prepared enough to handle it.

(There are exceptions, e.g., if you need to take advantage of Bitcoin\'s censorship-resistant nature.) But in general the best reason to spend bitcoin is because you have bitcoin (and you can\'t do anything else with it). And the best reason to have bitcoin (currently) is as a highly-speculative investment. And the best reason to buy bitcoin as a speculative investment is because you believe that its properties (which, in short, combine the reliable scarcity of a commodity like gold with the transactional efficiency of a purely digital medium) will enable Bitcoin, over time, to steal market share from other forms of money that lack those properties.\n\nThat doesn\'t mean that Bitcoin\'s payment network isn\'t awesome.

Either way the economy is set for a drastic correction. Trick is to be on the right side of the ledger when that occur. Owning bitcoin is a good hedge.': 3, 'Bitcoin currently is extremely deflationary as 25 new coins created every 10 minutes.  Announcements such as Microsoft are fighting that deflation and other such announcements will continue to throughout 2015.

They give out QE money to the big investment banks with the understanding that the banks will not release that money to the public (they do this by giving the money created a profit making interest rate (and most likely also ordering them not to))\n\nAlso this is why the dollar has gained strength (artificially) and the markets "appear" strong.  This is because the investment banks that received the money put that money either in their respective digital vaults to accrue interest OR invested the money in the stock market/hard commodities and of course the financial crash cancer called derivitives.\n\nSo ye, the fed used QE to allow for banks not to default in a "Minsky moment"* This money is "damned" up behind the walls of the major investment banks (the same criminal banks that caused the financial collapse in 2007-2008).  The cracks are appearing though, and game theory dictates that this money will come crashing into the system at some point in time.\n\nWhen it does, the true value of the dollar will be **felt** by the average joe (consumer inflation and not just asset inflation).\n\nThis will be the Black Swan event that you describe.\n\n_A **Minsky moment** is a sudden major collapse of asset values which is part of the credit cycle or business cycle. Such moments occur because long periods of prosperity and increasing value of investments lead to increasing speculation using borrowed money. The spiraling debt incurred in financing speculative investments leads to cash flow problems for investors. The cash generated by their assets no longer is sufficient to pay off the debt they took on to acquire them._ \n\nedit:  if you look closely at the countries that **use** qe money (they actually spend it on public works projects etc) these countries are causing inflation of consumer prices effectively devaluing their own currency.  The key thing to understand about the QE context of the USA is they are effectively preventing the big banks from spending the money that is given to them (allowing them to print the money, but since they dont use the money, inflation never appears).  The problem with this, its like other countries are slowly devaluing their currencies, but the USA will nuclear bomb crash when all the money is released at once.': 9, 'Right, I could see the value of BTC going through the roof, and BTC blockchain not ready to handle the volume so transactions would be expensive and reserved for moving massive amounts of money.

I meant to give more information immediately, but I\'ve just been busy.\n\nSo my background is in the physical sciences, and my story of coming to Austrianism is rooted in several events in my past.\n\nThe first major stepping stone was a machine learning and artificial intelligence course I took during my undergrad. If you want to teach a machine to learn, you have to understand what knowledge is in the first place - therefore this class wound up being a class on epistemology. I would say that a solid understanding of the limitations of both deductive knowledge and empirical knowledge is really important towards understanding why bitcoin\'s economic philosophy differs so much from main stream thinking. I had previously learned about Platonic logic, but this class actually put these concepts to test in a practical situation where I had to flesh out their implications.\n\nA second major source of foundation for me was religious studies. I will admit that this is not the usual among anarcho-capitalists and Austrians. My background is in Reformation theology, and the 16th century reformers actually put a lot of time and energy into epistemological inquiries. This again forced me to think about how we know what we know and how we know when we actually know something.\n\nThen came Ron Paul, and he introduced me to the Austrian School.\n\nAs it turns out, around the turn of the last century there was a debate among economic scholars as to the scope and nature of economic inquiry. The Austrian School viewed economics as a deductive science, while the Keynesians viewed economics as an empirical science (without a null hypothesis might I point out).\n\nI could not summarize this difference better than Hans-Herman Hoppe:\n\n\n>Mises\'s answer is that economics is the science of human action. In itself, this may not sound very controversial. But \nthen Mises says of the science of economics: \n>\n>>Its statements and propositions are not derived from experience. They are, like those of logic and \nmathematics, a priori. They are not subject to verification and falsification on the ground of experience and \nfacts. They are both logically and temporally antecedent to any comprehension of historical facts. They are a \nnecessary requirement of any intellectual grasp of historical events. [2] \n>\n>In order to emphasize the status of economics as a pure science, a science that has more in common with a \ndiscipline like applied logic than, for instance, with the empirical natural sciences, Mises proposes the term "praxeology" \n(the logic of action) for the branch of knowledge exemplified by economics. [3] \n>\n>It is this assessment of economics as an a priori science, a science whose propositions can be given a rigorous logical \njustification, which distinguishes Austrians, or more precisely Misesians, from all other current economic schools. All the \nothers conceive of economics as an empirical science, as a science like physics, which develops hypotheses that require \ncontinual empirical testing. And they all regard as dogmatic and unscientific Mises\'s view that economic theorems\xe2\x80\x94like \nthe law of marginal utility, or the law of returns, or the time-preference theory of interest and the Austrian business \ncycle theory\xe2\x80\x94can be given definite proof, such that it can be shown to be plainly contradictory to deny their validity. \n\nMy primary employment is in the realm of empiricism. I\'m work on a device that stores data in the angular moment of electrons. Empiricism is the reason my employer will spend $1 Billion to figure out something that at the end of it all, we can scribble on a blackboard in 5 minutes. Empiricism always produces messy and impartial understanding, and requires continual testing and retesting, often leading to dead ends. If we had a deductive path to achieve our ends, we could simply work it out on the blackboard and skip all of the experiments! In my case, we simply don\'t have this option available.\n\nA century after this debate erupted, we can see that the Kaynesians won. Kaynesianism would draw some lines and charts that showed government spending increased wealth. Axiomatic deductive arguments could prove that government spending makes society poorer. Not so surprisingly, government funding would promote Kaynesianism for the next 100 years, and Austrianism would be marginalized to a minority position.\n\nInteresting Books:-\n\n* Economics in One Lesson - Henry Hazlitt (read this one!)\n* Economic Science and the Austrian Method - Hans-Herman Hoppe \n* Human Action - Ludwig von Mises\n* Man, Economy, and State - Murray Rothbard\n* The Law - Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric Bastiat\n\nHazlitt is perhaps one of the best expositions of how the conclusions differ in the Austrian School. **Pertaining to your original question**, this book is probably the best if you just want to understand the functional consequences of QE on the economy, but the philosophical underpinning of *why* Hazlitt looked at things differently isn\'t explicitly described (this book was originally published in newspapers, and the *whys* of it all would have been over the head of the average reader).\n\nThe second book, authored by Hans-Herman Hoppe, describes the difference in *whys* between the Austrian and Keynesian schools.\n\nMises\' Human action is *the* why book! If I recall correctly, the first volume of the work deals with the epistemological justification for praxeology, or the study of human action as an axiomatic deductive science. I would consider this a very advanced book - **graduate level** for sure. You can find the audio book online and can listen to it while commuting.\n\nI read Rothbard after Mises. In hindsight, Rothbard is much easier and may be worth reading first. He walks through a Robinson Crusoe type economy and then expands to a full fledged economy. I found every step of his logic extremely important, but if you simply skim the book you might find the arguments pedantic (which I would disagree with, but this was the feedback of my parents who don\'t have the attention span to actually read the book carefully). When using axiomatic deduction, every link in the chain must be rock-solid, which is why the concepts in this book move so slowly.\n\nI would recommend that if you read Rothbard first, you could either read volume 1 of Human Action, or at least be aware that there exists a rigorous justification for the deductive approach that Rothbard takes.\n\nFinally, I threw Fr\xc3\xa9d\xc3\xa9ric Bastiat\'s The Law because everyone should read it :-)\n\nIn the end, you might find that some answers are lacking. I believe that the proper scope of economics is not predicting which choices people will make, but rather understanding the consequences of the fact that people must make choices. While this cannot answer all questions economist pretend to answer, it still informs our understanding of *many* questions surprisingly well!\n\nGood luck on your journey of education!': 1}, ("'Bitcoin Band' To Perform in New York City (Same Guys Behind The Bitcoin Music Festival)", 1): {}, ('Fundamental Analysis [X-post r/bitcoinmarkets]', 3): {'The marginal cost of mining acts a both an attractor and a floor during downward price cycles.
