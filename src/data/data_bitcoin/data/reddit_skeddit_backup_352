Tyson's rape trial took place in the Indianapolis courthouse from January 26, 1992 to February 10, 1992.\n\n>Desiree Washington testified that she received a phone call from Tyson at 1:36 am on July 19, 1991 inviting her to a party. Having joined Tyson in his limousine, Washington testified that Tyson made sexual advances towards her. She testified that upon arriving at his hotel room, Tyson pinned her down on his bed and raped her despite her pleas to stop. She ran out of the room and asked Tyson's chauffeur to drive her back to her hotel.[citation needed] Partial corroboration of Washington's story came via testimony from Tyson's chauffeur, Virginia Foster, who confirmed Desiree Washington's state of shock. Further testimony came from Thomas Richardson, the emergency room physician who examined Washington more than 24 hours after the incident and confirmed that Washington's physical condition was consistent with rape.[63]\n>\n>Under lead defense lawyer Vincent J. Fuller's direct examination, Tyson claimed that everything had taken place with Washington's full cooperation and he claimed not to have forced himself upon her. When he was cross-examined by lead prosecutor Gregory Garrison, Tyson denied claims that he had misled Washington and insisted that she wanted to have sex with him. Because of Tyson's hostile and defensive responses to the questions during cross-examination, some have speculated that his behavior made him unlikable to the jury who saw him as brutish and arrogant.[64] Tyson was convicted on the rape charge on February 10, 1992 after the jury deliberated for nearly 10 hours.[65]\n>\n>Alan Dershowitz, acting as Tyson's counsel, filed an appeal urging error of law in the Court's exclusion of evidence of the victim's past sexual conduct, the exclusion of three potential defense witnesses, and the lack of a jury instruction on honest and reasonable mistake of fact.[66] The Indiana Court of Appeals ruled against Tyson in a 2\xe2\x80\x931 vote.[66]\n>\n>On March 26, 1992, Tyson was sentenced to six years in prison followed by four years on probation.[67] He was assigned to the Indiana Youth Center (now the Plainfield Correctional Facility) in April 1992,[68] and he was released in March 1995 after serving three years.[69]\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Tyson#Rape_conviction.2C_prison.2C_and_conversion": -4, '>governator': 3, "Dude, I'm not a butter :P": 5, 'Thanks for the correction.

However it was much worse than that.\n\nBitcoin Rush took my cleared funds out of my account! The previous day I could bet with those funds or withdraw them just like any user who has deposited their own bitcoins or had affiliate payments in their account. Then my bitcoins were simply gone from my account.\n\nI was surprised because I had always defended Bitcoin Rush as being an honest and reliable operator, I did not think they were as high quality as the best bitcoin sportsbooks but I did say in the review that users funds were safe with them. Now we know they are not.\n\nI sought clarification and to get my funds back multiple times and was told I had gone against the affiliate terms and conditions without any specifics of what I had done that was against what term or condition. I could not see anything in those vague terms and conditions I had gone against so I asked again and was told.\n\n> You flat out call BitcoinRush.io one of the worst sites around, only catching any sense of traffic because we listed on Havelock? Calling us pretty much the worst bitcoin site in existence disqualifies you from any further affiliate payments.\n\nSo there it is, Bitcoin Rush stole my bitcoins from my account because they don't like what I said about them. I never called Bitcoin Rush one of the worst sites around, that is them exaggerating, and even if I had have done so that would not be against the terms and conditions. Even if I had have gone against the terms and condition nowhere do they say that gives Bitcoin Rush the right to take the cleared funds from previous deposits or affiliate payments out of my account.\n\nAs such Bitcoin Rush should no longer be trusted by the bitcoin community, [provably fair](http://www.bit88.co/provably-fair-gambling/) does not help much if they steal your bitcoin for reasons they make up as they go along. Luckily there is no reason to risk it as there are far higher quality, more professional and more trustworthy bitcoin sportsbooks and casinos [reviewed on Bitedge](http://www.bitedge.co/bitcoin-sportsbook-reviews/).\n\nFor those interested here is the full backstory of the disagreements leading up to the theft.\n\nhttp://www.bitedge.co/blog/bitcoin-rush-ripped-me-off-and-cannot-be-trusted/#backstory\n\n**Update**\nAfter I posted about this here and on [Bitcoin Talk Forum](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1134830) BitcoinRush defended their action and refused to pay me back.\n\nThey dishonestly labelled me as hostile, threatening, unreasonable, slanderous, childish, petty and immature. Most of what they said publicly was deliberately misleading, they understated the amount, they said it was after I stopped linking to them, they said I was an affiliate and not a player, all untrue.\n\nAfter they saw most community members disagreed with them they edited some of the above mentioned comments and paid me the amount owing.

The standard deviation is also 10 min, but the distribution is very asymmetric: it is far more likely that the next block will be solved in less than 5 minutes (P = ~40%) than that it will take more than 15 min (P =  ~22%).  \n\nYoy may want to say "the next block will arrive before 15 minutes with 77% probability, and before 20 minutes with 86% probability".\n\nThe time for the arrival of the second block is the the sum of two variables with exponential distribution.

Generally, the mean time for arrival of the Nth block is N T and the deviation is T sqrt(N).\n\nThe "10 minutes" is only the *nominal* value of T, because the difficulty is never properly tuned to the total hashpower.

If the Cowboys lose, the money will automatically be drawn from your account so long as you sent the funds and your friend agreed to the bet (as you told your program/code/contract). \n\nThe potential for this becomes really exciting when you look at the complexity of certain legal documents (e.g. Mortgage lending).

There are some similarities to Ethereum's [Schelling Point](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/03/28/schellingcoin-a-minimal-trust-universal-data-feed/) concept, though that one is a bit more clearly and simply explained as far as its technical implementation. A few issues I notice:\n\n* The nature of the data being polled by the oracle must be completely public and open to be weighed upon by the entire REP user base. For a prediction market, this is very much appropriate. For something else, say a business contract between two parties (e.g. deliver 100 widgets by next week for $1000) or anything involving any remotely sensitive information, this would likely not be. \n\n> Reputation will be worth a lot of money and thensystem makes it more profitable to be honest than dishonrst (oracles would have a lot to loose if they decide against the truth, and they can only succeed if they act all together that's why is important that the oracles are as many as possible and diverse). \n\n* What if financial incentive to lie/cheat is greater than that of the REP system rewards? For instance, I have a multibillion dollar smart contract for some sort of business deal. Things get sour. I publicly say screwit, anyone votes and show they have voted in my favor gets a $100K. Whereas the REP value system is funded by fees from the PM itself, oracle fees aren't going to pay anything close to that collusion reward.\n\n* I have yet to fully read up on the technical implementation for Augur, but it ultimately, these are systems that exist outside of bitcoin and the blockchain. As such, they exist as potential areas of failure or attack. Namely, some entity must exist to control key(s) to release funds. Can this entity suffer no risk of being hacked? Can it not be MITM'd and fed false REP vote data? An ethereum contract exists on-chain and suffers slightly fewer problems, as the Schellingcoin example is described.": 1, 'The whole way of getting smart contracts to work is an oracle, which is still a concept I have a tough time figuring out.  The oracle is what validates the condition that the contract has been fulfilled or not fulfilled.  But an oracle can be corrupted, right, just like anything else?\n\nSo you have a group of oracles that would arrive at consensus that a smart contract has been fulfilled.  The oracles are compensated for making the "right" decision.  Again, I don\'t know what is considered right and wrong.  But the oracles are compensated for voting in the correct way, thus they have financial incentive to be part of the ecosystem.\n\nThis was all verbally explained to me and I still have a tough time getting my head around it but oracles are kind of like miners and they need to be compensated somehow for rendering judgement.': 6, "If they manage to predict outcomes for sure they can confirm an event already happened.

Bitcoin's scripting language is fairly limited, not even Turing complete as Ethereum. Granted, it's designed that way. If you cannot have an bitcoin-native way to create trustless transactions dynamics based on external states without ultimately relying on an oracle, then as you say, it ends up as another potential attack surface.

The big danger in any sort of sharding approach is it massively increases vulnerability to sibyl attacks.": 6, "It's worthless at the moment. *Currently*, with pruning enabled, you cannot relay blocks, you cannot look up transactions, and you cannot use a wallet. \n\n------\n\n[0.11.0 Release Notes](https://bitcoin.org/en/release/v0.11.0):\n\n**Block file pruning**\n-----------------\n\nThis release supports running a fully validating node without maintaining a copy of the raw block and undo data on disk. To recap, there are four types of data related to the blockchain in the bitcoin system: the raw blocks as received over the network (blk???.dat), the undo data (rev???.dat), the block index and the UTXO set (both LevelDB databases). The databases are built from the raw data.\n\nBlock pruning allows Bitcoin Core to delete the raw block and undo data once it\xe2\x80\x99s been validated and used to build the databases. At that point, the raw data is used only to relay blocks to other nodes, to handle reorganizations, to look up old transactions (if -txindex is enabled or via the RPC/REST interfaces), or for rescanning the wallet. The block index continues to hold the metadata about all blocks in the blockchain.\n\nThe user specifies how much space to allot for block & undo files. The minimum allowed is 550MB. Note that this is in addition to whatever is required for the block index and UTXO databases. The minimum was chosen so that Bitcoin Core will be able to maintain at least 288 blocks on disk (two days worth of blocks at 10 minutes per block). In rare instances it is possible that the amount of space used will exceed the pruning target in order to keep the required last 288 blocks on disk.\n\nBlock pruning works during initial sync in the same way as during steady state, by deleting block files \xe2\x80\x9cas you go\xe2\x80\x9d whenever disk space is allocated. Thus, if the user specifies 550MB, once that level is reached the program will begin deleting the oldest block and undo files, while continuing to download the blockchain.\n\n**For now, block pruning disables block relay.** In the future, nodes with block pruning will at a minimum relay \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d blocks, meaning blocks that extend their active chain.\n\n**Block pruning is currently incompatible with running a wallet** due to the fact that block data is used for rescanning the wallet and importing keys or addresses (which require a rescan.) However, running the wallet with block pruning will be supported in the near future, subject to those limitations.\n\n**Block pruning is also incompatible with -txindex and will automatically disable it.**\n\n**Once you have pruned blocks, going back to unpruned state requires re-downloading the entire blockchain.** To do this, re-start the node with -reindex. Note also that any problem that would cause a user to reindex (e.g., disk corruption) will cause a pruned node to redownload the entire blockchain. Finally, note that when a pruned node reindexes, it will delete any blk???.dat and rev???.dat files in the data directory prior to restarting the download.\n\nTo enable block pruning on the command line:\n\n* `-prune=N`: where N is the number of MB to allot for raw block & undo data.\n\nModified RPC calls:\n\n* `getblockchaininfo` now includes whether we are in pruned mode or not.\n\n* `getblock` will check if the block\xe2\x80\x99s data has been pruned and if so, return an error.\n\n* `getrawtransaction` will no longer be able to locate a transaction that has a UTXO but where its block file has been pruned.\n\nPruning is disabled by default.": 9, "> Is it practical to circulate fraud proofs so that SPV miners can find out if a block is invalid?\n\nA compact fraud proofs are impossible, I think. You might devise a challenge-response protocol where miners will have to justify inclusion of certain transaction into a block by proving its dependencies exist.\n\nBut there is a lot of problematic aspects here, like what happens after fraud is proven? Are miners incentivized to reject fraud blocks? Is it possible that miners get into disagreement?\n\nYou need a consensus about fraud, so fraud proofs themselves need to get into a blockchain.\n\nI think that maybe with different block graph topologies such as treechains fraud proofs won't be necessary or will become simpler.": 1, '> Then we could make it so that a transaction in a group A can depend only on transactions in group A. This could work, but now you have problems with fragmentation of mining power, SPV and so on.\n\nIs it practical to circulate fraud proofs so that SPV miners can find out if a block is invalid? If you can do that then you could have miners doing normal mining on a single shard and SPV mining on all the other shards. The validity of transactions in any given block is secured by the ability of the network to invalidate the block via the fraud proof, and the ordering of the blocks is secure against attackers rewriting history because the whole network is working on it.': 1, 'What do you mean?': 1, 'Chain information cannot be split because nodes cannot guarantee that they will be available in the future. Redundancy cannot be made 100% safe. If some information is stored in only a handful of nodes and all these disappear, then the safety of the whole gets affected. You could think about increasing the redundancy requirement, like saying that every piece needs to be in 1/5 of the nodes, but nodes are anonymous to each other and they are not able to reliably coordinate (without trust) to such split.\n\nTherefore, the safe bet is that every node has everything. This way, even if your connectivity degrades to the point where it is just another node (e.g., a BitSat satellite), you can still validate the blocks and stay safe.\n\nThat said, there is something that nodes can do to avoid storing the full chain. After processing the blocks, they can *prune* them and just keep a list of coins left unspent. They are no longer *full nodes* as they cannot serve old transactions to others, but they still operate with full validation.': 2, "> Just reading up on this, the UTXO commitments stuff seems to do the trick, doesn't it?\n\nYes.\n\n> Why would the incentives be different if, instead of validating the block themselves and finding that it was bad, somebody else had sent them a fraud proof that showed them it was bad?\n\nOne thing is that they know for sure that all full nodes will reject blocks built on top of invalid ones, so they have an incentive to validate blocks ASAP.\n\nThat's not a certainty with a fraud proof model, unless probability of fraud proof propagating to all nodes before mined coins become mature is almost 1. Basically, if there is a chance that an exchange will accept fresh coins mined on top of a fraudulent block, there might be an incentive to keep mining.\n\nAnother difference is that now it takes about 10 seconds to validate a block, so it's unlikely that many blocks will be mined on top of an invalid one. Thus even if miner won't reject his own block, there won't be much damage as others will just orphan it.\n\nBut fraud proofs might take longer time to propagate/validate, so there is a possibility that many blocks will be mined on top of it.\n\n> Also, why would you need this extra consensus step? Surely the consensus is that once people realize a block is invalid, they stop mining on top of it, just as now?\n\nIf you assume that the majority of miners will get a fraud proof in a timely fashion then this extra step is not necessary. But can we just assume that?\n\nEffect of a network split on a Bitcoin network is well-understood: basically if several miners which represent a tiny fraction of all network are separated from the rest, it barely makes any difference.\n\nBut if we do sharding, if attacker manages to isolate nodes which could create and distribute fraud proofs, he will trick the majority of mining power to work on the fraudulent chain, and thus trick SPV clients into accepting his payments if fraud proofs are delayed for a significant time.\n\nThat's not to say we need an extra step for sure, but there are more potential attacks in this model, and they need to be addressed.\n": 1, 'the smartphone is like a billion times more powerful than the computers we used to go to the moon.': 1, 'Sure, but storage is *not* a bottleneck right now.

This trust can be mitigated, but it does open up things for theoretical attacks.\n\nAs long as we don't bloat the blockchain there's little need for this anytime soon. 40Gb shouldn't be that much of a concern for modern day computers, and should be easy to keep up with increasing cheaper $/Gb drives.\n\nThere might be a time where we need this, but it's far from due.": 19, 'Do you know of a FAQ on how to run a pruned node? Thanks.': 2, "Pruning does not affect security. At all. You still have a complete UTXO set, which is necessary to verify transactions. The only thing pruning affects is that _other nodes_  won't be able to get historic blocks from you.\n\nStill in theory it is possible that each pruning node will host a small fraction of all blocks and new nodes will be able to bootstrap from partially-pruned nodes.\n\nPruning affects only storage, it doesn't solve the scalability problem: you still have to download the whole blockchain, you still have to store complete UTXO set, you still have to process every transaction ever.\n\nSharding is something entirely different, it would drastically affect security model, but also can _potentially_ result in higher scalability.\n\nAnd then there are SPV clients.\n\nSo again, pruning, sharding and SPV are three different things. With pruning you still don't need to trust anybody, but it solves only a part of the problem.\n\n": 2, 'Then please tell us about a non residential perspective where businesses get drastic bandwidth advantages.': 1, 'yes, possible. split blockchain into 100, store into bitcoin nodes with 10x redundancy. now we have a chain as small as tenth the size of original chain.': 2, 'Pruning is very different from splitting the blockchain.': 3, 'What if pruning still kept a random 5% of full blocks per node so that the entire chain could be constructed from a distributed network of pruned nodes?': 2, 'I have been asking myself the same question for a long time now.': 1, 'Yes this is what I propose in my subchains idea (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1083345.0).

This creates the right environment for miner decentralization and decentralization of the access to transactions in general.': 1, "Indeed. I was just pointing out the 'smaller blockchain storage'- type deal  already exists.\n\nAnd in a sense it is the same, but instead of trusting your own validations you're trusting other peoples validations (and the connection you have with those people, etc.).

Everyone else only needs *hashes* of this data, to verify that the original data has not been altered.

Lets say you developed a Photoshop clone for Linux.  Instead of charging the users the cost of photoshop up front, you could charge a microtransaction for the user to save their work. People don\'t like the idea of spending as much as they do on Photoshop up front, but they might be fine spending 5 cents worth in a microtransaction to get whatever job they need done.  In the aggregate a developer might do better this way independently than relying on being employed by X corporation.  \n\nLets say you develop some sort of manner to verify proof of remote data storage.
