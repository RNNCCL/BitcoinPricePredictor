It basically converts a block announcement "Block with transaction A, B, C and nonce" to "Block with transaction HASH A, B, C and nonce".  Because clients most likely have already received transaction A, B, C so no need to send them again.  Any client can do this conversion and forward the more succinct representation to other clients that support this format.  \n\nAnd also I\'m skipping lots of detail, for example a client who requests a thin block can pass a Bloom filter saying "these are the transactions I know about, so give me only hashes if the transaction matches, otherwise give me the full transaction."

Let these apps have room to grow and if they choose to use side chains in the future because it\'s economical they will. The only reason any of these apps choose to use Bitcoin over Ethereum is because Bitcoin\'s first mover advantage that gives added branding, users, and blockchain stability, not because it\'s a easier platform to develop on at this point.': 1, 'Downloading apps is such a huge issue': 1, 'OB is free to use, you pay no fee for selling stuff, eBay charges around 10% if i am right.': 3, "Not sad at all.

For example, Tor [can't protect your anonymity when torrenting files](https://blog.torproject.org/blog/bittorrent-over-tor-isnt-good-idea). This is highly relevant for OB since its marketplace listings are persisted over a DHT.\n\nSince Tor doesn't support UDP connections, it isn't clear how OB could work with Tor. To the extent it can be made to work without UDP, it will just end up being rewritten from scratch. To the extent DNM vendors can play risky games to make it work with convuluted anonymous VPNs and hosting, none of those hosting providers are going to willingly support DNM use cases as their TOS calls out illegal items specifically and in 100% of cases.\n\nAnd let's be honest: to the extent OB can be rewritten with Tor usage in mind, and by the look of OB's current codebase, you're going to be better off rewriting the entire thing over again from scratch. Maybe someone can make it work over I2P, but then you don't have something that works with Tor browser which is a whole 'nother barrier to adoption even in a DNM context\n\nTLDR; Yes. It truly *does* matter if your application isn't designed for Tor.\n\n> Tor is essentially a fancy VPN.\n\nEdward Snowden recommends Tor browser, and he isn't saying that for no reason. Tor is *far superior* to any VPN. Tor is free. Tor is [easy](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en). Tor provides clearly superior anonymity through onion routing. And whatever security concerns you might have with Tor can be significantly mitigated by disabling javascript and only browsing HTTPS sites, easy as pie.\n\nFor all but the most specific use cases that aren't supported by Tor, Tor is vastly, *vastly* superior.\n\nI have to say, the people who forego the use of Tor, instead rationalizing that it's somehow better to pay out for a VPN service are just *wrong*. Please don't use a VPN. Tor is cost-free and superior to a VPN virtually all of the time unless you have a very specific use case in mind that Tor doesn't work with. For everything else Tor is simply *better*.\n\n> I bet there will be drug markets operating on OpenBazaar within a year of it's official launch.\n\nI'm sure some vendors with a very high tolerance for risk will push the easy button, but it still isn't clear how buyers would buy from those vendors anonymously considering the marketplace listings can't be accessed over Tor. AFAIK the best you can do without rewriting OB's codebase is to proxy marketplace listings from an unscrupulous hosting provider.\n\n> The other thing that could be possible is a separate OB network within the dark web.\n\nMaybe it can work over I2P.

But, OpenBazaar is a lot more "ambitious" (stupid?) than that.\n\n**IMO** - OpenBazaar is competing on two fronts.\n\n1) To be your browser.\nAgainst: Google Chrome, IE, Firefox, and Safari.\n\n2) To be your search engine.\nAgainst: Google, Yahoo, Bing.\n\nUnfortunately, OpenBazaar doesn\'t know this.

There\'s not enough magical thinking in the world for me to believe that they will succeed at that task with no budget -- even if the developers disappear.\n\n**IMO** - You need a compelling reason to use a specialized browser and niche search engines. BitTorrent is a great example where it works, but the compelling reason is obviously that you can get free content that you can\'t get for free anywhere else.\n\nWill *you* be selling products for free on OpenBazaar?\n\n**IMO** - The fact that there are no listing/success fees is not that compelling to me. Because fees are just one cost, and they\'re often the smallest of all costs anyways.\n\nIt\'s free to list my products for sale on PasteBin.com, but I don\'t do that because there are no customers there. It would be an opportunity cost to waste my time promoting my wares somewhere customers were not.\n\nI\'m WILLING to pay to get customers. All businesses are.

It\'s going to look like you shut down your website, or that you went out of business, or that you were hacked.\n\n**IMO** - SALES create "word of mouth" marketing. You don\'t start from there.

I think if you did, you wouldn\'t be discussing this topic with the wild *theories* you are propsing.\n\nhttp://www.multpl.com/inflation/table\n\nTake a look. \n\n>Are you not able to imagine a world where a Big Mac combo costing +$50?\n\nThe fact that you used "Big Mac Combo" as your example makes me think you are...well...very young. Why not use milk or bread as the historical examples? Why not discuss the CPI, which is the measurement that you are so vaguely referring to?\n\nIf the question is, do I see the CPI changing so drastically, despite all evidence to the contrary, that in my lifetime I will see a 1000% increase to the CPI?\n\nThe answer is absolutely not. \nhttp://www.usinflationcalculator.com/inflation/consumer-price-index-and-annual-percent-changes-from-1913-to-2008/\n\nThat chart shows you the last 100 years of recorded CPI. Pay special attention to the great depression (1929-1939). The great depression. If you look at our Great Recession of 2008, you can see we only shed a max of 50% of our market before bouncing back and stabilizing.\n\nhttp://www.chartoftheday.com/20101222.gif\n\nUnlike the Great Depression, which shed nearly 80% of the value, retracting, before it bounced back. \n\nSo if you use the great depression as a measuring stick, of just how fucked things can get (losing 80% of your market is extreme extreme situation. Banking collapse, market collapse, etc). \n\nHopefully you are following me. Now compare the CPI. Look especially at 1929-1932 ...\n\n-6.4, -9.3, -10.3\n\nThen the market picked back up in 32, and you can see the CPI stabalized back into the positive, 1933 being 0.8, then 1934 1.5, then 3.0, then 1.4, then 2.9 ....meaning that if milk was $1.00, in 1930 it would be 1.06, then $1.15 in 1931, then $1.25 in 1932. \n\nBy 1937 it was back down to roughly $1.15 again. Yet at that point the S&P had only rebounded back to 50% of the peak of the bubble. The market lost 50% of its value, and milk only rose 15%\n\nYou see the pattern here? Market plummets, CPI sheds no more than 30% in what was a HORRIFIC market crash. 80% of the market drops, we only have to pay 15% more for eggs.\n\nNow, tell me all about this wild theory of $50 Big Mac combo\'s. What data do you have to backup such a wild claim? Because history, even at its worst, has shown the USA to be *extremely resilient*, for the people to not bear hyper-inflation, unlike nazi Germany, or Zimbabwe, or Venezuela.\n\nEconomics is not a small pie. Its a gigantic piece, and you really need to study how it works before coming up with these idea\'s and throwing them out on the internet. You need to read, a lot.

Validationless mining is actually helping an attacker get a longer chain. By stopping at least you're not actively helping (only passively not working against the attacker).\n\nI'm pretty sure that's not correct.  In every attack vector, validationless mining is at worst equivalent to not mining.  For example, let's say an attacker produces an invalid block.  He then keeps mining for valid blocks while everybody else mines for that invalid block.  Well, he still has to produce a proof of work for the block he's working on now.  The mining doesn't get easier because he's the only one working on it.  And at least with validationless mining, the difficulty is higher.

Especially if another miner builds another empty block on it.\n\n3) the attacker can at will send that last byte and have everyone validate his block + the chain behind it. Remember the block doesn't even need to be invalid for it to be an attack.\n\nWhat the attacker gained here is that part of the hashing power (the honest part) was wasting their time. So the attacker was able to partition the network on different chains and any hashing power wasted by others means more profit for the attacker (and whoever followed him).": 2, "Validationless mining also builds on top of invalid blocks (we've seen that happen already) which makes the network super insecure: losing your money even after 6 confirmations.

So maybe we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised that politicians and central bankers are now waging a war on cash. That\xe2\x80\x99s right, policy makers in Europe and the U.S. want to make it harder for the hoi polloi to hold actual currency.\n\nMario Draghi fired the latest salvo on Monday when he said the European Central Bank would like to ban \xe2\x82\xac500 notes. A day later Harvard economist and Democratic Party favorite Larry Summers declared that it\xe2\x80\x99s time to kill the $100 bill, which would mean goodbye to Ben Franklin. Alexander Hamilton may soon\xe2\x80\x94and shamefully\xe2\x80\x94be replaced on the $10 bill, but at least the 10-spots would exist for a while longer. Ol\xe2\x80\x99 Ben would be banished from the currency the way dead white males like him are banned from the history books.\n\nLimits on cash transactions have been spreading in Europe since the 2008 financial panic, ostensibly to crack down on crime and tax avoidance. Italy has made it illegal to pay cash for anything worth more than \xe2\x82\xac1,000 ($1,116), while France cut its limit to \xe2\x82\xac1,000 from \xe2\x82\xac3,000 last year. British merchants accepting more than \xe2\x82\xac15,000 in cash per transaction must first register with the tax authorities. Fines for violators can run into the thousands of euros. Germany\xe2\x80\x99s Deputy Finance Minister Michael Meister recently proposed a \xe2\x82\xac5,000 cap on cash transactions. Deutsche Bank CEO John Cryan predicted last month that cash won\xe2\x80\x99t survive another decade.\n\nThe enemies of cash claim that only crooks and cranks need large-denomination bills. They want large transactions to be made electronically so government can follow them. Yet these are some of the same European politicians who blew a gasket when they learned that U.S. counterterrorist officials were monitoring money through the Swift global system. Criminals will find a way, large bills or not.\n\nThe real reason the war on cash is gearing up now is political: Politicians and central bankers fear that holders of currency could undermine their brave new monetary world of negative interest rates. Japan and Europe are already deep into negative territory, and U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen said last week the U.S. should be prepared for the possibility. Translation: That\xe2\x80\x99s where the Fed is going in the next recession.\n\nNegative rates are a tax on deposits with banks, with the goal of prodding depositors to remove their cash and spend it to increase economic demand. But that goal will be undermined if citizens hoard cash. And hoarding cash is easier if you can take your deposits out in large-denomination bills you can stick in a safe. It\xe2\x80\x99s harder to keep cash if you can only hold small bills.\n\nSo, presto, ban cash. This theme has been pushed by the likes of Bank of England chief economist Andrew Haldane and Harvard\xe2\x80\x99s Kenneth Rogoff, who wrote in the Financial Times that eliminating paper currency would be \xe2\x80\x9cby far the simplest\xe2\x80\x9d way to \xe2\x80\x9cget around\xe2\x80\x9d the zero interest-rate bound \xe2\x80\x9cthat has handcuffed central banks since the financial crisis.\xe2\x80\x9d If the benighted peasants won\xe2\x80\x99t spend on their own, well, make it that much harder for them to save money even in their own mattresses.\n\nAll of which ignores the virtues of cash for law-abiding citizens. Cash allows legitimate transactions to be executed quickly, without either party paying fees to a bank or credit-card processor. Cash also lets millions of low-income people participate in the economy without maintaining a bank account, the costs of which are mounting as post-2008 regulations drop the ax on fee-free retail banking. While there\xe2\x80\x99s always a risk of being mugged on the way to the store, digital transactions are subject to hacking and computer theft.\n\nCash is also the currency of gray markets\xe2\x80\x94amounting to 20% or more of gross domestic product in some European countries\xe2\x80\x94that governments would love to tax. But the reason gray markets exist is because high taxes and regulatory costs drive otherwise honest businesses off the books. Politicians may want to think twice about cracking down on the cash economy in a way that might destroy businesses and add millions to the jobless rolls. The Italian economy might shut down without cash.\n\nBy all means people should be able to go cashless if they like. But it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to avoid the conclusion that the politicians want to bar cash as one more infringement on economic liberty. They may go after the big bills now, but does anyone think they\xe2\x80\x99d stop there? Why wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t they eventually ban all cash transactions much as they banned gold and silver as mediums of exchange?\n\nBeware politicians trying to limit the ways you can conduct private economic business.

The protocol works by keeping track of atomically spendable coins, transactions in blocks select and consume previously existing coins and create new coins.  In Bitcoin Core new blocks are validated against a separate database of coins that the node maintains, not against the history. The only time the blocks are accessed is to help new peers synchronize (and, near the tip of the chain, to perform chain reorganizations). \n\nThe wallet in Bitcoin Core keeps its own copy of any transactions involving it; so pruning doesn't come into play at all-- except in advanced operations like importing a key from another wallet.

For a given block, instead of sending the same data twice, you send it once (plus some hopefully small additional data that lets you reconstruct). These techniques do not improve the efficiency of loose transaction relay.\n\nTthe relay of loose transactions is much less efficient than "send it once" to begin with because the INV messages which are sent/received from every peer for every transaction are only 1/10th the size of the transactions themselves. (INV messages are how peers avoid sending/receiving every transaction to every peer-- but the INV process only reduces bandwidth by a constant factor).\n\nFor blocks, the INV process is much more efficient since the INV is orders of magnitude smaller than a block (in whole or efficient form) and there aren\'t many block INVs (144/day targeted). Because of this considerably more of a nodes bandwidth is used on transaction relay rather than blocks and as a result any improvement in block relay is diminished by this ratio ([Amdahl\'s law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amdahl\'s_law)). \n': 5, "Have you considered that a SegWit soft fork requires miners to upgrade in unison?\n\nDo you know what happens if they don't?

One thing is that you could have better selection; so many sellers are turned off to eBay after a few bad experiences.  It's really hard for casual sellers of actual used goods to be successful.  So, if they turn up on OB, that could be big.  The other thing would be if the seller passed on some savings and listed lower prices.\n\n____\n\nIn the end, OB has two major hurdles to overcome:\n\n* It has to actually attract users.
