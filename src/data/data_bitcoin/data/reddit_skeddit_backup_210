He received the paper, and then publicly tweeted about it. At that point, perhaps by accident, RootStock was forced out of stealth mode and began speaking publicly.\n\nAs for 'distribution still fair', you know it isn't :). The situation can be massaged to make it *seem* fair by relying on bitcoin's fair distribution, but when you have something like 80% of ether distribution occurring in a one-off pre-sale open for 1 month or so, then that's just absurd. I personally think this single decision dooms the ability of ether to be a legit currency. It simply can't be rationalized. At some point, if these things become 'bigger', they have to be rationalized to the public. Bitcoin can be rationalized, since it started off publicly available in a free-market from $0 and has been available in that same manner for 7 years. Ether? No way. Be honest...\n\nAgain, this is worsened because 80% of supply was in that pre-sale. And, this is further compounded by the impending decision to switch from PoW to PoS (so that those 80% pre-salers can become even richer via PoS) and rapidly reduce increase in supply.\n\nI don't want to say it, but it's almost as scammy as Dash (75% of its current supply was pre-mined), except Ethereum is partially redeemed because of the illustrious history of its founder (Vitalik) and the good faith accorded to him. If Vitalik wasn't part of the project, I think Ethereum would be worth ~$0.": 1, 'Interesting, does / will RootStock suffer from similar limitations do you think?

Ethereum has a larger value proposition with existing infrastructure and is highly more transformative technology. I also think there's still too much stigma as well surrounding Bitcoin for these enterprises to choose the bitcoin sidechain. I love bitcoin, but am sobering up to the reality that they are going to choose the pure Ethereum private and public blockchain implementation for in-house development and deployment.": 1, 'Sidechains: They have replied that they intend to use a federated peg to start off with and then mount the flying unicorn (IE, something like what blockstream is reportedly developing). \n\nMiner incentive is fees on the side-chain. These will be high if Rootstock can leverage Bitcoins current network effects.\n\nOrphan blocks are resolved using Ethereum\'s Uncle resolution mechanisms. \n\nEthereum is non-SHA256 and has a mining pool larger than what botnets can attack. It\'s as safe Bitcoin for all intents and purposes, because attacking it at this point creates more incentives to just look after it. When this shifts to CASPER (their PoS algo which solves "nothing-at-stake"), security will be based on betting that a certain tx set will reach consensus, and losing a portion of your stake if you bet on a non-winner. Basically it takes the investment behind mining and makes it direct instead of indirect. Secure? Probably more than it needs to be.\n\nWhichever sufficiently flexible smart-contract system has network effects first will win, and everyone will mine there. Right now Rootstock is betting that they can get to that point before Ethereum does, Ethereum has already bet that they can get there before any Bitcoin sidechains that have their base functionality can. \n\nYou are right, they are evasive, at least at the moment. I suspect this is because of the criticisms regarding their mention of federated pegging. They\'ve stated they will release their design (white paper) at the Mexico Bitcoin conf and that they\'ve "sent copies to prominent Bitcoin community members including Nick Szabo". Mailing Nick my rocket ship blueprints doesn\'t make me SpaceX though, but who knows, maybe they have something. \n\nSidechains would be used to leverage the network effects of Bitcoin. Sidechains would also have network effects, the most useful one will probably see 80% of the activity. \n\nShapeshift is convenient, but it\'s not as cool as a sidechain would be.\n\nBottom line; if Rootstock succeeds, the Ethereum chain withers and dies, and the devs join Rootstock dev. If Ethereum wins, Bitcoin withers and dies due to lack of features.

Think what\'s happening now in the property markets (in both rent and house prices) in NY, San Fran, London, Hong Kong, Sydney etc. and then scale that by a sizeable magnitude (as there\'s a huge compounding difference between 0% interest and -6% interest).\n\nImagine a scenario of a handful of giant conglomerates buying (as a bad example) the entirety of NY\'s property market (at -6% interest rate) and then they have cash incoming from the rent every month; they\'re going to have to immediately reinvest it into something otherwise they\'ll face negative compounding from savings so asset prices will be pushed further and further into the stratosphere.\n\nIf this happens, I don\'t know how the gen.pop. can survive and am surprised they are even at current levels.

I saved $0.50 on a single cup of coffe, almost completely covering the "cost" of changing my dollars in to bitcoin.\n\nAnd the great thing, you don\'t have to buy a full bitcoin, so if you have say, a coffee budget of 20 dollars a month or whatever, you can buy 20 dollars worth of bitcoin, and get more coffee than you could before....or any other product that offered a discount.': 3, "isn't the idea of purse sort of unsustainable? Sure there are a bunch of unused amazon gift cards out there. But once those are bought up won't the market keep shrinking, effectively making the % you will be saving less and less?": 1, "Yeah. Discounts can be the killer app of bitcoin.\n\nI can't wait for *everything* to have a purse-like interface, where you can buy anything in the world at a big discount for bitcoin. I mean, we can already buy takeout, hotels, airfare, movie tickets etc. for bitcoin, but imagine getting all those things and more at a 25% discount using bitcoin.   Epic win.": 12, 'https://medium.com/purse-essays/10-use-cases-for-bitcoin-c6b7182aa1b9 This gets you started on the many legitimate reason "earners" have for using Purse to get bitcoins.': 3, 'What does "0/1" mean?': 2, "Exactly. Adoption will not be instant, but if it's cheaper (which it should be), then over time this should help. Coupon-clippers really should get on board. ": 11, 'Then how *does* it work? Why do people buy stuff on an Amazon wish list for $400 USD to get 1BTC instead of buying from Circle or Coinbase to get the same thing for $320 USD?\n\n': 4, 'No need for apologies!': 1, 'What problems did you run into?': 1, "> I have been a Amazon member since 2008, I would not risk my account to save 15%.\n\nAmazon has no idea that you are using Purse. All that they see is someone using some other account is shipping a gift to your address. Your account isn't involved at all. Hell, you don't even have to HAVE an Amazon account to use Purse.\n\n": 1, "Amazon gift cards can buy over 200 million products. It's hard to believe that a large number of honest people think trading them for overpriced bitcoins is a good idea.\n\n": -6, "Yeah, that's what I assumed.": 2, 'I live in Germany and use it mostly for smallish items on amazon.co.uk. works great.': 1, 'I never buy a Starbucks anymore without a 20% discount. ': 2, 'I placed a ~$25 order at 15% off. It got picked up by a new buyer within 10 minutes. It was two-day guaranteed shipping.\n\n5/6 days later I still have no package, and I ask support if the buyer has the tracking info (the tracking info **really** should be given to the [btc] seller by default). No response. The next day the entire order was canceled and the wish list emptied.\n\nI assume it was an attempt at fraud, but the support wasn\'t helpful in that regard either.
