I think it leaves out the tricky question of miner attacks made possible without any cap, but it was overall very well-done.\n\nThe talk also introduces a useful conceptual model. Miners produce two things. First, they produce nonces, which everyone knows about.

Historically, Luke Jr. tried to implement "coinvalidation" on the lesser-used linux library repos that he was building, so he could filter out all of Eric Vorhees\' transactions and call them "spam". The more interesting issue for me is what happens when the block reward is so low and the blocksize so large that there is incentive for the miners to actually start collaborating to self-impose a smaller blocksize limit in order to drive users to pay higher fees to get their tx into the next block. Also, I do think the statistics of real-time network propogation will play a role, but only in the sense that it will limit how big miners will be willing to make their blocks, risking "staleness" that it could take too long to propogate before a new empty block could be found and enter a race condition for validity. Also, the mempool has issues that need to be addressed, so that\'s where these "spammy/ddos" transactions really start to hurt the network.

The main problem, however, is that miners does not behave rationally - i.e. they include 0-fee transactions in blocks and transactions with too low a fee - perhaps we just need proper optimal fee computations in the standard client, which I think most miners use anyway.\n\n": 1, "When fees decrease, transaction volumes will increase, when all other things are held equal.

": 14, "I presume you're talking about an attack where there are only a small number of nodes which as a group become susceptible to government regulation, address blacklisting, etc. In that case, transactions are restricted and demand for blockspace goes down, meaning the equilibrium blocksize goes down, and it becomes cheaper for more people to run nodes, so the network rebalances itself.

In this case, Peter claims as fees decrease, more data **will be written** to the blockchain as if that's a law of nature. Baloney. This is false even for Bitcoin, and it's **definitely, unquestionably false** for altcoins. There are three reasons for this:\n\n1. Absent network effect of a blockchain, miners and hence users have no incentive to encode data in that blockchain because there's no guarantee the data will be around or useful to other people\n2. Unless you have a hot wallet specifically reserved for quickly and by extension insecurely making full blockchain writes with MINIMAL effort, you need to crack open your cold storage to do anything on the bitcoin blockchain. The costs here are intangible and have to do with time, effort and knowing your cold storage is being put at elevated risk compared to if you hadn't touched it or cracked it open\n3. Absent decentralization, you are writing not to a permissionless blockchain but to a *permissioned*, centralized one like Ripple, and who wants to do that?! If I told you that you could write all the data you want for free to a permissioned ledger, would you even care? No, you wouldn't care because it would be utterly and entirely pointless.": 1, 'Good stuff :)': 3, 'I don\'t see much evidence to support your argument. Bitcoin has been becoming more centralized for years, yet we haven\'t seen any mass exodus to altcoins. Adoption has increased, if anything. The network effect seems plenty powerful enough to override any "natural" economic incentive towards decentralization.\n\nI think it\'s much more likely that under an approach like Peter R.\'s, decentralization will continue to erode, and by the time someone exploits that to attack or control the network people will be sitting around like boiled frogs wondering what happened, and it will be too late to do anything about it.': -1, 'Yes it was a mix of: economics 101, oh look supply / demand exists, oh look orphan risk exists, handwaving, ignore anything except miners, appeal to populism (censorship, DDOS...we must be the good guys, and here is a graph showing XT at 15% - the highest it ever got, when somebody was running some faked nodes and admitted to it).

': 1, '> when all other things are held equal\n\nSuch as your coin morphing into Ripple for instance? At which point writing to that permissioned blockchain becomes utterly and entirely pointless no matter how low the fee is.': 1, "Wow at first I was going to comment on the large number of logical fails in the presentation but then I watched to the end and realized that the whole thing was just standard XT complaining... It's ironic that the founder of a peer-review journal has such a low level of scientific quality. ": -2, 'This will never be the case as since altcoins exist we have a multi dimensional competing free market.

It could lead to only a few large actors (like governments or corporations beholden to governments) being capable of running nodes allowing them to blacklist and control the flow of all transactions.\n\nI believe that this is an unproven assertion, a 'slippery slope'.  There are a wide array of political and corporate alliances within bitcoin and the viewpoints of some are contradictory to each other.  The likelihood that 100% of the network would collaborate on a blacklist seems unlikely given this -how should I say, *geopolitical* distribution of miners.\n\nOk, off to read your linked article.\n\n": 4, 'A bit more than that:\n\nhttps://getaddr.bitnodes.io/nodes/?q=Bitcoin%20XT': 1, "I don't think my talk made my opinion on the matter completely clear: a block size limit is OK IMO so long as it is (far) to the right of Q*.

Its a huge efford to move (masses) away from fiat to bitcoin but once we are in the world of cryptocurrencies switching gets way easier.. see e.g. shapeshift and how it enables everyone who accepts bitcoin by simply using their api to accept all kinds of crypto currencies which get on the fly converted to the currency of choice. and i think this is just the beginning.

The economic impact of such a scenario (extreme devaluation of bitcoin; mass flight to altcoin) would be so severe that people may be dissuaded even if there is observable centralization in the network.\n\nContinuity is a strong force here, and most rational actors would continue to value the dominant currency (because everyone else will too) if only because there is no *exact* threshold where centralization has gone too far.

This is the most important objection to his (in my opinion impressive) paper, making it, frankly, infeasible.

I would much rather they use constant-time block propagation technologies to minimize orphans than resort to SPV mining.\n\nThere was another talk about doing this, but *without* explicitly organized similar mempool policies by Rusty Russel:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/mhAsnzidtZ8?t=3152": 2, "If we start **really** running into the block size limit, this very well may change.
