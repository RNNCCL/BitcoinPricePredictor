Facilities of this size may be able to mine without a pool, or choosing pool servers that are well-balanced for hashrate. This industry may see regulation beyond basic taxation (such as KYC), but many already sell coins directly to bitcoin exchanges.

This can significantly reduce the need for private centralized networks like the Miner Relay Network in keeping the miners competitive with each other despite variable internet connection speeds.\n\n\n**Blocktorrent**\n\nOne of the biggest pains in running a full node is the 5-7 days it takes to download the block chain from the network. Created by Jon Toomim, Blocktorrent is a method to speed up the initial block download times and reliability by using DHT techniques similar to those used in BitTorrent.\n\n\n**Transaction Validation scaling**\n\nInformation on any ongoing efforts to parallelize transaction validation (across CPUs) to improve throughput & reduce validation latency.\n\n\n**Datastream Compression**\n\nBandwidth is an issue for users that run nodes in regions where bandwidth is expensive and subject to caps, in addition network latency in some regions can also be quite high.

Considering there\'s always going to be some small cost to bandwidth and storage, it seems obvious that (small) * (unlimited) equals (a shitload of money), for ALL nodes on the network. That doesn\'t sound so great. \n\nAlso what more can you as a normal user do with "unlimited" instead of a "big enough" X? Upload your baby home videos? Star Wars Bluerays? Backup your whole PC? Why?\n\nWhether possible or not, unlimited seems pretty pointless tbh. As far as I know "unlimited" is not possible yet in a "SAFE and workable" manner and likely never will be. Aiming for "big enough" sounds a lot smarter. Whether that is doable in a "SAFE and workable" manner remains to be seen, but I\'d say that\'s everyone\'s goal.\n\nSo why one layer? To start with: let\'s say your neighbour does like Lightning Network and because he uses it a lot, he hardly makes any layer 1 transactions anymore. That means you now have extra space for your transactions that wasn\'t there before and you don\'t have to give up anything or do anything different. So even if you don\'t want to use extra layers, you sure as hell do want the extra space, so you better encourage everyone else to do use those other layers.\n\nThe next thing is considering that each off-chain tech will be different. Some you may not like, some you may like, some you may like only under certain circumstances. It would be stupid to dismiss them all (even before they\'re invented).\n\nThen more specifically Lightning Network.\n\nThink for a second about the reason Bitcoin has a blockchain to begin with: The only reason(**) Bitcoin needs a blockchain at all is to prevent people from cheating each other by double spending. Remember that other ways of cheating (malleability) will have been solved by SegWit soon or are simply impossible thanks to cryptography. If users were somehow prevented from double spending, we wouldn\'t need blockchains at all. No blocks (no blocksize debate) and no chain (no on/off-chain debate). People can just hand each other transactions directly, no need to even broadcast them to the whole world (so no bandwidth problems). Everyone just keeps any transactions they receive in their own wallet (no global storage problem) and creates new transactions out of those, giving them to the next party (in zero confirmation time!).\n\nWow, all 5 big problems that Bitcoin has: just gone. And all that still without middlemen!\n\nYou can have the above under that one condition: users must be blocked from double spending. In fact the above quite nicely describes current Bitcoin and the way double-spends are prevented is by putting them in chained blocks (causing those 5 "problems"). But what if you could create a safe environment where the non-double-spend can be guaranteed in another way?\n\nBitcoin is programmable money! The domain is a bit limited, a script lives in a pretty tight virtual space after all, but that space does (since recently) include a time dimension: for example, a coin can be placed somewhere with a guarantee that it can\'t be moved until a certain time has passed, unless some other conditions are met (2-of-2 signatures)... "can\'t be moved"! Can\'t be double-spend...\n\nThat\'s exactly what we needed above! (***)\n\nThis not only shows that LN makes a shitton of sense in the first place. It also shows that LN transactions really are just Bitcoin transactions, merely not stored on the blockchain. LN creates a safe environment (albeit smaller and shorter in duration) than what Bitcoin itself covers and allow blockchainless Bitcoin transactions to take place within that environment.\n\n*) Any promises and errors herein are mine and mine alone. I\'m a nobody. Don\'t blame the devs if they don\'t make it in time.\n\n**) Yes, the public blockchain has a few other uses, but when focusing only on relatively short-term payment functions of Bitcoin, the above holds nicely. For example ignoring initial coin distribution.\n\n***) I\'m skipping some nasty details on exactly how to setup such unmovable coins between two parties. Those details make the safe environment smaller again, but nonetheless still large enough to be of use.': 1, "It's a step in the right direction.

Fascism was first looked upon positively by the Western powers as a bulwark against Socialism/Communism, but in the mid-thirties when the revolutionary and aggressive nature of Fascism became apparent -- it obviously became threatening. As for your quotes from Hitler and their party plank, I would just point out that basically fascism in Europe, whether the Nazis or the Dreyfusards/Action Francaise, were basically the rabble-rousers/gutter-snipes/mob, who got the support of the military/industrial/finanacial elites -- after the greater mass of Europeans had been calling for economic redistribution for 50+ years. People get tired being stymied by Parliament; Socialism had been outlawed in Germany for 20/30 years, though most of the workers held it in faith. That is why they had WWI: because everyone at the turn of the century saw how the machine could free people from stupid drudgery and while individual differences might exist, people could materially be equal. That is dangerous to a hierarchical society, and so the that dream had to be dashed. Of course, the Nazis sold themselves to the people as socialists, but they weren\'t. Plan and simple. When they say "we" in the party planks, they are referring to the German nation, not the individual.

Lol \n\n': 5, 'Maybe there is a problem with atomic cross chain swap, I am not familiar with that and it might be something different I have in mind.\n\nAs I understand payment channels, they are trustless, decentralized and can be applied to any blockchain. \nIf I structure a transaction cross blockchains with a counterparty into very small steps, then the whole transaction process becomes essentially trustless (if I can tolerate a very small risk). E.g., I could structure a transaction worth $10.000 into negligible amounts, then start transacting "penny for penny" with my counterparty. Then the risk both sides take is probably way less than overall transaction costs (opening an closing of payment channels on both blockchains - a cost risk that I take anyway). ': 1, 'Atomic cross-chain trading works its just that it doesn\'t work very well for trading every cryptocurrency because:\n\n1. Not all cryptocurrencies have OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY support (required for fail-safe refunds after both sides deposit into a multi-sig) and\n\n2. Not all blockchains support non-standard transactions (meaning you won\'t be able to confirm your smart contract TXs which could delay the trade indefinitely) and\n\n3. Not all cryptocurrencies are anything like Bitcoin (so the algorithm won\'t work on all of them.)\n\n4. These contracts aren\'t enforcible so anyone can waste anyone else\'s time and make trades that they don\'t follow through with. This makes it very hard to estimate prices in order books and do anything you would typically associate with an \xe2\x80\x9cexchange\xe2\x80\x9d (most smart contracts currently suffer from this and if they don\'t they\'re probably using oracles.)\n\n5. Bonus section: its hard to start an exchange without liquidity, good UX design, and money for marketing. An exchange is a serious venture that needs proper funding and so far there has been no one willing to fund a serious FinTech startup for cryptocurrencies.\n\nI was probably the first person to implement atomic-cross chain trading and had a working prototype as early as 2013 but due to these problems I ended up switching to micro-payment channels since it doesn\'t need non-standard transaction to run. Unfortunately, micro-payment channels still don\'t solve the refund problem which is why I wrote about using "timechains" / time-lock encryption to do refunds with time-locked ECDSA keys. \n\nTimechains allow you to encrypt information and have the plaintexts released at arbitrary points in the future without the need for a third-party to play any role. So you could use timechains to create a chain of time-lock encrypted ECDSA private keys and then use them directly in smart contracts and a third-party wouldn\'t be needed to hold any keys. But I now believe my particular implementation of time-lock encryption is less than ideal because there doesn\'t seem to be a good way to ensure that the timechain is always broken at an optimal rate (even using incentives) \xe2\x80\x93 a problem that can lead to \xe2\x80\x9cclock skew.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThere\'s been some recent developments in improving time-lock encryption using the Bitcoin blockchain + witness encryption but I\'m not sure how practical that is for smart contracts. I think future smart contracts will use something completely different but I won\'t reveal yet exactly what that is ;)\n\nRegarding a P2P ShapeShift: there\'s no exchanges yet that are 100% trustless. Mercury uses a third-party key for fail-safe refunds (so collusion and theft are still issues), Block & Chains use a network of oracles to move coins (so you instantly lose control over your money), and any exchange that relies on collateral to do anything is less than ideal and doesn\'t account for irrational actors.\n\nI released an exchange that doesn\'t suffer from these problems called \xe2\x80\x9cCoinbend\xe2\x80\x9d in 2014, but that isn\'t strictly true since micro-collateral is still required and timechains aren\'t full secure yet, but recently I\'ve been thinking that it\'s possible to create an exchange with the same properties as ShapeShift using zero-knowledge proofs and a few other innovations. It\'s even possible to do things like gambling and other financial contracts between strangers without the need for third-party trust.\n\nIt\'s a lot of work though, and I still need to put the ideal team together and find investors.': 1, 'The current set of miners would have a hard time stopping a proof of work algo change.': 1, 'It absolutely was not an operation to expose data for laundering charges (what data?

[...]\n\nBitcoin doesn\'t compete with bankers. Bitcoin is a currency system. Bankers are free to and likely to adopt Bitcoin in the case that it should become ubiquitous. Bitcoin might allow new forms of banking, and might influence the ability of central banks to control money supply, or provide the possibility to constrain Fractional Reserve Banking. It may successfully compete with other currencies.\n\n> Have them back down from their current stance on policy, to succumb to competition pressures. This is what made me buy bitcoin.

Why wouldn\'t govn\'t consider ways of balancing out competition?\n\nIf governments obsolete Bitcoin by implementing all the improvements into national currencies that Bitcoin offers, I\'d say we still win. Otherwise, I\'ve read that four times and still don\'t know what you\'re trying to say.': 1, "I'll admit I'm wrong. Very excited at the optimism as I'm willing to be invested in bitcoin for hobby's sake. I don't have interest in gold, but his predictions have been valid from the podcasts I've followed after me getting into bitcoin.": 1, 'Woah, wall of text\xe2\x80\xa6 Alright.\n\n> Bitcoin has little to no intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is based on application, and the value can vary. BTC is backed by faith, if bitcoin loses faith, there\'s no necessary application for the crypto-coin. There\'s nothing truly revolutionary about BTC, we have digitized currency and a ledger. Amazing.. Bravo... I am the caveman who has not watched sci-fi movies.\n\nCorrect, if nobody were using Bitcoin, they\'d be worthless. In fact, this is common for all types of money, because for a successful money the carrier token is less valuable than the transmitted value. This happens to be true for gold as well, as gold is worth a vast multiple of its intrinsic value. \n\n> There\'s nothing truly revolutionary about BTC, we have digitized currency and a ledger. \n\nThe revolutionary about Bitcoin is that it is the first digitized currency that doesn\'t rely on a central issuing and mediating entity. That discovery has facilitated the emergence of a multi-billion dollar currency network, which gives the system\'s units utility and therefore value. Just as with most other money technologies, the technology itself is not valuable per se, it\'s the network that the currency has created that is valuable. That\'s also why [altcoins in general don\'t stand a chance](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/the-coming-demise-of-altcoins/): Even as they copy the technology, they can\'t copy the network\'s headstart, and the utility scales exponentially with the network\'s size.\n\n> There will always be an application for gold, it\'s utility expands beyond it being a trusted currency, that gives gold value in itself. The fact that I waste my time digging for gold is based on the premise that, regardless, electronics, dentistry, etc., need gold. Miners process for BTC because, hey, it was worth $1000 dollars at one time. In layman\'s terms, a BTC miner is not guaranteed value of BTC mined.... BTC users are purely gambling with their money.\n\nIntrinsic value doesn\'t explain gold\'s value (see above). BTC miners are taking a reasonable risk based on the expectation that a technology that hasn\'t had any outages for seven years isn\'t going to end over night.\n\n> Inflation is still a threat, with all the alt-coins out, it has been said that this can devalue bitcoin. They have a fair argument. If a seller of widgets accepts more than one digital coin, that increases the supply of purchasers for the widget. The widgets\' supply is still constant. Specific to this case, some people who refute this have engaged in an important logical misstep that leads me to my next point:\n\nNo, they don\'t. In general, altcoins are intellectually barren, and fizzle out before long. There might be a small number of sufficiently distinct coins that survive by catering to niches, but all-in-all the global scope and power of the network effect make it a winner-takes-it-all market. Therefore, most altcoins don\'t have a fair argument whatsoever. Especially, as a merchant, there is no incentive for me to accept a coin whose only utility is to be traded for Bitcoin. I\'d rather rely on my customer to trade it himself, and then pay me directly in Bitcoin. \n\n> Currencies compete for market value, that is the only thing that BTC holders can rely on. How is market value determined? Through marketing. All that a currency needs is a successful marketing strategy to gain buzz, appeal, and share. An example; the Xbox put out by Microsoft was not any different than their counterparts. They relied on their name, marketing, and copyrights to push their product. As much anti-ms sentiment there has been, it outcompeted major players in the North American market. They spotted an opportunity, exploited it, and profited. Genius.\n\n"How is market value determined? Through marketing." is an oversimplification. I\'m quite sure that there were other factors that played a role in the success of the Xbox besides marketing, e.g. exclusive games and its online-gaming features, but I\'m really not interested in the console market, so I\'ll just assume that it\'s a false analogy.\n\n> BTC is governed by and as a republic with democratic controls, come on, republics are bullsh$$. Americans are getting hammered by their government. Without getting into specifics, every leading presidential candidate in this race is deceiving people. Every U.S. president in our history has violated the constitution. If you throw in the democratic controls of preference, you can see how any commodity can be subverted through proper market manipulation.\n\n[The US is an oligarchy](http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-echochambers-27074746), not a democracy. \\*tongue in cheek\\*. Bitcoin is a decentralized meritocratic open-source project. They kind of operate differently, so *without getting into specifics* \xe2\x80\x93 that\'s another false analogy.\n\n> To sum it up, you have to realize, Peter Schiff is a Republican. He\'s a successful investor and stock broker striving as a contrarian. He has to deal with explaining fundamental values/ethics to rich speculators that leverage sovereignty to secure their wealth. Comparatively, an oz of gold is worth $1323 as of today, BTC, $466. Oh man... So riddle me this, why would he advise to invest in BTC when he could very well ruin his good name? What insight can enlighten me with validation for the criticism he receives on the daily?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa6 um. I really don\'t care who that guy is, what he thinks, or whether he invests in Bitcoin. If the above are his arguments, then I have provided supple explanation why I think they are not convincing.\n\n> The good that can be taken from this, know your place. To keep it as funky as I do receiving discounts at Subway in overpriced SoCal, know your role. BTC investment is left for the hamsters. We are buying bitcoin for a specific purpose, to subvert the banking system. We are collectively instituting a private currency in a world that has banned such. That is all. No more and no less. Any opposition to that is for one betraying themselves... ok, sorry, there\'s some girl out there that really rustles my leaves about that "We don\'t want to cause mayhem, you\'re hurting BTC\'s ever fragile reputation!" narrative she pushes.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa6 um. I really don\'t care why you buy Bitcoin, or that you think so little of the Bitcoin project. Personally, I don\'t buy bitcoins to subvert the banking system. I\'m just convinced that Bitcoin is a superior form of money technology, and that the banking system is headed for another crash. Besides, Bitcoin looks healthier than ever to me.\n\n> The point still stands, BTC has its limitations. I am not, however, going to deny what has been exploited through this technology.\n\nEverything does. For example I find it really hard to send food via email.\n\n> //In all good conscience, this thread or something similar should be stickied for the sake of keeping buyers aware and, more so, wise about not committing their faith to products.

Let Peter do his job.\n\nUm. Sure. What\'s this Peter\'s job again? I thought you said he\'s rich from advising other rich dudes?
