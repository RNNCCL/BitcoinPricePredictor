Even the number of 21 million bitcoins has no real meaning:  it is just the result of how bitcoins are distributed over time to those people running the computers (starting with 50 bitcoin every 10 minutes, halving every 4 years = 50x6x24x365x4+25x6x24x265x4+etc -> 21 000 000). \n\nThe bitcoin system cannot represent other units of wealth or properties as well as the bitcoins it distributes because these units of wealth are not inherent to the blockchain and need trust outside of the blockchain as well, that's a common fallacy.

This capability has never been possible before in human history. If we all agree that there is tremendous value in an independent / decentralized wealth storage system then the price of bitcoin should rise as more and more people store their wealth in bitcoin.

Hoarding is intentionally a negative word, this is individuals saving their money, just like buying gold or putting your money in a a savings account isn\'t considered "hoarding." Our societies have encouraged spending over saving for decades through the implementation of worldwide fiat currencies with built-in inflation. It is time to remove the stigma of saving your money. For the first time in almost half a century, the average person can once again safely store their wealth and watch it appreciate in value so their children can have a better life. Bitcoin enables secure wealth storage in a way that doesn\'t rely on governments or corporations and goes above that even, since it also enables users to easily transfer that wealth to others."\n\n\n\nhttps://www.coinprices.io/articles/bitcoin-hoarders-are-not-bad-for-bitcoin-they-are-integral-to-its-success': 2, 'Very smart people indeed.\n\nGold can be divided to single atoms.

If you add together everything bitcoin consists of in a metaphysical way, like the science and mathematics behind it, and you try to build the same on green grassland, you will end up with *less* than bitcoin.\n\nBitcoin consists of humans. It is only viable because of social interaction. Making changes to the form of social interactions will always lead to resistance. And even though I find resistance against increasing block size to be more appalling than appealing, I accept that bitcoin has no value without human acceptance. That\xe2\x80\x99s why I would never call bitcoin-related dissent "ideological" \xe2\x80\x93 every side has reasons for their decision and they do not follow them because they are stupid or ideologues. They may expect a higher personal reward if the block size is changed or not. They want to follow the "true word" of the white paper (whatever this is). They cannot accept bigger blocks because of their internet connection. Other people maybe want bitcoin to stay an elitist experiment. Ok, whatever. But to dismiss that as purely ideological is, to quote the late Michael Corleone, "wrong. It\xe2\x80\x99s wrong and it\xe2\x80\x99s dangerous".\n\nWhat I want to say is that bitcoin has absolutely no value (as an experiment and as a currency) without the consent and the acceptance of the underlying social interactions. Bitcoin is a *voluntary* sociological experiment of great magnitude. Joint solutions must be found, compromises be made. The success or failure of bitcoin will indicate whether this all-important insight prevailed. And every change that is to be made to these crucial interactions must be carefully reviewed. That is why I endorse every discussion and I challenge everyone to do the same.': 3, '**No, it really isn\'t about ideology.**\n\n* It is a [straw man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) to suggest that not lifting the limit is being proposed. As, /u/nullc has been pointing out, there are other more sophisticated proposals for dealing with ***not&nbsp;only*** blocksize changes, but other alterations to the consensus algorithm.\n\n    The problem, as many have pointed out, is that causing a **hard&nbsp;fork** in the blockchain is very bad policy.\n\n* A **soft fork** is such that the "losing" minority will automatically keep updated to the "winning" majority\'s work, because the majority\'s work is still valid to the minority; it\'s just that the minority\'s work may not be valid to the majority.\n\n    Essentially, the minority has already agreed to the majority; the existing contract allows for this. This is unlike a **hard&nbsp;fork**, where at least two factions never agree on a longest chain.\n\n    A **hard fork** is a state of existence outside of any contract. The one\'s with the biggest guns win, regardless of whether they are correct. **It&nbsp;is&nbsp;war;** may those on the other side go fuck themselves.\n\n* As /u/nullc [has pointed out](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3awomg/how_the_bitcoin_experiment_might_fail/csgsdqb), it\'s not at all clear, really, that the original plan implies, say, Gavin\'s solution:\n\n    > You talk a lot about the creator of the system, but you haven\'t spoken to him-- and I doubt you know what he\'d think about today. He was no fool on time based temporary limits, having -- in fact-- coded ones into the software (e.g. the change to introduce checksums into the version handshake was pre-staged with a two year timer on it); had the system\'s creator intended it to just be like that for the block size it could have been; and if that party though their name ought to be invoked here presumably they\'d invoke it themselves rather than have you continually do so without their consent... Ultimately: It makes perfect sense to change how block limits work, when the system has the capacity handle it, no disagreements on that one; but it cannot handle the things done by some of these proposals (even if 8MB is debatable; 8192MB is not; and trends have weight in discussion but aren\'t natural law-- doubly so exponential ones).': 1}, ('Help!

And, on the timescale that prices do adjust to, currency volatility tends to average out to 6-7% inflation throughout the third world.  That level of inflation is inconsequential to most people.\n\nBut, even in failing economies or for those for whom 6-7% inflation ins't manageable bitcoin is still a poor store of value.  The reason for this is that bitcoin isn't actually volatile - rather for the past year and a half bitcoin has been in a stable downward trend, so people who put money into it lose money just by holding the bitcoins rather than their local currency.\n\nBut lets assume a best case scenario - that the relatively steady trend in bitcoins for the past 2 months continues indefinitely and bitcoin just sits around $240ish indefinitely.  Well you still lose money.  If you live in a first world nation, you are losing 3% of your value to inflation a year.  If you live in a third world country, you lose an average of 6-7% of your value for the exact same reason.\n\nObviously in the first world you can't overcome that inflation by holding your cash in a bank because interest rates are effectively 0%.  But you could hold it in a variety of other investments that can safely earn you at least what you lose to inflation.  In the third world local interest rates are typically not 0%, so you don't even have to invest your money to beat bitcoin as an investment.  And again that is in a best case scenario, given its 1.5 year trend you are likely to lose a substantial percentage of your money by investing it in bitcoins.\n\nBut lets say that despite all that someone still wants to store their money in a currency that they desire short term stability in (which you would find in an import/export business).

The first of these is bitcoin, the native token of the blockchain, adopted as a digital currency and asset that is inherently valuable because it is useful and scarce. Since most things can be represented digitally, blockchain technology is expected to be widely adopted. Cons: The system currently only supports 2-3 transactions per second but is due to be upgraded.

It is a very democratic and open platform and public utility where majority consensus rules and anyone has the power to add value.\n\n> intrinsically extremely secure\n\nThe cryptography of Bitcoin employs several strategies for layered and fundamentally unbreakable security.  It is challenging to convey the specifics but I find that the most practical detail to explain to the average person is that transactions are irreversibly, digitally signed with a secret number so long and complex it could never be guessed exactly in a trillion years even with a super computer the size of the Sun, and this secret number is called a "private key" and should be safeguarded. Whoever controls the private key can authorize a spend. It is difficult but possible to memorize the key but it is best kept on specialized computers designed for key storage, something called a hardware wallet. The only bitcoin ever hacked was from those who would not control a private key to their funds. Because signing a transaction is a one-way process which can never be reconstructed by an observer, the medium over which your transaction traverses can be insecure. This eliminates man-in-the-middle vulnerabilities that traditional payment networks have. The mass data theft from retailers we have seen are not possible but there is still similar risk if trusting knowledge of a private key to a third party.  The practical benefit of bitcoin is that the transaction is pushed from your wallet rather than pulled from your account. This push mechanism is why digital currency will succeed credit cards. \n\n> predictable inflation\n\nThe rate of new money supply with Bitcoin is well defined but this ridged definition is a matter of taste. Personally, I am not pleased how it awarded early adopters because I wasn\'t one of them.

I want a blockchain public broadcast ledger capable of storing video so true history can withstand revision. \n\n> non trivial in practice to keep and spend with 100% security\n\nThe complexity of security can be understood and possible to obtain for most. I like a cell phone Trusted execution environment. \n\n> unpredictable valuation\n\nThis. This is a true problem for a person evaluating risk.

So far, Bitcoin's proof-of-work is the only widely accepted way of maintaining a distributed time-stamped ledger.\n\nRight now, the consumption is in the 500 MW ballpark, or about as much as a medium-sized city. Bitcoin advocates will inevitably compare this with the some figure of the power consumption of the traditional banking sector, but I don't find this relevant: Bitcoin's power consumption comes from proof-of-work.\n\nOn the other hand, this is mitigated by the halving of the mining reward every four years, which should also halve total power consumption. So in effect, if the value of a bitcoin (only) doubles every four years, the global power consumption should stay constant.": 3, '> Someone in my family has often supposedly quoted numerous examples of how bitcoin is weak.\n\n"weak"?

No one, other than the wallet owners, will know how many Bitcoins they have. Even if the wallet address was to be publicized, a new wallet address can be easily generated. This would greatly increase privacy for Greeks when compared to traditional currency systems, where third parties have access to personal financial data.\n\nThere is no way for a third party to intercept transactions of Bitcoins, unless they know the subjects address and therefore there is no viable way to implement a Bitcoin taxation system. The only way to pay a tax would be, if people of greece voluntarily sends a percentage of the amount being sent as tax. People of Greece would not have to pay any tax.\n\n\nOnce Bitcoins are sent, the transaction cannot be reversed. Once bitcoins are sent, it is impossible to revert the transaction. This ensures that there is no risk involved when receiving Bitcoins. But it can be bad too if coins are sent by mistake to the wrong address. Greeks will be freed of credit card chargebacks which is a major issue for merchants and stores.\n\nSending and receiving Bitcoins requires users to keep the Bitcoin client running and connected to other nodes. Its as simple as running a Windows program and be connected to the internet. The fees to use the network is minimal. To send to anyone in Greece or the whole wide world 500 euro worth of BTC someone would have to pay 0.50\xe2\x82\xac worth of BTC. This would free Greeks of banks paypal and traditional transaction fiat fees which are super high (paypal 10%).\n\nNo one can steal Bitcoins unless they have physical access to a user\xe2\x80\x99s computer, and they send the bitcoins to their account. So the people of Greece become their own bank securing their wealth the best they can. This can be bad too because of weak passwords or gun point house robberies.\n\nBitcoins are still only accepted by a very small group of online merchants. This makes it unfeasible to completely rely on Bitcoins as a currency for Greece. There is also a possibility that government might force merchants to not use Bitcoins to ensure that Greek transactions can be tracked.\n\nIf a hard drive crashes, or a virus corrupts data , and the wallet file is corrupted, Bitcoins have essentially been \xe2\x80\x9clost\xe2\x80\x9d. There is nothing that can done to recover it. These coins will be forever orphaned in the system. Unless a backup system is in place. This can bankrupt a family of Greeks with no way or form of recovery. The coins will also be permanently orphaned.\n\nThe value of Bitcoins is constantly fluctuating according to demand. This constant fluctuation will cause Bitcoin accepting sites and shops to continually change prices. It will also cause a lot of confusion if a refund for a product is being made. For example, if a t shirt was initially bought for 1.5 BTC, and returned a week later, should 1.5 BTC be returned, even though the valuation has gone up, or should the new amount be sent? That is a major drawback for Greeks trying to make a day to day living off of Bitcoin.\n\nWhen goods are bought using Bitcoins, and the seller doesn\xe2\x80\x99t send the promised goods, nothing can be done to reverse the transaction. This problem can be solved using a third party escrow service, but then, escrow services would assume the role of banks, which would cause Bitcoins to be similar to  more traditional currencies. Centralization of coins is never a good thing for the people of greece as these whale type escrow services can leave the country or close shops leaving the people of Greece cashless (Bitcoinless ;)\n\nSince the total number of bitcoins is capped at 21 million, it will cause deflation. Each bitcoin will be worth more and more as the total number of Bitcoins maxes out. This system is designed to reward early adopters. Since each bitcoin will be valued higher with each passing day, the question of when to spend becomes important. This might cause spending surges which will cause the Bitcoin economy to fluctuate very rapidly, and unpredictably. This is not how a day to day currency should operate favoring the early birds in a real life scenario and would encourage hoarding leaving the Greek economy stagnant.\n\nSince there is no central authority governing Bitcoins, no one can guarantee its minimum valuation. This would cause major issues with the Greek people trying to establish a price for Bitcoin.\n\n\nThere are multiple copies of the transactions database all over the world and inside the wallets that are installed on computers, that validate the sum of coins someone has, also a 51% attack is not possible due to hardware limitations and cost, so no one can seize your bitcoins. The most someone can do is force the user, by other means, to send the bitcoins to someone else by virus or fraud. This means that governments can\xe2\x80\x99t freeze someone\xe2\x80\x99s wealth, and thus users of Bitcoins will have complete freedom to do anything they want with their coins. That would provide to the Greek people security of wealth and economic freedom.\n\n\n\n\nA THING TO REMEMBER\n\nYou are not poor when you have no money,you are poor when you have nothing to offer.

That we have a minimal number of full nodes "deployed" by an increasingly large majority of server users, instead of desktop users, is just symptomatic of launching such a poorly understood but incredibly disruptive technology. The users demand scaling of a flood based messenging network that quickly bloats up into something unmanageable for home desktop users if left unculled, this is fact.

The fees were paid in barter to the priests: \xe2\x80\x9cdeath and taxes\xe2\x80\x9d.*\n\n    For a corpse being brought to the grave,\n    his beer was seven jugs, and his bread 420 loaves.\n    Two barig (72 l.) of hazi-barley, one woolen garment,\n    one lead goat, and one bed the undertaker took away,\n    and one barig (36 l.) of barley the person(s) of ... took away.\n    When (for burial) into the reeds of Enki a person was brought,\n    his beer was seven jugs and his bread 420 loaves.\n    Two barig of barley, one woolen garment, one bed, and one chair\n    the undertaker took away,\n    and one barig of barley the person(s) of ... took away.\n    The craftmen {ferry boatmen} were the ones who did get,\n    and it was paired-workmen who\n    the ferry toll for the main gate (of the netherworld) did get.\n\n[Here is another one](http://exhibitions.nypl.org/treasures/items/show/120):\n\n    May they give ... two reed mats [to] Ur-Gu-gu, the janitors!\n\n    Two items of barley flour from L?-dingir-ra.\n\n    ... to inspect and control the plowmen.\n\n    Sixty-eight workmen paid per day for carrying har-an-plants, \n    30 workmen paid per day for removing earth, \n    20 workmen paid per day are stationed at the inlet of the canal....\n\n    Nine dead sheep from Lugal-sum-ma-ti \n    ... two dead goats ... \n    Ur-Nin-mug has received [in exchange for a large quantity of garments]\n\n    L?-sa-lim the son of the sanga-priest ... \n    and Gem?-En-lil his wife have bought a house \n    in good repair or in ruins [i.e., as is], \n    the purchase price being 18 1/6 shekel silver.\n\nNote the coexistence of barter payments with payments in silver.  Those texts are from Sumer, which was already a millennium or two after the Mohenjo-Daro civilization of India was exporting glass beads to the surrounding areas.  And several millenia after unknown peoples were trading obsidian, tin, copper, silex, etc. all over Europe. And so on...\n\nIn the 16th-17th centuries, trade between the Europeans and American Natives was by barter.  Food, beaver pelts, tobacco, brazilwood and much more was traded for steel knives and fishhooks, mirrors and glass beads, etc..\n\nHis description of tribal economy is wrong too.  Hunter-gatherers economy is based on sharing, not on mental accounting of debts and credits.  The hunter who catches a big animal will share with other hunters who came back empty-handed, without any accounting of who owes who.  Because he knows, even without thinking, that tomorrow may be his turn to be unlucky; and that the tribe fares better if resources are shared, even if the sharing is strongly unbalanced, than if unlucky or less able hunters are left to starve.  There is no parasitism, because each hunter knows that if he fails at the hunting, the tribe may starve, and then he will starve too.  Adapting to the concept of "property", "credit" and "debt" has been one of the major cultural traumas in the Westernization of Native Americans.\n\n': 1, 'Terrific presentation.\n\nAs others have said try to slow down just a bit.\n\nAnd I think you could improve the last third or so of the presentation.

And the best way to understand money is to understand the history of money...\n\n> Anthropologists agree that there\'s no tribe, much less a civilization, that ever based its commerce on barter. There\'s no evidence. *Barter never happened.* And that\'s counterintuitive to most of us because we are taught in school that we first barter and then we made money because barter was too complicated.\n\n> Well, barter never happened and that\'s one of the key myths about money. So then you would ask the anthropologists, "So how did we do commerce before money if there was no barter? There was no commerce." No, there was plenty of commerce and the way that commerce would happen is that let\'s say that someone in our tribe killed a big buffalo and I would go up to a person and say hey, "Can I have a little bit of meat?" And that person would say "No" or "Yes, Wences, here\'s your meat." And then you would go up to a person and say "Hey, can I have a little bit of meat?" and that person said "Yes, here\'s your meat." And basically we all have to keep track in our heads of what we owed other people or what our people owed us.\n\n': 3, "I can understand what he's saying! ...even with that horrid echo": 1, 'Thanks appreciate the kind words!': 1, "Omg haha!

Think farming, or coming across two edible animals in a clearing, or a tree a long way from your village that is full of fruit, or any kind of modern day mass production.\n\n> with barter everyone will just produce for his daily needs.\n\nApart from the issue of efficiency, comes the demand mismatch. Yes, it's more efficient to kill two animals in one hunting trip, and someone will probably want the meat, but do you want something that they have?\n\nYou need an intermediary things of value (money). \n\nAgain, you could formulate that money as debt rather than a thing of value to be bartered, but it is unnecessary to do so.": 1, 'I loved this presentation of Wences.': 1, 'As you already explained GetGems is focused more on telegram side of it and it is really doing well. We are more focused on consumer spending side of bitcoin. ': 2}, ('SafeMarket - A trustless, decentralized, pseudonymous marketplace powered by bitcoin', 56): {'[deleted]': -1, 'I\'m sorry if I\'m coming off as rude, I know that it\'s counter-productive and I don\'t intend to alienate you - but this is honestly such an obvious and egregiously bad choice that I\'m a bit shocked. What makes it such a bad idea? Let me count the ways:\n\n1. The add-on is not cryptographically signed in any way, and its authenticity (and functionality, including potentially malicious functionality) is entirely dependent on the security of HTTPS and GitHub\'s goodwill (and/or their immunity to lawful requests from a government - which they do not have). Due to how add-on containers like .xpi are handled automatically in the browser, it is also much more difficult for users to properly verify any potential detached signatures.\n\n2. A browser add-on works in very close proximity to sensitive user data, both at rest and in transit, whether that data is related to the add-on\'s functionality or not. There is enormous potential for "collateral damage" in the event of a security issue.\n\n3. A browser add-on can, either intentionally or inadvertently, leak through or bypass any configured proxy(ies) or forwarding schemes that protect the user\'s privacy, like Tor, Privoxy or I2P, or can cause other aspects of the user session to experience such bypasses or leaks. It can be very difficult to avoid this, especially in complex applications interacting with the enormous number of libraries and routines involved with a modern browser.\n\n4. Users with Add-Ons typically use more than one. Add-ons may interact with one another in unexpected and dangerous ways, particularly when privacy is a concern. One Add-On may configure a proxy while another configures a different one, with undefined results. Similar behavior should be anticipated with nearly any network-enabled Add-On in the presence of potentially competing Add-Ons. With literally thousands of Add-Ons available on a multitude of platforms (including the numerous forks of Firefox and Chromium like Tor Browser, etc.), anticipating and keeping on top of potential conflicts like these is not a practical task for any developer.\n\n5. Browsers are issued critical updates on a frequent basis, and generally are self-updating. Oftentimes, these updates introduce breaking changes or regressions as pertain to some Add-Ons, and the Add-On developer must release an updated version to work with the new browser release. This creates a ton of unneccessary work for the developer (you), and introduces risk to the user if some Add-Ons become silently (or near-silently) disabled, or even worse (though rare), if they should introduce a regression of some kind with undesirable effects.\n\n6. Browser Add-Ons with high security requirements (like yours, or any that might deal with money or cryptographic secrets) may be vulnerable to exploitation and alteration from within the browser (websites), whether due to a drive-by 0day exploit or just a clever, malicious rival Add-On developer.\n\n7. Passwords, cryptocurrency addresses and other sensitive inputs intended for browser Add-Ons may in some cases be intercepted or altered by other Add-Ons or even scripts running on a loaded website.\n\n8. Browser Add-Ons are more difficult to secure than standalone applications, since they execute in the Browser\'s environment. This prevents any possibility of specified firewall rules, SELinux/AppArmor profiles, QoS, or any other specific configurations that may be relevant to apply. All browser Add-Ons must, by their nature, be run as the same user and with the same parameters and permissions as the browser.\n\n9. Any potential debugging and logging are complicated greatly (or nullified) as well, for browser Add-Ons.\n\n10. Advising **any** user to install **any** Add-Ons in Tor Browser is just a plain Bad Idea, largely for some of the reasons listed above. Tor Browser is very specifically and carefully configured to be run in its "stock" state, and any Add-Ons can (and probably will) introduce undefined behavior.\n\n11. Browsers crash frequently (at least more frequently than most software) and this can interrupt the operation of Add-Ons unrelated to the activity that caused the crash. This can introduce undefined behavior in the browser, the Add-On, or both.\n\n12. Browser Add-Ons cannot be easily daemonized for full-time, low-impact availability.\n\n13. Browsers are a frequent target of Adware bundles and other miscellaneous Nasties which may intercept or interfere with the operation and inputs of installed Add-Ons.\n\n14. The use of browser Add-Ons as applications in general encourages precisely the wrong approach to systems security by piling all your important operations into a single, conjoined platform instead of a modular, compartmentalized set of applications. On top of that, it does so in a high-value target for exploitation that is virtually always connected to a network.\n\nI could probably go on, but I imagine the point has been made.\n\nPlease, I strongly urge you to begin planning to port this as a standalone application (it could even be in addition to the Add-On). It would be a lot of work, I know, but keep in mind that it doesn\'t necessarily have to be *you* doing it - a good Lead Developer can sometimes get lucky enough to organize a real team of coders.': 2, "I don't think it can yet be run on Tor.": 1, 'Thanks - I found it under the data directory:\n\nhttps://github.com/SafeMarket/SafeMarket/tree/master/data\n\n': 2, "I took a look at the slack but didn't see anything.
