": 1, "You could easily understand why paper notes would be superior to gold (ease of storage, measurement, transfer, etc.) so the question will  be: why did governments choose to devalue paper money by printing more than could be backed by gold, ultimately leading to complete separation from gold backing?\n\nThe answer is that government officials frequently believe that the funds confiscated from the people are more efficiently spent by themselves than by the citizens. This could be attributed to malice (greeedy politicians!) or simply that politicians, like most people, believe they understand which ends are the most important for the world and are trying to achieve them.\n\nA good example is war. A politician might believe that citizens will be unwilling to voluntarily fund the war effort against Nazi germany, but the government can use the power of inflation to confiscate value from citizens to spend on the war effort. It's easy to understand (right or wrong) how a government official might think his choice to spend the people's money on the war effort is more valid than citizens' preference to retain their money.": 1, 'Half of America does not believe in Darwinian evolution or know that it takes one year for the Earth to complete one orbit around the sun.

Historically the reason we ended up with a fiat currency system was war. Specifically World War 1. Everyone expected the the war to be over by Christmas 1914 (which would make the whole thing about 6 months long) because it would run out of money. It would have as well, but they came off the gold standard and implemented the "my bank balance is what I say it is" standard so that they could finance the war. That\'s why it lasted as long as it did that\'s why the 20th century was so bloody; unlimited money for unlimited war.\n\nIn 1930ish (can\'t remember exactly) it was made illegal for US citizens to own gold, and they were forced (under penalty of 10 years in federal prison) to "sell" their gold to the government for $20 an ounce. Then the government devalued the dollar relative to gold by 40%, taking it to $35 per ounce. This amounted to nothing more than 40% confiscation of the wealth of the American public, and the whole reason for it was so the US could pay off war debt. And the whole reason the US even got involved in WW1 was so that Woodrow Wilson could get America a seat at the peace talks where the spoils of war would be divided up. He wanted a piece of it.

In fact you can specifically identify what it is they believe they are achieving. Increases in the money supply cause people to feel richer than they are, as prices take time to adjust, but the money enters someone\'s pocket as it is printed. The process of equilibrium being reached when new money is printed involves increased levels of spending which, importantly, is often misinterpreted to imply a strong, healthy, or "good" economy.\n\nThe inverse is true of deflation. When the supply of money and liquid credit instruments (a money substitute) shrinks, people feel poorer and prices must adjust downwards to set a new equilibrium. The mechanism by which prices fall is that market players try to save more money and sell more goods and services. This causes a short term reduction to GDP and is interpreted as a "bad" economy. \n\nBoth over and under consumption are inefficient, but the former is seen as "good" and the latter as "bad." Since people feel rich during periods of over-consumption and poor during periods of under-consumption.\n\nThis phenomenon leads to politicians actually believing that inflation will help the economy and deflation will harm it. I don\'t believe they are malicious, merely ignorant.': 1, 'Is it the case that eventually the money will leak out into the wider economy, causing inflation?

I can't accept that the 'people at the top' are genuinely either evil or extremely ignorant. There must be more to it?": 1, 'Low demand and deflationary pressures. ': 1, "Because QE money only goes directly to banks to sit in their accounts keeping bad debt good.\n\nSo it doesn't become realised in the real economy.\n\nSo as its a debt based money, huge amounts of QE money can simply be used to service debt basicly canceling each other out.": 3, ' The belief that all debt based fiat systems are doomed to collapse is not necessarily universally held. It is entirely possible to think (and govern) otherwise. ': 2, "what's your educated guess timeline wise?": 1, 'QE happens because governments are terrified of deflation. Now deflation (in an asset based system like gold or bitcoin or whatever) is a good thing because that means stuff is cheaper tomorrow. When you go to the gas pump and it costs you 10% less to fill the tank, that\'s kinda nice. That means you have 10% left over to do something else with whether that\'s save it or spend it on something else.\n\nBut governments hate deflation because it rewards savers but punishes debtors. If you owe $1000 today, in a deflationary system $1000 is actually MORE money a year from now. So the incentive is not to get into debt. Governments are the biggest debtors by far, and rather than pay the money back what they want to do is make the problem go away by causing inflation. That what they can inflate their debts away rather than pay them back.\n\nBecause people aren\'t taking on debt, we\'re going the other way we\'re going back into deflation, so the governments are trying to brute force inflation by just printing a lot of money, and when that doesn\'t work they\'ll print more, and when that doesn\'t work they\'ll print more, and so on. If it doesn\'t work the solution is "you didn\'t do enough of it".\n\nFiat currencies are not necessarily a one way trip to inflation, but they are a one way trip to collapse. I said earlier that DEFLATION is a good thing in an asset based system (like a gold standard), and that is true. But we don\'t have an asset based system we have a DEBT based system.\n\nA debt based system is fundamentally unstable. From day one it is doomed to fail, either by inflation or deflation it doesn\'t really matter the end result is the same. Mike Maloney\'s video series is spot on (cannot recommend his material enough). When you create a unit of currency, you create lets say 2 units of debt (its not a 2:1 ratio in reality, but there must always be MORE debt than currency created). So you now owe 2 units, so you create 2 more and now you have 3 units of currency and 6 units of debt, and so on. When you pay back a unit of debt with a unit of currency you cancel out at a 1:1 ratio, but you STILL have that remainder of debt and nothing to pay it with.\n\nThat\'s why the system collapses you either keep creating money and debt until the proportion of debt to currency grows to unsustainable levels, and collapses. Or, you pay back the debt but as you do that you also remove the currency from the system and again the ratio of debt to currency grows (they are both going down, but currency goes down faster than debt, so the disparity grows), until again there is way more debt than currency, and it collapses.\n\nThat\'s the madness of a debt based fiat system if you take on debt the system collapses if you pay back debt the system collapses.': 6, "So is there any estimate of 'raw currency' if that makes any sense? I suppose, we could work it out from history? Start with the original total number of dollars when it was still on a 1:1 gold standard, then add all the newly printed notes since?": 1, "I'd be amazed if such a calculation is possible because my suspicion is that no one actually has any clue exactly how much money is in the system. If you take all of the debt (federal, state, municipal, personal and unfunded liabilities like pensions) and add it all up, its somewhere between 100 and 200 trillion USD. That's a pretty vague estimate if you can only narrow it down to a range of 100 trillion dollars. I don't think that's because the people that do the calculations are stupid I think its just the best they can do with the data they have. \n\nI might be wrong I'd be fascinated if someone has some kind of accurate picture and I'd be even more interested to learn how they came up with it, but I certainly haven't heard of a way.": 1, 'Interesting- so in theory our current fiat currencies could actually still be around in a thousand years? If so, how do they get around the problem of a constantly worsening debt/actual currency ratio?': 1, "I agree with your sentiment buddy. I'm sure there are thousands of people out there far more educated on these matters than us who genuinely believe fiat money is superior to any backed currency.": 1, "There are 3 main reasons. The first is that the government calculates inflation using the consumer price index, and then manipulates it to suit itself. They have a list of 24 common goods (bread, milk, eggs, petrol etc) and they pick 10, average out the percentage cost increase on last year, and that gives them the inflation rate.\n\nHowever, the 10 that they choose change every year. If petrol was on the list last year because it only went up 1%, and this year it went up 10%, they take it off the list and swap it with say eggs that only went up 2%. They'll always just pick the lowest 10 to suit themselves.\n\nThe second reason is that all of the QE money is just sitting there. Inflation is not a measure of the money supply but money supply x velocity. Its only as excess money circulates through the economy that inflation kicks in. What's happened here is that there was a big QE program, they handed the money to the banks, and the banks sat on it. It makes them look (on paper) solvent when they are not. Its only once this money starts to make the rounds in the economy that we will see the inflation. Of course all this means is that the banks are sitting on an inflation time bomb.\n\nLastly, fractional reserve lending is down. People are, unbelievably, quite sensible. Or at least they are these days. People are tightening their belts, living within their means, NOT taking on debt, and paying off existing debt as fast as they can. Fractional reserve is nothing but debt its money loaned into existence.\n\nThe whole system feeds on debt it needs debt to work, and it needs ever increasing levels of debt. So, for the economy at large, people getting OUT of debt is actually a bad thing. They aren't borrowing, so no new money is being created, and they are paying off debt, which destroys currency (when you pay back a unit of debt with a unit of currency, they cancel out).\n\nThat's the problem the government is facing they need people to take on debt and they just won't and that's why western economies are going into, oh horror of horrors, deflation.": 14, "> Of course all this means is that the banks are sitting on an inflation time bomb.\n\nThis makes sense to me, so I'm a bit confused as to why QE is happening in the first place? \n\n>They aren't borrowing, so no new money is being created, and they are paying off debt, which destroys currency (when you pay back a unit of debt with a unit of currency, they cancel out).\n\nThis is fascinating! So fiat currencies aren't necessarily on a one way trip to inflation? It is possible for the money supply to actually shrink, without any central bank intervention? I did not know this.\n\nI recently saw the 'hidden secrets of money' series and it did make the point that once there is more debt than 'actual money' in the system, the only way to pay off debt is by going into debt- i.e., after a point of time, it is simply not possible to pay off a nation's debt, am I reading this right?": 3, "I think this all sounds a bit too conspiracyish to me. But there's every chance that in six months time I'll come to agree.

Its very profitable for him to play within the current system, and it would be a great personal cost to him to try to change it. The incentive structure is set up that its not worth while to try and overthrow the system.": 1, '> fiat currencies aren\'t necessarily on a one way trip to inflation? It is possible for the money supply to actually shrink, without any central bank intervention? I did not know this.\n\nYou got it.

I had to study this for my job for a (failed) mobile payment system I created for a client 2 years ago.  The technology was completely reliable, scalable, and secure at every point of the transaction; the problem was that consumers had no incentive to pick our system over a credit card.\n\nThere is nothing easier than a credit card for in-person transactions.  There is little more powerful than the 3-man bribery system the credit card industry has used to insert itself into nearly every transaction in the US.  Raise the prices of every good and service by 4% to accommodate credit card transaction fees, make it an indispensable part of American commerce, "reward" consumers with a slight bribe (miles, points, 1% cash back, whatever) to make them feel like smart consumers, then pocket the rest as profit.\n\nTrillions of dollars of transaction history shows that people spend more when they have access to credit.\n\nThe next easiest transaction is cash -- a close second assuming the payment doesn\'t require a signature.\n\nI don\'t know a single person who wouldn\'t take a $5 bill if I handed it to them.  Most people I show a QR code to have a confused look on their faces.\n\nWhen you use Bitcoin to pay for purchases, you lose a lot.\n\nYou lose:\n\n* your ability to reverse a charge if what you buy isn\'t what you paid for, or if the merchant cheats you.\n* You do not have the shoulders of VISA or MasterCard to stand on if a merchant treats you poorly.\n* You do not collect miles, points, or rewards.\n* You do not have the convenience of deferring a payment for something today until the end of the month.\n* You do not get a friendly end-of-year statement categorizing how you spent your money.\n* You do not build credit for the large purchases you will need later in life, like houses and cars.\n* You do not get reimbursed if your money goes missing.  Unauthorized credit card charges disappear from your bill.  Money taken from your checking account gets replaced.  BTC missing?  That\'s a rough day.\n* You do not have the convenience of financing a purchase you choose to pay for over time.  While I think that last part is a good thing (people shouldn\'t finance their day-to-day purchases), most of America will disagree.\n\nWhat you get:\n\n* The satisfaction of knowing if the American Dollar ever loses its place in the world, you\'ve got a backup plan.  (paranoid much?)\n* Semi-anonymous transactions (better run your TOR correctly)\n* The ability to purchase illegal drugs and materials on any given day that the FBI is not tracking down the buyers, administrators and sellers of the latest incarnation of Silk Road.\n* The ability to convey value remotely over the Internet without a middle man.\n* You remove the VISA/MasterCard tax from every purchase you make.\n* You gain extreme currently risk / volatility from holding your an asset that can fluctuate in value by 10% a day some days.\n\n\nThe value proposition of Bitcoin is interesting, but it is not aligned with the interests of the people who execute 99% of the transactions needed to facilitate life in the Western world.  Bitcoin has a place; it is more than just a conversation piece, but it is not anything that mainstream America is going to rely on any time soon.\n\nWhat\'s Bitcoin good for?\n\n* Foreign remittance.  This is amazingly good at this.  Done properly Western Union won\'t exist in 5 years.\n* Buying illegal things anonymously.\n* Committing irrevocable transactions -- not a typical consumer transaction.\n* Covering your tracks (tokenized transactions), but not really because there\'s a permanent record that can be reconstructed (blockchain).  You can\'t tell me the last 3 places that dollar bill was, but I can reconstruct your entire wallet activity, given enough time. Whose wallet is it?  I don\'t know.\n\nBitcoin is not a consumer technology.  IDK if you ever followed Linux, but for 10 years, someone in the community would always declare "This is the year of the Linux Desktop!", then eventually that became a joke.  Linux finally embraced what it was good at (server, IoT, reliable embedded, etc.), instead of focusing on trying to be what it isn\'t (a consumer desktop).  It\'s a roaring success.\n\nBitcoin needs to learn something from Linux and embrace what it\'s good at, instead of trying to shove it at everybody, trying to make it be something it isn\'t.\n\nUnfortunately the powers that be have a vested interest in getting some BTC into everybody\'s pocket, as, in theory, that would increase demand and make price go up.  This desire is going to prevent Bitcoin from becoming something it\'s truly good at, as what it is good at will not make speculators any money, and the investment in Bitcoin is largely by investors hoping to get their BTC to appreciate by creating the Bitcoin economy.\n\nThe other unfortunate aspect about Bitcoin in commerce, is that there\'s no more certain way in the world to shrink the Bitcoin economy then to go to a merchant and use Bitcoin to buy it.  Behind the scenes, 99% of those merchants instantly convert the BTC you just paid with into US Dollars.  They do not want to experience currency risk.  Every time you use a Bitcoin to buy something, that merchant converts it from BTC -> USD, removing that amount of value from the Bitcoin economy.\n\nBitcoin as a technology is incredible and can change the world.  Bitcoin as an asset class is a failure.  If you took the blockchain technology and had a trusted 3rd party take an asset like an auditable quantity of gold or a fixed amount of fiat currency and issued it in digital form, that would revolutionize how money is exchanged as it would put the currency risk back into the realm of a known quantity.\n\nBitcoin as an asset is backed only by the trust that the mathematics provides.  For you and me, that is a great thing, but for the rest of the world, knowing that their US Dollar bills are backed by the American military and one of the most vibrant economies of the world is far more powerful.  Most don\'t understand that fiat currency devalues itself whenever more is created.\n\nThe barrier here is poor consumer education on the topic, a technology barrier, unfamiliarity with the concept of digital currency, and existing trust in far more convenient forms of remittance such as VISA, MasterCard and Cash.\n\nVisa and MasterCard spend BILLIONS of dollars reminding consumers that they can\'t live without them.  Bitcoin has no such army of marketing gurus.\n\nSo I gotta say, in response to "But it sure is convenient to use.", I\'d have to disagree, for most people it is not convenient at all.': 2, 'Absolutely!

If a single one of them actually owns it, I'd say you hit the jackpot.": 2, 'Yes, but my time is limited over the next few days.  I will respond at some point, or partially until then.\n\nOne thing I will say before you respond, is that human behavior is extraordinarily difficult to change, and costly to influence effectively.\n\nThe barriers to change are that people embrace what they are comfortable & familiar with.  Change in any significant form requires constant prodding and reminders, usually in the form of marketing messages, advertising, placement, and incentives for changing behaviors.  This isn\'t a "Bitcoin Thing", it\'s a human thing.  If your responses can get past these barriers, I will seriously be impressed.\n\nAny adequate way to overcome this in a commercial setting will require *billions* of dollars, tens or hundreds of them if you want to change the way the world buys things.  Hundreds of millions of people are programmed to behave a particular way, and they fear change.  They are complacent.  They fear loss.  They feel stupid when they make a mistake.  They embrace that which they understand so they neither make a mistake, nor suffer a loss, nor feel stupid.  Look at Apple products - they are wildly successful because at every opportunity, Apple\'s design has made it difficult to feel stupid using it.  I don\'t see how Bitcoin is ever going to get to this level.\n\nThe only things that sell themselves are free pizza and free beer.\n\nWhen VISA / MasterCard designed their products (a credit card IS a product), they took all of the human factors into mind.  Every one of these removed a barrier from using their product.\n\n* Fear of losing money?  We will reverse your transactions!\n* Fear of making a mistake?  What\'s simpler than swiping your card?\n* Want to feel like a savvy consumer? Earn yourself a "free" trip to Hawaii every time you use our product.\n* Want to be a smart consumer?  We will tell you how you spend your money in a nice end of year report.\n* Want to know your purchases are safer with VISA?  Free warranty extender for Platinum card members.\n* Want to impress your friends?  VISA Black for you, only the best can get it.\n* Need help anywhere on the planet using your card?  24 hour toll-free number with friendly customer service reps there to hold your hand.\n\nEvery aspect of a modern credit card addresses a human desire or ego.\n\nNothing about Bitcoin is nearly this attractive.  Bitcoin is functional, and doesn\'t address consumer needs.  It hasn\'t been productized.  Visa & MC were able to do what they are doing by charging fees.  If you do that with Bitcoin, you\'ve lost the appeal of it.\n\nMoral of the story, VISA / MC have the whole package in place.  They have spent the last 40 years re-engineering the US and world economies to use their system, and they\'ve got a thousand different ways to keep people coming back.\n\nThe other real problem with Bitcoin is that it doesn\'t operate on a trust model humans are familiar with.  I trust that my bank has an employee with a ledger that\'s able to tell me how much money is in my account.  Somebody I trust is looking at a written record.  If the numbers are wrong, a history of receipts can be used to correct things.  Same thing with credit cards.  But Bitcoin?  I\'ve been aware of Bitcoin for years, did a tiny bit of mining right when the clients were still alpha / beta and BTC was $15.  Silly me for not sticking with it.  I still can\'t tell anybody *how* Bitcoin works in a way that they can comprehend.\n\nThe story for Bitcoin is one filled with mystery.  As a consumer, I can conceptualize a credit card company keeping track of my individual transactions.  Blockchain???? Nobody in the history of mankind has ever tracked a transaction like this until Bitcoin was launched.  I cannot explain it to my Grandfather, I cannot explain it to my nephew.  People don\'t like using things they cannot comprehend unless the convenience of using it compensates for their doubts.\n\nThink of Bitcoin as a consumer product, not unlike a car, a computer, a tablet, a phone, and ask yourself, why would I have a landline wired telephone at home, when everybody else on the planet has cell phones?  "Land line phones are more reliable", "The call quality is superior".  Those are admirable traits to have in a product, not much unlike having a currency that is mathematically trustworthy and cryptographically secure.  Well, people want to text and not be tied down to a wire attached to their handset.  They also like their frequent flyer miles and paying for things weeks/months after they buy them.  This is how Bitcoin needs to be considered versus other forms of remittance.  There\'s simply no obvious reason for any consumer to seek this out.\n\nAnyway, fire away with a response!': 1, 'Yeah I tend to purchase with the qr.

I don\'t even go on /r/music anymore because as an indie musician with an MBA I positively cringe at the kids telling me to just "adjust"  to the new reality of nobody paying for my work. And any time I jump in to argue the facts of this "new world"  (like how more than 25% of the top grossing artists from last year were Top 40 artists 40 years ago,  when 40 years ago NONE of the Top 40 artists had been in music more than 30 years) I get assraped by kids telling me to "adjust"  to free. \n\nReddit can be so odd. I know it isn\'t homogenous but still... So odd. \n\nEdit : if the above statistic means nothing to you, I\'ll break it down. Streamed singles are not sticky, they don\'t make fans. **Tangible albums make fans.** *Tangibility* is sticky. *Albums* encourage listeners to fall in love with the whole catalog not just a single. Fans are people who know all your songs not just a single. Do you want to pay $30 to go to a show to hear the one single?  No concerts are not fun for most people if they only know one song. As a result a very distorted group of artists are still making the lion\'s share of money: those artists who came of age in the Album Age and were able to establish durable fan bases.
