If Bob, as a merchant, "accepts Bitgo Instant payments" that means that he will look at a transaction and see if it\'s a Bitgo Instant Payment (through Bitgo\'s API, which, by the way, accounts for malleated txids because not everyone is dumb like mtgox) and if it is.

You\'ll have to decide for yourself whether we accomplished that, but here\'s some [sample code](https://21.co/learn/21-lib-channels/#setup) that sets up a little payment channels capable server:\n\n    import datetime\n    import flask\n    from two1.lib.wallet import Wallet\n    from two1.lib.bitserv.flask import Payment\n        \n    app = flask.Flask(__name__)\n    payment = Payment(app, Wallet())\n\n    @app.route(\'/current-time\')\n    @payment.required(50)\n    def current_time():\n        return str(datetime.datetime.now())\n  \n    if __name__ == "__main__":\n        app.run(host="0.0.0.0", port=5000, debug=True)\n\nThe `payment.required` line is the key bit that charges 50 satoshis per request.

Fiat systems are set up to fulfill this important need. But fiat systems are not required to have money. Fiat is only one potential variety.  Fiat money has the unique attribute that it is a pure notion that's value is managed by authority. This is a scam. The purpose of fiat is to put into narrow hands the ability to manufacture notions of value that benefit the narrow hands. It is pre meditated, well conceived and there is an avalanche of evidence supporting that it is a scheme. It is peddled as all manner of things that we should want for the greater good, but that is all nonsense.  \n\nThe current global fiat scam is reaching its endpoint. Suppressed rates, negative rates, QE, the 2008 stock market crash and subsequent boom, huge banks failing.  These are all symptoms of the pattern that has happened time and again when fiat fails.

The last act is to wipe out their debts and therefore our assets on account at their banks. That's the way it is designed to work. \n\n\nAccurately viewed central banking is a criminal syndicate.

It\'d be a service that would grow along with a fee market (a necessary part of it, in other words), which is currently a likely outcome of "undersized" blocks (from a agnostic transactional perspective). A fee market is likely going to emerge in the next year or two.\n\nConcept \n\nLarge mining operations would guarantee confirmation in the blocks they mine to customers of their MAAS. They\'d sell that service for a set number of months or years in a subscription model. A person or organization would open an account and pay up front to guarantee their transactions make it into a block and not have to worry about transaction fees, mempools, and day-long confirmations. Customers would effective pay zero transaction fees on individual txns, paying for all of them up front. This would enable division of labor and specialization, and add certainty to a miner\'s income. Levels of subscription will be available, like 4 txns / day or 10 /day, or 100 / day. \n\nUsability \n\nThis type of solution can exist in a nested structure of services, too. Perhaps a merchant uses lightning network payment channels with customers. They open and close these channels with customers at varying times and for varying lengths of time. LN basically has the ability to consolidate many small transactions into larger transactions in a trust-extending way. But the merchant needs to be able to settle those channels to the mainnet (blockchain) in an efficient manner without the risk of the opening or settlement getting stuck in the mempool of unconfirmed txns. So they subscribe to a MAAS provider, and transmit the transactions directly to the MAAS endpoint. A lightning channel has two txns, from what I understand, an opening one and a closing one. They can include 100s or 1000s of smaller transfers between those two.\n\nWages or other important txns may go through a MAAS because they are simply too important. Contracts for large business deals (like import/export txns or just-in-time supply chain txns) will have to take into consideration txns times and risks, and could have a section on the use of a specific MAAS. \n\nVisible aspect\n\nTransactions could be encrypted and be sent to the miner using api keys for access, which is the common way services work already. A merchant could advertise the fact that they use a certain well known miner, similar to how they advertise that they use Visa, Mastercard or PayPal today.\n\nMisc\n\nThere would be no necessity to use MAAS but individuals will need to understand the fee market to send a confirmable txn. There might even be miners that only confirm their own MAAS customers transactions, and other miners that are public. This could slow confirmation of "naked" txns (txns with no MAAS, my made up term). Online market places would partner with a MAAS, or provide their own, which would be a new emergent competitive angle. \n\nSomething like this will definitely accompany a fee market, but it could turn out to look much different then my description.

These devices use dedicated hardware to protect your coins and will not be compromised even if your computer is hacked.\n\n\nWhy do you use bitcoin?\n\n> Because I truly believe that digital currency is the future for the world and I want to be a part of that process. Not just that, but after several years of involvement I\'ve discovered hundreds of ways to use it in ways I could never have imagined with cash. One of my issues of the past few years is that I don\'t have the self-control to hold it because it\'s so easy to move.\n\nHow much bitcoin do you store at a given time?\n\n> Nice try NSA. None. Well... let me give it a shot. I usually have about $100 on my android device as a "hot wallet". These are funds that are very easy to access and I wouldn\'t be too upset if I lost it. My hot wallet is intended for ease of use and I burn through it every few days - then I replenish it from an exchange or a cold storage device.\n\nWhat do you usually purchase with bitcoin?\n\n> I like to support bitcoin related businesses. I am [addicted to these honey almond caramels](http://www.beesbros.com/btc-1-lb-bag-caramels.html). I buy my computer hardware, usually through newegg, and I do a lot on purse.io. I have trained my office staff to use bitcoin so we usually split the lunch tab with bitcoin. I give a lot away to friends and family. Since I\'ve been involved for several years many of my regular food service servers eagerly accept my (very generous) tips, which is fun for everyone.\n\nI do not own any bitcoin myself. Essentially I want to know if it is worth my time to consider using. If there is anything that I am misunderstanding or points i\'m missing please tell me.\n\n> Bitcoin is in the very dawn of its full potential - it\'s so early that it\'s difficult to imagine what it\'s capable of - and that\'s actually a problem.. when left to their own devices people tend to only imagine illegal activities.

Then what? Who knows, maybe the General Store is closed for the holidays and Farmer Bob thinks he can take advantage of this to get his invalid receipt accepted. This is, indeed, a problem. If the counterparty fails to properly monitor any attempts to close the account prematurely with an invalid receipt, and misses the deadline, they could definitely be defrauded. With the Lightning Network, there are multiple redundant systems running 24/7, which monitor the closing transactions submitted to the bitcoin network in order to make sure that this cannot happen.

Each time the two parties update their balance receipts, they both create a side contract; we will call this the \xe2\x80\x98claiming transaction\xe2\x80\x99. This is a signed contract which is only valid if the counterparty attempts to close the account fraudulently. That is the only condition where this contract holds true; in fair account closure, there is no need to readdress this claiming transaction. Within this side contract, the counterparty agrees to pay a small bounty to whoever presents the contract to the bank. By sharing this contract with a group of bounty hunters, there is an incentive for them to police any attempts to commit a fraudulent closing transaction on your account, because they would get rewarded for doing so.
