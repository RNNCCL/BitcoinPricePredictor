SatoshiLabs doesn't have any info on flash memory on their website, so it seems they're just using the on-board memory with their CPU (ARM Cortex M3). This is outside the scope of this leak in particular, but at this point, I'm assuming the NSA has compromised just about everything we use on a hardware level (and every level above that), including Intel, AMD, and ARM CPUs. They've been doing this shit since at least the early 1990s, starting with the Clipper chip at the latest. Snowden said if a device is ever connected to a network, the NSA owns it, and I see no reason to think he's not telling the truth at this point. Basically, we're rapidly approaching a 1984 scenario (Samsung even makes telescreens now), and I'm not sure what can be done to stop it.\n\nThat being said, I doubt the NSA is interested in stealing your BTC. Also, there's absolutely no such thing as perfect security when you're talking about nation-state level adversaries. They have essentially limitless funding (if Congress doesn't give them enough money, just sell crack to the inner cities or guns to the cartels). It's not something I'd really worry about on a personal level unless you're funding ISIS or running a darknet market right now. It's terrifying what these fucking traitors will be able to do as Moore's Law continues to hold true, though.

If your phone is rooted and unlocked, they can steal it, yes. If it is locked, or unlocked and not rooted, they won't be able to get to it.

They are needed if you lose your phone so it can restore your data to a new phone. \n\nThat backup seed would be needed if you lose your phone AND airbitz goes does.

To encrypt your keys on your phone so that a stolen phone won\'t have accessible, unencrypted keys\n2. To synchronize the encrypted data with our peer to peer servers. Yes that does mean data leaves your phone, but only after it has been encrypted by your password, not ours. Neither we, nor even any MITM attacker, will have ANY capability of decrypting your data. In fact, so much of your account is hashed and encrypted, that we cannot even associate your hashed username/password to the encrypted data-store.\n\nNote that even if all Airbitz servers go down, you can still login into your account with your username & password. Try it. Go into airplane-mode then login (not PIN login) with your full username & password. That will simply decrypt the data on your phone.\n\nIn addition, just because we utilize a username & password doesn\'t mean all communications go through our servers. To send or receive a transaction, the Airbitz app communicates directly with peer to peer nodes running open source Libbitcoin. Unlike Mycelium in which ALL bitcoin network communications go through ONLY their closed source, proprietary servers.\n\nThe reason we\'ve chosen a username/password is because it is by far the most familiar experience that 99% of the population is accustomed to and won\'t be alienated by. I\'ve come across tons of new users that get lost as soon as they\'re told to write down a 12 word passphrase and keep that secure. Then to "login" to another device, they have type in those same 12 words! \n\nAirbitz also allows users to tag transactions with rich meta data such as Payee, Category, and Notes. All of which is local, client-side encrypted for full privacy and then synchronized with the peer-to-peer data servers and then onto the user\'s other devices. All of which is enabled by the username & password for authentication and encryption.\n\nWe\'ve effectively mimic\'ed a mobile banking app to make bitcoin \'feel\' familiar to users while still retaining the core principles of decentralization, privacy, and financial autonomy.\n\nPlease see our FAQ which helps outline some of these details  https://airbitz.co/go/faq': 1, "How to restore access using backup seed if your server is down?

So that coffee your friend might buy might end up showing as not received by the merchant for an hour.\n\nIn our minds, it's better to not be able to spend the funds immediately, but when you can spend them, you have a high chance that they'll be accepted.

Additionally, a good chunk of my mobile wallet transactions involve showing bitcoin to newcomers.

Consider the average number of inputs per transaction for an address, this could be used to help classify user behavior. \n\nAlso, the API exposes our internal address clustering which was inspired by the research/work of Michele Spagnuolo on [BitIodine](https://github.com/mikispag/bitiodine).  Given an address of interest, this allows you to find other addresses that are probably under the control of the same entity. \n\nThere are some scaling limitations with the current blockchain API's.

The fact that Datastore abstracts away the indexing and storage for a NoSQL store is pretty amazing.  As long as the number of index entries for an object isn't crazy you can replicate most of the indexing features that something like ElasticSearch gives you, but now you don't have to manage two different services such as ElasticSearch for your indexing and something like Cassandra or Hadoop for your storage.  The only thing I don't like about Datastore is that if you want to connect directly to Datastore you have run from either GAE or GCE and those have two separate client libraries :/ .  If you want to connect from an outside server you have to go through a [Remote API](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/java/tools/remoteapi) proxy hosted on App Engine which is yet another separate client library.\n\n* **Mysql:** To distribute the processing for clustering addresses I needed an ACID compliant database to prevent any issues when two separate jobs are trying to merge the same cluster.  We also use it to store Bitcoin network peer information and the relationship of which ones we are connected to.\n\n* **Distributed Batch Stream Processing:** We needed a distributed processing framework for aggregating address transaction data, address clustering, and updating entries in Datastore.  I generally dislike when I see engineers reinventing the wheel or maintaining a not invented here philosophy, but I ended up developing my own framework on top of Redis and Zookeeper instead of using Storm or Spark.  I've used Storm in the past and I really enjoyed the software abstraction, but when it came to trying to deploy a cluster with the existing tools and my Java 8 codebase it was  a nightmare.  So rather than risk running into the same operational nightmare with managing a Hadoop cluster for Spark,  I went with writing something that I knew I could easily maintain.  Eventually, I would really like to try to open source it.  I think its key feature is its abstraction that handles redistributing time consuming jobs for you.  Often I run into the problem of being unable to efficiently know ahead of time if a job needs to process a couple of items or millions of items and this feature solves that problem nicely.\n\n* **Redis:**  In addition to the stream processing, we use it for tracking API request rates by IP and user key, and keeping track of valid authentication nonces all in a single pipelined request.  For future projects we are using it to keep track of unconfirmed transactions and detecting double spent outputs.\n\n* **Firebase:** Gotta love firebase, it has saved us a ton of development time for managing user accounts.": 1, 'Is this open source?': 6, "no it's not open source, but feel free to test the API during the free beta program and we will also have a free tier in the future": 2, 'What does this offer over something like [Toshi](http://blog.coinbase.com/post/97671295752/introducing-toshi-an-open-source-bitcoin-node) ?': 1}, ('BitCoin / FX currency Exchange', 0): {}, ('If while sending to a Bitcoin address, you accidentally send to a Litecoin or Whatever coin address, would the coin bounce back ?', 2): {'Cool, thank you :D': 3, "Just a minor clarification: I think /u/usrn meant that the Bitcoin protocol won't allow you to send to addresses that aren't properly formed Bitcoin addresses, so Litecoin or Whatever-coin addresses wouldn't qualify.
