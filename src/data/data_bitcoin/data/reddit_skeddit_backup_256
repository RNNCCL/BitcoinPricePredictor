The truth is probably less interesting. People in China with enough yuan to matter have ways of getting it abroad anyway - see property bubbles in Sydney, Vancouver, San Fran, and New York for starters - so I have a hard time believing that everyday, normal Chinese people are buying bitcoin as a hedge against a drop in the CNYUSD. I\'m not claiming there aren\'t problems in China. In fact the property boom is very reminiscent of Iran, which saw large capital outflows (and property bubbles in the US in LA, among other places) just before the Ayatollah came to power in 1979.

I don\'t even know if counterfeiting casino chips would get you in much trouble by law enforcement -- unless there are laws that specifically apply to it (e.g., http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NRS/NRS-4...l#NRS465Sec080 ). \n\nThere was a discussion about an idea to use national currency as the "token" for a bitcoin-backed asset.   A specific serial number of currency/bank note could be redeemed for a specific amount of bitcoin.    It would get specially marked to know that it had these bitcoins attached, but otherwise is used like cash.   That way you have the national government\'s law enforcement involved if there was counterfeiting.   \n\nhttp://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=305590.msg3443357#msg3443357\n\nOne risk in doing that is the issuer of the currency (the national government) could simply do the counterfeiting themselves of some of these specific serial numbers and these notes become worthless overnight.   But it was an interesting approach.': 1, 'Nearly all national governments benefit from the issuance of specie and notes (due to seigniorage).   They go after nearly all private issuance (e.g., e-gold, Liberty Dollar) with the exception of some community currency which don\'t significantly displace or threaten to usurp the national currency.\n\n> An enterprising company, effectively acting as a bank, would acquire a store of Bitcoin, then create their own currency product for their reserves: private tokens representing various quantities of Bitcoin, which they would sell to consumers. These tokens, coins or notes, initially sold with a premium above their stated value, would then be redeemable with the firm for the given quantity of Bitcoin.\n\nThe flaw with that idea is that issuing such a "note" subjects the issuer to money transmitter and securities regulations.   The holders of these notes cannot access the asset represented by (i.e., being backed by) the note without the cooperation of the issuer.  This makes censorship (on who can redeem the notes for the asset) and corruption (reversal of a transaction or confiscation of the asset) trivially easy for the regulator.  \n\nThere\'s some pointers to other info here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_currency\n\nSo issuing a "bearer note" backed by some commodity held by a centralized body (other than the national government) is probably a non-starter.\n\nNow there is some innovation where the private key accompanies the token or note so that the item does not require the participation of the issuer.  Casascius was doing that but the premium (above the value of the bitcoin held on the coin) was high and for not registering as a money service business they essentially got shut down by the regulator.\n\nI like what PaperSafe is doing ( http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1049428.0 ) -- the encrypted private key shown publicly with a decryption secret protected by a tamper-evident scratch-off seal.  This would seem to allow the item to circulated yet it could then be redeemed by any bearer (which destroys the note such that it no longer circulates).   There are a number of tactics that can be employed to defeat the anti-tampering and as such we don\'t yet have a tamper-resistant paper walled used as a circulating money.\n\n\nIt\'s quite possible some other approach would work.   It would probably require matching some unrelated innovation to the concept of a bearer instrument (token, or note) allowing it to circulate until the secret is accessed, then it shows as being tampered and no longer circulates.': 1, 'Thanks for the comments. Preventing counterfeiting would definitely be a private concern of businesses creating these tokens - I imagine the first and most important line of defense would be similar anti-counterfeiting techniques used in modern fiat currency tokens.': 1, "Here's another approach.  \n\nA sequence of paper wallets, each having a change address that points to the next wallet in the sequence.

The merchant creates the spend transaction and sends the change to the Bitcoin address for the next paper wallet in the sequence (which the merchant doesn't have access to.)\n\nThe customer has to trust that the merchant really did spend the change to correct change address, though.    Text message notifications by some third party could provide that transaction feedback so that the customer doesn't leave the store without getting the proper change.\n\nhttp://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=92969.msg1030972#msg1030972\n\nThen add in the capability of BIP 32 HD wallet makes this idea even more useful -- as if the user also has a smartphone the same funds can be spent with an app as well.": 3, '> Nearly all national governments benefit from the issuance of specie and notes... They go after nearly all private issuance.\n\nAs I mentioned, Bitcoin can offer a "safe harbour" - not complete protection to firms which displease the government, but because states cannot stop Bitcoin, it provides opportunities which attract firms to try and enter these different markets. Among other things there is some protection in numbers, and it also helps for these firms that they are not directly competing with the  government by trying to declare their tokens inherently value, but just offering representations of an existing commodity.\n\nIn general, the whole point of Bitcoin is to take away these prerogatives from governments, and that is a slow process, Bitcoin is just the thin end of the wedge, we also need a lot of businesses pushing the limits of what governments will accept, as well as popular dissatisfaction with government actions and subsequent resistance.\n\nSo I would say that this objection is not a deal-breaker, especially looking forward in a Bitcoin-success scenario, where governments suffer a lot of damage as their debasement revenues and their control over financial systems are progressively destroyed.\n\n> The flaw with that idea is that issuing such a "note" subjects the issuer to money transmitter and securities regulations. \n\nCompanies going into this market would definitely want to challenge such a point in court. Why is what they do any different from the government issuing untraceable physical currency? It isn\'t, so government attempts to crack down on it are hypocritical. One cannot expect long-term democratic support for hypocritical government behaviour.\n\n> This makes censorship (on who can redeem the notes for the asset) and corruption (reversal of a transaction or confiscation of the asset) trivially easy for the regulator. \n\nAnyone who wants to use Bitcoin for serious amount of money or for non-state-authorised activities would not be interested in relatively expensive representative tokens. This idea is primarily targeted for day-to-day financial activities for people who are highly accustomed to physical currency.\n\nFurthermore, even if you did have problems with redeeming your coins, laundering would be dead simple, just sell your coins to someone who has a clean record. People who want to launder "dirty" money are a) not stupid and b) highly motivated. They will find lots of ways.\n\n> allowing it to circulate until the secret is accessed, then it shows as being tampered and no longer circulates.\n\nIt\'s good that people are experimenting with forms of circulatable stored private keys, but ultimately there will always be a serious validation problem with such tokens limiting their usefulness for a simple physical currency alternative. A business which might issue such tokens could never guarantee they would honour the stated values if the private keys were secretly extracted (this is impossible, because the only way for an honest user to discover tampering is to break the tampering seals, and then how can it be proved who spent from the private key?)\n\nWith a representative token issued by a firm, redeemability is guaranteed by the firm, and validation is the same question as we have with current fiat tokens: does this look like a genuine token? If they are genuine, or look genuine enough, the firm will honour it, and then it is the firm\'s problem to make sure their tokens are hard to counterfeit.': 1}, ('Buying/selling bitcoins to make a little extra money?', 23): {"this is called speculation.

Earlier it was more like Open Transactions from what I understand - islands of local Ripple webs of trust. I think they also were the first ones to push the gateway model - the Classis was more focused on peer-to-peer trust, rather than gateway-customer trust. They might've also had one of the earliest distributed, multi-currency exchanges on a crypto network, plus their atomic multi-currency swaps are still pretty much unseen in the crypto world. Addition of XRP is spam prevention on the network, hardly innovative.
