Why wasn\'t I informed of this?"](http://www.condenaststore.com/-sp/A-billion-is-a-thousand-million-Why-wasn-t-I-informed-of-this-New-Yorker-Cartoon-Prints_i9417003_.htm)\n\n---\n\nSo, carefully picking the level of scale of our units to result in numbers within the range of the total "money supply" of a typical currency (such as the USDollar), we could make the following statements:\n\n- Most currencies have a total "money supply" measured in **"tens of trillions"** of units.\n\n- There will only be a maximum of 21 trillion Bits in the total "money supply" of the Bitcoin currency.\n\n- 1 million Bits currently costs less than 350 USDollars.\n\nSo in some psychological sense, this gives a rough estimate for how much a person might invest if they wanted to speculate on becoming a "millionaire" in this new currency - ie, if they wanted to control a "million" units of a currency whose total "money supply" is measured in the "tens of trillions" of units, such as most currencies are today.\n\nSo, at current prices, it only costs 350 USDollars to become a future "millionaire" in this currency.\n\nAgain, the only way the mathematics and economics (and psychology) works out in familiar, suggestive terms like this is if you use "Bits" (and not "Bitcoins") to denominate the total "money supply".\n\nUsing "Bits" (not "Bitcoins") is the only way to get a total "money supply" measured in the ranges of "tens of trillions" of units (Bits), as most currencies are today.\n\n**TL;DR: Total "money supply" is traditionally and most easily discussed using "tens of *trillions* of units" (eg: 21 *trillion* Bits) - not "tens of *millions* of units" (21 *million* Bitcoins).**\n': 1, '21 million sounds far better than 21 trillion.

Clearly, a LOT more. Higher growth = higher volatility.\n\nAnd there is no evidence that lower volatility increases growth on an objective measurement like transactions per day, just anecdotal complaints (or more often: second hand accounts of reports of complaints) about "I don\'t accept Bitcoin because it\'s too volatile". I would wager good money that in the hypothetical scenario where Bitcoin was locked at a perfectly stable value the vast majority of merchants with that complaint would find some other excuse not to accept Bitcoin (eg. "It\'s not practical", "No one would even buy anything with it", "It\'s too heavily associated with drugs" etc. etc.).\n\nThe real reason they don\'t want to accept Bitcoin is because it isn\'t a compelling use case for them yet, and that\'s fine, so our task is to make it so by making Bitcoin so popular, simple and profitable that they don\'t have a choice rather than wasting time on trivial distracting excuses that can\'t be "fixed" anyway.\n\n> they don\'t use bitcoin to pay for their own costs, and this breaks the "full circle" that we want to happen.\n\nOf course, in an ideal world, a closed loop economy with tons of merchants is great.  But we\'ve got to get there somehow, and in all honesty the volatility worries of some non-critical merchants (the kind who want to convert back to fiat in the first place) are small potatoes.\n\nIt\'s much, much, much more important that there is a sizeable monetary and user (aka investor, hodler, speculator whatever you want to call them) base for Bitcoin than that there\'s a lot of merchants.  If enough people want to pay with Bitcoin, merchants will accept it where as if every merchant wanted to take Bitcoin it would be useless if no-one had any Bitcoin to buy stuff with.\n\nAcquiring that larger monetary and user base is going to take a lot of... you guessed it... volatility.  So volatility really isn\'t a big problem.\n\nI recommend reading the articles at the Nakamoto Institute for a better idea of how this all works, I thought they were all really good.  Here\'s some good ones to start on related to this topic of volatility and improvement of the Bitcoin economy:\n\nhttp://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/i-love-bitcoins-volatility/\n\nhttp://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/im-hoarding-bitcoins-and-no-you-cant-have-any/\n\nhttp://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/how-to-market-bitcoin/': 1, '[WHEEEEEEEEEE](http://www.brainlesstales.com/images/misc/bitcoin-roller-coaster.gif)': 6, 'Rocket fuel is cheaper now than in 2013, so we should make it to Mars maybe.

Apparently because mining was sufficiently profitable so that it remained at least marginally profitable after the halving as well. We can hope for a significant bitcoin price increase just before the halving, but I fear that there is a glut of miners waiting to go online if the price rockets, so the profits will remain marginal.\n\nThis could all be solved if the block reward algorithm were changed so that it smoothly and exponentially dropped, say, by a very small amount on every block.

The profit-driven will mine right up to the reward halving and then shut down (to save on electricity costs) until the difficulty adjusts accordingly.

Which puts the next halving even further out.\n\nSo the main hope is that the price will be high enough that miners are still profitable at 1/2 the reward.

Also, transaction fees might rise to encourage miners to keep mining until the difficulty adjusts.\n\nSo, yes, interesting point /u/ShatosiMakanoto': 2, "The Efficient Market Hypothesis would suggest the price will go up gradually as the halvening approaches.
