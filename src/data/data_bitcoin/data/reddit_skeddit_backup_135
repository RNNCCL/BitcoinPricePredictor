People in this camp say processing power, network bandwidth and storage have and will continue to improve and thus we can and should increase the speed limit to reflect that.\n\n**The other camp wants to do it in a far more complex way, by essentially improving bitcoin so it can handle more transactions while consuming the same or less resources.**\n\nThey\'re saying that while it\'s true that processing power etc. has improved, there could still be negative consequences if we increase the limit today. Increasing the limit increases the system requirements of running the bitcoin core software (= a fully validating, transaction relaying node/wallet, not your mobile bitcoin app), which would make it more expensive and thus would disincentivize running one.

It is just a cost.\n\nIncreasing the number of transactions per second also increases the bandwidth and cpu power required to run a node. The fear is that more people will stop running a node out of cost considerations and Bitcoin becomes dependent on a too small number of nodes. At that point Bitcoin has become centralized.\n\nThe number of nodes has been continuously dropping despite increased adoption of Bitcoin.

This in turn can cause centralization, which means governments eventually can take over the control of the network, and Bitcoin will become a failed project.  Increased fees is a good thing as miners eventually have to get their income from fees alone in the future, and there are technologies being developed to transfer bitcoins on the outside of the current limit.\n\nThe "bigblockers" claim that the limit can be lifted without any problems and that it preferably should have been raised already.  The user experience and merchant experience will be horrible when we hit the capacity limit, this will cause a major drop in the BTC value and it will prevent adoption, possibly ruining the whole Bitcoin project.\n\nTo add to the pain, everyone needs to upgrade software before the limit can be safely increased, those who didn\'t will find themselves on the wrong side of a so called "hard fork".  One basically needs to plan ahead and roll out a software update saying i.e. "at 2017-01-01, increase the limit".  The smallblockers thinks the "hard fork" is dangerous, the bigblockers are fuming that we still can\'t even agree to lift it - the update should have been rolled out in early 2015, and the limit should have been increased already now.\n\nI\'ve tried to keep this neutral, simplified, to-the-point and accurate, but please comment if I failed at any of those :-)': 32, 'No, the sole purpose of the limit was to prevent spam transactions.

This has been a significant problem in the past when fees were zero because we were far from the block size limit. The other likely problem is that after a few more halvings the block reward will be too small to make it worth mining bitcoins and so the security of the entire network will be diminished. Transaction fees are intended to replace those block rewards.\n\nOne of the current issues is that it has become apparent that there are some problems with the way bitcoin handles unconfirmed transactions (storing them in memory, no way to increase the fee after a transaction has been made, etc). These issues are being resolved rather than just blindly increasing the block size which eradicates the fees and reduces the incentive to mine.': 1, "There are two separate issues: pressure on miners and pressure on nodes.\n\nBigger blocks generally result in higher orphan rate for miners, which results in reduced profits. In theory, it should be about the same for all miners, however, miners can reduce their orphan rate (and thus increase profits) through tighter cooperation. More transactions => bigger blocks => more pressure to get together, merge, etc. Cooperating miners might also form a cartel and collectively control Bitcoin. E.g. they can discourage new miners from joining the network by not offering them optimization opportunities which they have within the group.\n\nBitcoin is structured in a way that every full node processes ever transaction. If nodes need process more transaction they need to consume more network bandwidth, CPU power, memory and storage. It might become unfeasible for ordinary people to run full nodes.\n\nWhy would we care about it? Well, the whole selling point of Bitcoin is that you don't need to trust anyone, you can run your own full node and verify all transactions directly.\n\nIf you use an SPV client, you have to trust miners. A miner can create a block with a bunch of fake payments and feed it to your SPV client and you'll know no better.\n\nAnother problem is that SPV clients usually rely on full nodes to feed them data, but if people will stop running full nodes we'll have very few of them and they won't be able to serve data to millions of SPV clients. In this case users will have to resort to use centralized services like Coinbase or blockchain.info.\n\nThere are technical solutions to each of this problems, but it will take years to research, develop and deploy them. People are asking to increase number of transactions per second _right now_, before the tech is improved.\n\nNote that we are talking about significant increase of number of transactions per second. Pretty much everybody agrees that 4x increase is OK with the current state of tech. but 10x increase is more debatable, not to mention 100x...": 2, 'And the former faction can only exist because of a group of charlatans who have convinced large numbers of redditors that such a thing is possible.': 2, 'Bitcoin is endlessly divisible (in theory, right now 8 decimals) -- there is no incompatibility.': 2, 'thanks /u/AgrajagPrime :-)': 3, 'Some people want the data size of transactions to grow by no more than 100kb/min and some people want 200kb/min or more.

It would be like Segregated Witness on steroids so it can also segregate transactions. Old nodes would continue to function as normal and would not see the >1mb transactions, but they can still transact to/from newer nodes and new addresses. \n\nAnd to make it even more complex, a blocksize increase can also be implemented with a soft hardfork. This means that older nodes would only see empty blocks and therefor cease to function. \n\nBoth these softforks have the advantage of not splitting the network in two. But like all Softforks they add unnecessary complications and cruft in the software and protocol. \n\nSmall blockers tend to favour Softforks, Bigblockers tend to favour Hardforks. \n\n\n': 2, "At the moment there is an upper cap of around 3 tx/second.  This means to make an entry on the blockchain soon it'll become a market to where transactions with higher fees take priority over the lower fee ones.\n\nThe alternative is to make the blocks bigger to allow more transactions per second.\n\n\nThere are two main issues I'm aware of.  Firstly both keeping 1mb block AND extending the blocks will still allow bitcoin function.  The difference is having a finite blocksize will change bitcoin's purpose from a general ledger to a settlement or larger value transaction one... i.e. we won't be seeing purchases of deep fried hamsters from Peru appearing there.  This forces new innovation/layers on top of bitcoin to handle these micro transactions and scale well.  E.g. Lightning network, sidechains, trusted wallet services, etc..  \n\nThe alternative is we keep growing the blocks and this can go on for quite some time HOWEVER it eventually will reach a limit based on diskspace issues, bandwidth issues, etc.. \nTherefore there is an argument to go through this upper bound pain limit now while bitcoin is small enough that it's not dramatic so it does become unlimited in uses via these additional layers.\n\n\nUltimately miners choose which option bitcoin will support (1Mb or allowing larger blocks).  Right now we're still in the 1Mb size because there is nothing to fix.\n\n\nIf bitcoin prices dramatically plummet miners may be inclinded to adopt XT or another branch that does allow bigger blocks so it really is a storm in a teacup.  It is trivial to increase the block size whenever the miners want.\n\n\nI want to see a solution/layer where 1,000,000 transactions per second in a trustless way can be sustainably achieved... without this it opens bitcoin up to an altcoin that will support it in the years to come.\nHolding onto the 1Mb bound to force this solution now and testing what happens when an upper bound is reached is sensible to do in this experiment before big money is riding on it.\n\n\nEither way bitcoin will scale massively soon.": 5, 'That seems about as unbiased and neutral as it gets - good job.': 4, "Users will be incentivised once miners don't pick up transactions with too little fees.

": 1, "> A fee market will develop anyway once the block reward becomes too small.\n\nWhy would the users be incentivised to pay fees by the lowering of the block reward? They won't.

However, blocks will still be mined by the few remaining miners and so all those free transactions will continue to be confirmed but with reduced hashrate and security.\n": 1, '> But that seems counter to what other people are claiming, in that smallblockers want to prevent an increase in blocksize because they want to retain control. \n\nI believe that is a misunderstanding.\n\nThere are lots of accusations and conspiracy theories flying around.  Let me present one of the conspiracy theories.\n\nMost of the core developers are employed by Blockstream, and Blockstream is hoping to do commercial success with their projects "lightning network" and "sidechains".  Both those projects aim to take transactional traffic away from the main blockchain.  One of the conspiracy theories is that the core team wants to cripple the block chain to be able to pull more traffic over to their solutions (and hence control the traffic).\n\nPersonally I believe there may be some grains of truth in it, but ...\n\n* Bitstream needs a strong bitcoin, if they "cripple" the blockchain they will be sawing off the branch they\'re sitting on.\n* There is business value in sidechains and the lightning network even if there is plenty of room in the blocks and very low transaction fees.\n* I believe sidechains and lightning is implemented as open source, Bitstream can never fully control it, I believe their business model is to offer consulting and tailor-made solutions.': 1, "When you say 'increasing number of transactions per second will further increase pressure to centralize' why would that put pressure to centralize it?

The issue with mining is that you have to do complex calculations on potentially millions of nonces in order to mine a block, so the most powerful machines will most often win, and those will be owned by a small number of entities who either have enough money to do it, or aren't burdened by building and health codes to make building a cheap datacenter impractical. \n\nWhat you really want is a system where everyone acts as a miner and each node is handed a list containing a limited number of nonces to try.

So many of the participants really want the value of bitcoin to go up and get rich quick that they are incentiviced to downvote anyone who doubts the current decisions of the status quo.\n\nThen I realized I can easily by-pass the censorship by sending private messages, there is nothing the status quo can do about that. All I want to do it try to inspire people like me to find the information they need to make a rational informed decision.\n\nupvote or downvote this post?\n\nBe honest to yourself, don't downvote because you don't like a person.

So to think they're above manipulating bitcoin is folly.\n": 5, "> effectively raising the blocksize\n\nHow is that a lie? Did I say that they're raising the max block size cap? No. \n\nIt's been reported as resulting in around twice as many transactions being able to fit in a block. Thus in effect it results in a capacity increase without changing the current maximum size of our blocks. If we raise the max to 2MB it would provide a similar amount of transactions as a 4MB block would without segwit, 4MB as 8MB and so on.

Problems are what continually make Bitcoin stronger and more censorship resistant. The longer Bitcoin survives in the face of overwhelming hostility and attacks, external and internal, the greater the trust in it as a currency grows. How many times has Bitcoin been proclaimed dead? Each time its reputation as something that is going to be around for a long time solidifies. \n\nBitcoin emerged stronger from all of this, with some really hopeful changes to core coming, segregated witness which will not only address the issue of scalability in the short run but will also promote more innovation. She proved that she has a community that was able to work together to move her forward in an organic, non-hierarchical way, to increase both scalability without compromising decentralization, nor by suffering through a hard fork or by giving control over to Hearn. The community has agreed to give time to explore longer term solutions like LN and overall resilience has been maintained. I\'m really happy with were I see Bitcoin going.   \n\nYes Bitcoin is ugly. It is like a weed, a virus, or a sewer rat (to use Andreas\'s analogy). The problems with it are glaring and obvious, like a war-scarred face you can see its turmoil, but that turmoil makes it strong. As an organic, open system, it adapts and grows to new threats in ways that traditional companies cannot. \n\nThere are always problems in the Bitcoin space. The latest was what I consider to have been a massive internal political attack on Bitcoin. It was a necessary attack because it demonstrated that Bitcoin is a political phenomena, and that politics is very much a part of its security model. Although developers like Peter Todd have been arguing that Bitcoin was political for some time, no one real believed it until now. This is not a weakness in Bitcoin, it is just a strength that we have yet to get our minds wrapped around. \n\nAnd obviously the primary instigator of the block size schism, Mike Hearn, is going out with a suicide bombing, presumably hoping to take Bitcoin down with him. Many people disagree with me about that, but that\'s how I see it. His diatribe against Bitcoin was extremely negative and I think the fact that Mike went to work for the international banking cartel on his way out the door demonstrates whats really going on here. Contrary to this being a basis for more fear, this actually marks the end of the Bitcoin Civil War in my opinion, and Mike is merely conceding defeat . . . at least for now. \n\nBut overall, none of this has been bad for Bitcoin in the long run. Anytime flaws in the system are discovered, this is only a good thing for a system that is constantly learning to adapt and evolve through potential threats and attacks. Ignoring potential threats works well for banks and companies that require optimistic investors, but for Bitcoin recognizing threats is a key to her survival. The recent threat was a political threat from within, in which many in the community wanted to hand control over to someone whose agenda -- given that he is working for the international bankers -- is dubious at best. The recent threat attempted to scare the community into doing something drastic. It was the first real internal attack on Bitcoin we\'ve seen, but we survived it. Now the question is how does Bitcoin learn from this attack and adapt, for politics will always be a part of Bitcoin\'s future from here on. How does Bitcoin embrace this reality?
