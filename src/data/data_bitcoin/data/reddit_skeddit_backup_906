Really, a lot of my angst and the source of my all caps rant was really driven by a more elementary understanding of the benefits of code decentralization: the ability of having competent, yet competing developers within the bitcoin ecosystem vetting and critiquing each others work in a public fashion.  I really believe that the trust that is placed by the community in the Satoshi client project and also the Bitcoin Foundation, is the most pressing problem faced by us right now.\n\n/u/changetip 1 mBTC': 7, 'Well, here are the facts as I currently thought they were..\n\nI\'ve specifically brought this issue up with you, specifically, before in our last discussion about the testnet fork from the btcd-created block. You didn\'t correct me then.\n\nYou can find my un-edited-since-then comment where I mention it to you here:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/26h3o8/btcd_beta_announcement/chub4sp\n\nThe user came in complaining about a segfault, described here:\n\nhttp://sprunge.us/LRQh\n\nBased on a patch, described here:\n\nhttp://sprunge.us/WGEF\n\nIn total, if what he said in that as you say out-of-context IRC chat is correct, he has done the following:\n\n* Added runtime.GC() in five locations\n* Turned on runtime.MemProfileRate = 1\n* *DECREASED* the maxOrphanTransactions size by a factor of 50\n* Increase three timeout variables to extra minutes\n* Tried to run btcd on an OpenBSD host using a ports-sourced pkg_add. That is, he initially claimed he was not himself patching his Go runtime.\n\nAccording to the 5.5 ports tree, the following patches are applied to lang/go version 1.2, in summary:\n\n(from http://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/5.5/ports.tar.gz)\n\n* linker directive\n* increased timespec struct size (x6)\n* instructions for go to call in assembly some timing routines and the kevent syscall (setitimer, usleep, etc) (x2)\n* A slightly modified route_bsd.go\n* a getdirentries() func (x3)\n* A patch for OpenBSD syscall return errors which expands known error constants (x2)\n* An OpenBSD-specific sysctl struct patch primarily dealing with "how to talk to OpenBSD sysctl"\n* An expanded syscall list for OpenBSD (x2)\n\nWhen ports/ updated to go 1.3, all patches except one went away, because the patches were on cursory examination accepted verbatim into Go 1.3 upstream.\n\nSo, are you attributing one of the above patches to a failing Go runtime.GC() segfault? Or can you dispel this supposed misconception of mine by telling me of your discovery that the user was lying?\n\nI, I suspect unlike people who usually argue with you, would be happy to be corrected and will gladly update my opinions with corrected information and data, and I will never claim that btcd segfaults with simple runtime.GC() patches again, if you can honestly tell me this is so, especially if there a bugtracker somewhere where this bug was tracked, analyzed, explained and permanently corrected. Heck, I\'ll even apologize and correct my entire past commenting history in here. I still won\'t agree that a mining alt is a good idea, but I\'ll certainly gladly drop this issue into the trashbin.\n\nI\'ll reiterate: I am not against alternate implementations. I have stated before that I am explicitly *pro* alternative clients. I myself run a number of heavily-patched versions of bitcoind, and I will be running a number of btcd in remote servers. I think the existence of bitcoinj is a boon to the client ecosystem, as are the various relay clients, seednodes, SPV clients, and other implementations I\'m extremely supportive of.\n\nI also fail to grasp your reasoning as to how *additional* implementations that, as you seem to imply, increase forking risk, are better for the ecosystem, nor how mining implementations which increase forking risk strengthen the system against new versions of bitcoind..? Perhaps I\'m misunderstanding your vocabulary. It happens.\n\n(edited for list formatting)': 1, ">The program is fast, and the code is gorgeously readable, tested to all hell, and documented back from.\n\nhttps://github.com/conformal/btcd\n\nCan't find the test suite anywhere.

Any ideas where to look?": 7, 'http://www.reddit.com/user/ceo-of-bitcoin': 1, 'How does Conformal make money?': 4, 'Ah, thanks for clarifying!': 1, 'I didn\'t respond to it, because these long posts are quite time consuming and I\'m typically extremely busy writing code that contributes to the ecosystem.  I don\'t really like to spend time engaging in these debates, because it takes away from time I could be using to that end.  For example, currently I\'m working on a highly secure and scalable wallet address manager that, to my knowledge, is the first one to offer encryption of public data.  It\'s certainly the first one in Go if not in general.  However, instead of working on that right now, I\'m on here responding to this.\n\nAnyways, back on to the issue at hand, the problem is you *seem to be* intentionally wording things in the most negative light possible.  For example, given the exact knowledge of the issue you\'ve posted in your reply with the facts as you currently believed them to be, rather than saying there was a bug at one point 3 months ago where a user was running a modified version of the code, you say things like "mysterious" and "innocent", insinuate it is a common occurrence, and *appear* to take every opportunity to latch on to any possible negative thing you can to spread FUD about btcd.  That is the perception that myself, and others who have sent me private messages, have gleaned from your posts.  For example, here is a quote from one pm that I received from somebody (not a part of the Conformal team) that said "10:37 <******> who is this midmagic?  he has a serious hard on for btcd..."\n\nMeanwhile in the same time frame (since May 27th as shown in the linked pastie) there have been no less than 7 crashes reported on Bitcoin Core (including the most recent one with getutxos) which I have not seen you going on every thread about Bitcoin Core posting about.\n\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4242\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4345\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4516\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4628\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4703\n* https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues/4774\n\nRegardless of any of that, I\'ll repeat, I have no problems whatsoever stating that btcd has bugs.  It most certainly does, just like every other piece of software on the planet.  I\'m actually quite happy when one is reported because it means we can fix it.\n\nNo, the user was not lying and I did not say he was.  I said that it was a mix of several modifications between the Go-runtime, the kernel, and the application itself that led to the crash.  When I said "I hope you don\'t honestly believe the garbage collection thing", I was referring to the way you worded it to insinuate that Go (and by extension, btcd) has an unstable garbage collector.  I\'ve asked the user who reported the initial issue to clarify, so we can clear up any misunderstandings.\n\nIn regards to the additional implementations, Justus hit the nail on the head with his response.  I can\'t state it any better than that.  The mere existence of alternative implementations (note I\'m not specifically referring to any one in particular here) has already led to several positive things such as greatly increased test coverage in the Bitcoin Core JSON test data itself, a pull-tester block acceptance comparison tool, work toward separating the core consensus script logic into a library, etc.\n\nSo, let\'s start with a clean slate.  I\'m glad to see that you\'re *pro* alternative clients.  Your actions on the btcd threads have led me to believe otherwise, but I\'m happy to be wrong about your stated motivations.\n\n\n': 1, 'sorry no disbelief, just a joke around the fact people think bitcoin has a ceo and is a company and an illustration about the power of the decentralized nature of it': 3, "I sense a bit of disbelief in your post.

The issue I have with it is it\'s a bunch of really trivial patches, the bug\'s evaluation and analysis was either dropped on the floor or is happening in private, and that is evidence that btcd, or at least its environment, is currently more fragile than your cheerleader buddies here and the OP are technically capable of evaluating.\n\nI dunno. Maybe my opinion isn\'t so informed? You did flatly state originally that I was plain factually incorrect. Pretty sure I\'m not, but maybe right?\n\nYou probably shouldn\'t let rando cheerleader speak with your mouth, though, because he\'s saying that your new mining software does increase forking risk, but that you *predicate the safety of the system as a whole* on btcd not only being superior software, but *also completely supplanting Bitcoin Core* while letting users deal with the fallout risks of the transition period.\n\nThat\'s unfortunate that you decided to respond at all to what you think is FUD, but then call it too time consuming to deal with when it turns out it\'s not just rando anti-cheerleader FUD after all. But I do appreciate your implied stance reversal: so, then, you haven\'t actually analyzed (or perhaps even reproduced) a segfaulting bug after a user patched your code? I personally wouldn\'t liken a runtime.GC() to a free(nil) in C++. (I perhaps wrongly assume you meant free(NULL). Which does nothing.)\n\n* The bug hasn\'t been analyzed.

Maybe you know something I don\'t and just don\'t want to tell me because it takes too much time.)\n* You *don\'t* actually know whether the Go runtime was modified in a btcd-breaking way, but you stated it was.\n* You don\'t appear have a public bug URL where I can watch the progress, discussion, hypotheses, analyses, fixes, or test-cases which address this bug specifically.\n* The reported bug was May 15, about three months ago.\n* You don\'t actually know whether the OS kernel itself is a source of the problem, but you stated it was.\n* You don\'t actually know whether the trivial patch is the source of the problem, but you state it was, rather than just saying *"dunno, nobody can repro it, user disappeared, it\'s OpenBSD ports/, what do you expect of alpha software?"*\n\nIf it\'s such a waste of time dealing with me, why bother doing it? Who cares? Perhaps, as you imply, I\'m just some rando nobody, who\'s not really contributing meaningfully to the ecosystem.

I don\'t know how many times I have to repeat myself with you.  Every piece of software, *including* btcd has bugs. I have never claimed otherwise.\n\nThe problem here is you didn\'t pick a legitimate issue to hang your crusade on, and now you\'re trying to logic debate your way out of it instead of manning up and simply saying "my bad, I thought it was a legitimate bug that was still active".\n\n> when Conformal\'s own commits don\'t include the courtesy of a pointer to the original code \n\nReally?

The network effect is multiplied not only by the participants on one network, but by the number of different networks you can reach. Boom. No more division line between anything.\n\nTo me that\'s real progress and only strengthens the crypto ecosystem.\n\n>Most alt coins have at best a marginal increase in utility over Bitcoin\n\nThat\'s simply not the case and a simple glance at the alt/app coin ecosystem will show you why. Can you store files over the Bitcoin network? What are you going to do? Break up your file over a bunch of OP_RETURN commands? Forget it. It\'s not going to happen.\n\nTake [this "distributed dropbox" design for instance](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/16/secret-sharing-erasure-coding-guide-aspiring-dropbox-decentralizer/). Are the Bitcoin core devs going to implement this design? How? On what timeline? What other priorities do they have? What impact would implementing a storage system on top of a payment network have? That sounds just a bit silly. Go on the Bitcoin development community forums and ask them what they think about making Bitcoin a turing complete blockchain.

I cannot think of a single circumstance in which an additional person becoming a Bitcoin hodler would ever be bad for Bitcoin.\n\n> Also, Bitcoin IS an app coin. It just happens to be the first example of it. If they want to argue it has no monetary value, fine, but there is not some magical division line between Bitcoin and all the other alt/app coins around it.\n\nNo, there IS a magical division line between Bitcoin and all other alt/app coins.  That magical division line is:\n\n* First mover advantage.\n* Longest history and most proven security.\n* Largest mining network.\n* ... which leads into the network effect.  Bitcoin is ~17 times as big as all the other alt coins combined by market cap.  It really is in a category of its own.\n\nNote that the network effect applies not only to consumer adoption, but to merchant adoption, developer adoption, VC adoption, hardware adoption (when's the last time you heard about an alt coin Trezor?) etc.  Every single category Bitcoin will be magnitudes larger than any alt coin.\n\nAlso note that the Nakamoto Institute guys support alt coin development and experimentation for the purposes of pushing the limits of crypto, finding possible upgrades to Bitcoin etc. but just object to the promises that it'll be a good investment or actually have monetary value one day.\n\n> Take for example Storj, their coin is backed by the storage capacity it affords you on the network, it is much sounder money than Bitcoin in that regard, which is only backed by its capacity to store value.\n\nBitcoin is backed by the network effect (users, merchants, developers etc.), its mining network and security and its utility. That combination of things is unlikely to ever be challenged by any alt coin, unless it's as much better than Bitcoin as Bitcoin is than the USD (highly unlikely in the foreseeable future).  Most alt coins have at best a marginal increase in utility over Bitcoin, and a much much smaller mining network and network effect.\n\nBitcoin doesn't need to be backed by a claim to this or that (whether storage on a network or gold or government support), that's the beauty of it, there's no need for trust in someone to ever exchange it for anything else, it is valued just for it's potential to transfer to someone else.": 2, "That if they don't spend some Bitcoin, it will never reach $5000.": 0, 'there is also the test network. . . .': 1, 'Unless you can find discounts for purchases made with Bitcoin.

Different brands, different models, different applications.\n\nYou\'re absolutely right, Bitcoin does not need to do everything, nor can it.  However, it will be the only crypto with **monetary** value, which is exactly the point you make when discussing how other networks can interface with Bitcoin through payment networks.  That just means the other coin is going to be worth 0 or 1 satoshi or something while everyone constantly cashes out into Bitcoin, with only a tiny fragment of people buying that coin to use that network\'s service at the instant and only for the exact amount they actually need to use it.\n\nI should clarify when I said "Most alt coins have at best a marginal increase in utility over Bitcoin", I should probably have said "Most alt coins have at best a marginal increase in utility over Bitcoin **as a form of money**", I thought you would have inferred that from this being the entire point of our discussion.\n\nRefer to this point again:\n\n> Also note that the Nakamoto Institute guys support alt coin development and experimentation for the purposes of pushing the limits of crypto, finding possible upgrades to Bitcoin etc. but just object to the promises that it\'ll be a good investment or actually have monetary value one day.\n\nApp coins may exist, and may be useful on their network, but it\'s delusional to think any of them will be a long-term store of value or have a trend that is anything approaching 0, unless you think that one coin would replace Bitcoin and all other cryptos.  \n\nThere\'s a lot of Linux Distros, but I\'m sure wherever you live there is not a lot of different currencies in common use, at most there would be two or three, and even then one would be dominant by a large user base above the others.': 1, "No I don't agree that hoarding ever discourages using Bitcoin.\n\nThe more people that 'hoard' (aka 'save'), the more demand there is for Bitcoin.  Price goes higher, liquidity increases.  If the demand for Bitcoin grows stronger because Bitcoin holders are even more determined not to spend it, than merchants are even MORE incentivised to accept it as it's obviously something a lot of people value. They're also incentivised to provide discounts to encourage people to spend (so the merchant can hodl), until they reach a point where the merchant and consumer make a transaction, as clearly there must be a floor above a price of '0'.\n\nThere's a lot more merchants accepting Bitcoin now that the price is ~$500 than when it was around ~$5.  That's because there's more people wanting to spend it, which is because there's even more people that want to hold it.\n\nSomeone can be a holder but not a spender, but can't be a spender without needing someone else to be a holder (whether the merchant, or another Bitcoiner via Coinbase or Bitpay).  The holders are the foundation of everything, spending and merchant adoption happens as a natural consequence.\n\nTheir intentions are to spread the ideals of freedom, and Bitcoin is a fantastic tool for doing that.  They were arguing that app coins don't and won't have any **monetary** value, for very good reasons.

Anyways, I do know that exchanges make projections about the size of the volume that will be going through their exchanges and they invest accordingly. Afterwards, they test out the software by simulating the load. Of course, the projections and tests itself are approximations, so they can't always pull it off without a hitch. But it's not completely untested either.\n\nI can also agree that spending should be encouraged, since I also tend to think that spending is important. The only thing is that people advocating spending seem to unconsciously follow the same behaviour patterns of governments and central banks and think that spending can be commanded or argued from a top down fashion and this behaviour is something I'm trying to caution against. They've been trying to influence us here in Europe through the news, trying to make us spend and needless to say, it hasn't been very succesful. That's because spending cannot be encouraged in a direct fashion during a crises. When you say to someone that they must spend, they will not spend unless on their terms. Each person has his own spending disposition. There are conditions under which they will spend and there are conditions where they will not do so. If you want them to spend, you must first create the conditions under which they will spend and indirect means are usually the most effective way to do that (more jobs being one of the most important criteria). In other words, to encourage spending you need to cultivate a suitable climate (or environment) instead of intervening directly. \n\nFor example, it makes no sense to encourage spending, when the majority of people are already at their limit of their spending disposition. Direct interventions, such as giving them a discount tends to not work in such situations (or only in a very limited fashion). People in the bitcoin space have invested all their savings early on and thus are already tapped out (like me) or they are investing some % of their salary monthly, in which case these people are also not in the position to increase their spending habits from usual. Indirect tactics ( I call that climate control) such as increasing bitcoin users or creating situations where the bitcoin price rises naturally (without short term manipulation) are much better ways to have an impact on spending.\n\n\n": 1, "The payment system has to be great, but what we're exchanging has to be wanted too as a medium of exchange.

Here is an example of Lyme Disease presenting as motor neuron disease. The antibiotics he took cured his Lyme Disease, not his ALS. Because he never had ALS. \n\nRight. I agree with you, it\'s not ALS, and actual ALS is probably 10 times less prevalent than doctors think it is. In other words, 9 out of 10 patients diagnosed with ALS are misdiagnosed. I\'ll stop calling ALS "Lyme" when doctors do the same.\n': 1, "95% of ALS cases are caused by Lyme disease, which is curable by long term antibiotics.\n\nThe only problem is that Lyme is much less interesting to Big Pharma than ALS (because they'd rather sell you patented drugs than generic antibiotics).": 0, 'Wrong, only 10% of ALS cases are genetic. The 90% remaining have no know cause (if you ask mainstream doctors). Lyme is both not reliably diagnosed, and not treated properly. [Several studies](http://www.als-cure.com/als-lyme/als-patients-infected-with-lyme-bacteria-borrelia-spirochetes/) have shown a strong correlation between ALS patients and Lyme infections.\n\nI know what I am talking about, my grandfather died from ALS last year. After he got diagnosed with ALS, I suggested to the doctor to run a blood test for Lyme. Like you, he laughed at me. We then tried 3 or 4 different doctors, they all had the same reaction. I finally found a doctor willing to order a test. Guess what? The test came back positive. They prescribed him a course of 3 weeks of antibiotics. After the second week, there was some very small signs of remission: he was able to move his arm which had been paralyzed for months. In the end, the disease was too advanced and the antibiotics course was too short to make a difference, nevertheless, all the neurologists claimed that any sign of remission was impossible in case of ALS, since it\'s a degenerative disease. They couldn\'t come up with any explanation.\n\nAlso, it\'s of course not a proof, but I spent hours reading various forums, and the number of people with ALS who also tested positive for a Lyme infection is extremely disturbing, for something that\'s supposed to be a very rare infectious disease.\n\nAlso, the bacteria responsible for Lyme is of the same family as the one responsible for Syphilis, which is know to cause neurological symptoms such as ALS.\n\nSure the Big Pharma theory is not the whole picture. There is also the pride of doctors who have been taught all their lives that ALS can\'t be cured, and have let hundreds of patients die already. They\'re not going to welcome the idea that they could have been saved with a simple course of antibiotics (the doctor who actually accepted to test for Lyme was the youngest we\'ve consulted with). There is also the fact that long term antibiotics are frowned upon (yet the WHO does recommend it for Syphilis). And there is also the fact that current tests for Lyme are know to have an extremely high rate of false negatives.\n\nI suggest you check the documentary "[Under our skin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVzXsKvN2ck)" about Lyme disease, if you want to have an idea of the extent of the epidemic.\n': 1, 'If you buy drugs on Silk Road, you owe this man a lot.
