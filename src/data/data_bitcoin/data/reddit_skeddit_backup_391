Well, an emergency hard fork would be quite traumatic.  The way to do a hard fork is to post the code *now*, but program it so that the limit is lifted only six months from now.  That way, everybody has six months to upgrade, and patch and test any idependent software that may depend on the max block size.   In particular, even if there is no consensus initially,  that six-month delay is enough for the minority side to realize that it lost, and had better switch to the majority before the fork actually happens.  That way the fork will be a non-event.\n\nIn conctrast, an emergency hard fork, activated on a short notice, will leave a significant fraction of clients, miners, and services still on the old chain. Since no one wants to do a "clean" fork (with incompatible transactions), there would be considerable confusion as transactions may be executed on both chains or on only one. \n\nMoreover, after the network becomes congested, it will take some time before everybody recognizes that the congestion is permanent and a block size increase is needed.  Have you read the description of what happens as congestion approaches?  It starts with temporary backlogs that appear when there is either a surge of incoming traffic, or a few extra-large block intervals and/or empty blocks; but then clear out after a couple of hours.  So there will be many arguing that the situation is not really bad, it was a fluke, etc..\n\nBoth those traffic jams before the fork and the confusion after the fork will probably stretch out for weeks or months.

The transfers are lightning fast, traceability has been questioned and no central bank is involved. Bitcoin - the most famous and widespread crypto currency - has gone to great setback during the last year. Strong speculation led to a bubble that began to burst in late 2013. A few months later suffered by far the largest trading site Mt Gox of a comprehensive theft. Despite this, Bitcoin is increasingly accepted as a value any. Even the harshest critics agree that kryptovalutorna is here to stay. What is the condition for Bitcoin right now? What other crypto-currencies compete? How will widespread use of crypto-currencies will affect the banks? How can financial markets using cryptographic currencies?

(30%-50% usually, 95%+ in certain situations) As I say in my [BIP](https://github.com/petertodd/bips/blob/bip-full-rbf-deadline/bip-full-rbf-deadline.mediawiki) why should the broader Bitcoin community accept those limitations given that the only big payment processors like Coinbase are able to have any success at preventing zeroconf doublespends?\n\nEqually, those processors do that by sybil attacking the Bitcoin network, and what's worse, are willing to get into dangerous mining contracts with a majority of hashing power. This is a significant centralization risk as it is not practical or even possible for small miners to enter into these contracts, leading to a situation where moving your hashing power to a larger pool will result in higher profits from hashing power contracts; if these payment providers secure a majority of hashing power with these contracts inevitably there will be a temptation to kick non-compliant miners off the network entirely with a 51% attack.": 2, "Actually we came up with a better way of doing that with SIGHASH_ANYONECANPAY that doesn't need CPFP.": 12, "I don't see why it would be harder to enforce than scorched earth through CFPF.

In either case I think processing power is a negligible cost given how a 90% increase to a very trivial process is still nothing. In terms of having to add inputs to the transaction to fulfill the FSS requirements, there's little loss to the user, even if it's doubling the miner fees, which I think is still a little cost to pay to ensure your transaction confirms quickly; what's 0.0002 from 0.0001 BTC?\n\nIn the second case of only payment processors being able to accept 0-conf transactions, calling what they are doing a sybil attack is a bit of a stretch. I'm pretty sure the big payment processors are running compliant nodes, which is no way harmful to the network at all. It's a bit of a slippery slope you're going onto here, and there's no proof or reason that payment processors have contracts with big miners since there's nearly zero chance of a well propagated transaction to not be mined and be replaced by a double spend.\n\nPersonally, I enjoy having my payments be accepted instantly and I'd definitely be pissed off if I have to wait sometimes up to 40 minutes to wait and use the funds especially if I'm in a hurry. Going full-RBF you will be excluding quite a large amount of already existing use-cases, and I don't think this is something Satoshi himself would have supported. Bitcoin should be evolving as a technology, not the other way around.\n\nUnless you prove that accepting 0-conf transactions is a threat to Bitcoin, neither I nor anyone will support full-RBF.": 1, "There is no doublespend effective detection technology other than through a block(chain).
