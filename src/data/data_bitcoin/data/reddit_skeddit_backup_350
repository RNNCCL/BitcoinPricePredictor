The more people use it, the more utility it will have for each individual.\n\nRight now, Bitcoin is in its infancy. The utility of Bitcoin is as a hedge against rising risks in the banking system as seen in Cyprus in 2013 and Greece some weeks ago. Also, Bitcoin is used to speculate and by companies for enabling cheaper remittances.\n\nThe network effect present here is that the more utility Bitcoin gains, the more people will find it useful and start using it. That in turn will persuade more businesses to offer Bitcoin related services, which in turn will cause more people to adopt Bitcoin.\n\nAt some point, the number of people using Bitcoin may grow so large that mainstream businesses appear that can exclusively be used with Bitcoin. At that point, the utility of Bitcoin skyrockets. Using Bitcoin no longer is a gimmick, it has become a necessity for a large group of people that want to be able to buy the services or goods of a Bitcoin-only business. No longer are people getting into Bitcoin just for thrills, speculation or macro-hedging, but need to get into Bitcoin to be able to buy that Bitcoin-only offering.\n\nAdd to this the following factors:\n\n* Advances are continuously making Bitcoin easier and safer to use. We now have relatively secure smartphone wallets and super secure hardware wallets, as well as Bitcoin ATMs. There are FDIC insured exchanges now.\n\n* Advances in the Bitcoin protocol will increase the potential utility of Bitcoin. For instance, a seemingly small enhancement that enables locking up Bitcoin for a set period of time might enable techniques that allows instant transactions and orders of magnitude more transactions (more technically: CLTV enabling the Lightning network).\n\n* Increased utility combined with more ease of use leads to increased adoption. This cannot other than cause a run-up in the price, which will attract a lot of attention and will very likely create another speculative bubble.\n\n* Hedge funds and investment banks may at some point add Bitcoin to their investment portfolios. There are now ETNs and sooner or later an ETF will see the light. I will leave it to your imagination how adoption by the finance industry is going to affect the price.\n\nTL;DR: There is undeniably a network effect. Bitcoin is demonstrably growing in utility and becoming safer and more user friendly which is fanning adoption. This may increase the price, lead to another bubble, more attention, and more adoption. It is just a matter of time before the finance industry comes on board, which will do a little something to the price as well.': 1, "All currencies work on network effect.

The particular curve used (secp256k1) is not in such wide use, but it's one of a NIST family of curves that is.\n\nBitcoin mining doesn't use elliptic curve cryptography at all; it uses the sha256 cryptographic hashing algorithm, which is in similarly wide use (wider perhaps).": 7}, ('Just paid for my TEDxAruba ticket using bitcoin!', 53): {'I am not sure.

Held at the city\xe2\x80\x99s sleek Passenger Terminal venue, it was far from the typical gathering of oil traders he was used to attending.\n>\nThe chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation, an advocacy group for the controversial virtual currency, wore a shirt emblazoned with the word \xe2\x80\x9cgeek\xe2\x80\x9d. Patrick Byrne, chief executive of Overstock, a retailer, who had spent years railing against Wall Street and short-sellers, gave the keynote speech dressed in a Chinese suit from Shanghai Tang and quoted Marx, Hegel and Kant.\n>\nThe informality did not tip over into triviality, though. \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t know what I was going to find. But the minute I walked in, I realised it was a very serious proposition,\xe2\x80\x9d says 51-year-old Mr Masters, who started trading oil in the 1980s at Shell, decades before bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s creation in 2009 and its subsequent adoption by the libertarian tech community.\n>\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou got a sense of the body corpus of the bitcoin industry, and it\xe2\x80\x99s solid.

A few months later, in July, authorities in Jersey approved the Global Advisors bitcoin fund he runs with his business partner.\n>\nThe fund buys and sells bitcoin in a bid to take advantage of its price movements. Other funds set up in the US are yet to receive approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n>\nHaving suffered bouts of hair-raising volatility, frauds, and the high-profile collapse of an online marketplace that sold illegal drugs for bitcoin, the sector is now attracting a more mainstream crowd.\n>\nWhile early enthusiasts saw the virtual currency as enabling anonymity, the collapse of borders and freedom from traditional banks and middlemen, many of the new entrants have worked for the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest financial institutions. Larry Summers, former treasury secretary, and John Reed, former Citibank chief executive, have joined the advisory board of Silicon Valley bitcoin start-up Xapo, it announced in May.\n>\nStill, in the investment business, Mr Masters is somewhat of an outlier, betting on the future value appreciation for bitcoin. For regulators, there are still concerns. The SEC issued a warning last May to investors about the risks of fraudulent bitcoin and virtual currencies products.\n>\nLast year, HSBC cut its ties with Mr Masters\xe2\x80\x99 companies after 15 years, when he approached them about acting as banker for the bitcoin fund, because of fears about the risk of money laundering, he says. Mr Masters says the fund went through a stringent approval process with the Jersey Financial Services Commission.\n>\nBacklash\n>\nWhy buy a bitcoin fund\n>\nBitcoin attracts its fair share of supporters and detractors, who argue over fees paid to exchanges, the interest by banks in its technology, and the utility of using it for purchases. Jeffrey Robinson, an expert on organised crime, is the author of the book BitCon: the Naked Truth About Bitcoin. He says investors should be aware that the market is very shallow and controlled by a few players.\n>\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhy would you buy into a bitcoin investment fund when, if you want to \xe2\x80\x98invest\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x94 make that, gamble \xe2\x80\x94 on bitcoins, just buy them . . . My advice to anyone thinking about \xe2\x80\x98investing\xe2\x80\x99 in this kind of nonsense is, what you\xe2\x80\x99re really doing is playing roulette. So take your money instead to Las Vegas where you know for sure the wheel isn\xe2\x80\x99t loaded.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\nThose pursuing similar projects to Mr Masters\xe2\x80\x99 are few. In 2013, Barry Silbert launched the Bitcoin Investment Trust, which this year allowed investors to trade its shares on an over-the-counter marketplace. The fund is not registered with the SEC. And a bitcoin exchange-traded fund set up by the twin brothers Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who achieved fame through their involvement with Facebook, is still waiting to be approved.\n>\nBut interest in the sector is growing. Mr Master\xe2\x80\x99s ex-wife Blythe Masters, a JPMorgan veteran who played a key role behind the development of credit- default swaps, this year became chief executive of Digital Asset Holdings, a virtual currency start-up that aims to settle digital and financial assets using the blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin that records its digital transactions.\n>\nThat technology is expanding bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s reach into the boardrooms on Wall Street as banks and exchanges assess how they might make use of it. But as a means of payment, it is still nowhere near to being widely used. The market capitalisation of all bitcoins hovers at about $4.16bn, a fraction of the global currency market. Consumers are more likely to use a Starbucks app on their phone to buy coffee and PayPal to send money to a friend than bitcoin.\n>\nFor Mr Masters, it is an investment opportunity. It has all the characteristics of the oil market when he first started at Shell in London in 1985, he says, being volatile, periodically illiquid and sparsely regulated.\n>\nIt was at Shell in 1986 where he first met Russell Newton, his business partner. In 1999, after Mr Masters had gone on to hone his skills as a trader at Phibro Energy, one of the biggest oil traders of the time, and run the energy business at JPMorgan in New York, the pair set up a commodities fund, Global Advisors.\n>\nHis fund started buying oil at $15 and $16 a barrel for delivery years later, probably buying more than $1bn, he says. His best year was 2000, when the fund returned 40 per cent and had average assets of $180m.\n>\nThe commodity fund was closed in 2013, as investors withdrew their money and commodity prices peaked due to China\xe2\x80\x99s slowing growth. A year later, Mr Masters dived into bitcoin, where he advocates a similar buy and hold strategy overall.\n>\nDemand for bitcoins is likely to increase as it is used for small quick payments through social media such as Facebook for reading news or renting out your WiFi, he believes. It will coexist with digital platforms such as Apple Pay and PayPal, which transfer conventional currency, but it will be used more in cross-border exchange.\n>\nBitcoin and its technology can better integrate with our digital lives than current payment settlement systems, which are already decades old, he says.\n>\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not about \xe2\x80\x98we\xe2\x80\x99re trying to screw the banks\xe2\x80\x99, or hackers taking over finance \xe2\x80\x94 it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to do with that. This is a technology which offers opportunity and utility that simply doesn\xe2\x80\x99t exist in the current system.\xe2\x80\x9d\n>\nBut riding the volatility of bitcoin through Mr Masters\xe2\x80\x99 fund will require investors to place a large amount of trust in him, rather than buying bitcoin directly. Trust is a problem that has bedevilled the digital currency\xe2\x80\x99s development, especially since an ever- expanding number of companies have sprung up to offer services for buying, holding, and selling bitcoin, at a fee.\n>\nSimilar to oil in the late 1990s, when investing directly was rare, he wants to bring more investors into bitcoin. His fund has attracted 10 investors including wealthy individuals, family offices, and two global money management firms. The invested amount ranges from the $100,000 minimum to $600,000 per investor, he says. It is up more than 20 per cent this month because of the turmoil over Greece.\n>\nUnlike many who attend bitcoin conferences, Mr Masters believes the digital currency can flourish only in partnership with legacy financial institutions, such as the large banks.\n>\nThere has been a clear change since he started the fund among banks and governments, he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe lesson of the last year or two is the more transparent, the more embracing of regulation, and the less libertarian and confrontational you are, the better your bitcoin business does.\xe2\x80\x9d': 10, '>Mr Master\xe2\x80\x99s ex-wife **Blythe Masters**, a JPMorgan veteran who played a key role behind the development of credit- default swaps, this year became chief executive of Digital Asset Holdings, a virtual currency start-up that aims to settle digital and financial assets using the blockchain, the technology behind bitcoin that records its digital transactions.\n\nLOL!': 6, '> Masters: \xe2\x80\x9cThe lesson of the last year or two is the more transparent, the more embracing of regulation, and the less libertarian and confrontational you are, the better your bitcoin business does.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nLOL.

A copy pasta summary from a reddit thread a while back that summarizes it better than I ever could:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3aicvf/what_villain_lived_long_enough_to_see_themselves/csd2rrl?context=3\n\n>Bill Gates was a ruthless, cutthroat businessman who made his vast wealth by using every dirty trick in the book (and inventing a few new dirty tricks along the way) and then using Microsoft\'s success to effectively hold the computer industry hostage for 20 years.\n\n>He viewed any successful non-Microsoft software as a threat, even if that software was for Windows. And if that software was cross-platform he viewed it as an existential threat, since it lessened people\'s dependence on Microsoft.\n\n>Internet Explorer? Microsoft didn\'t make it. They completely missed the boat on the World Wide Web, and with the popularity of the Netscape Navigator web browser (which was available on almost every computer, from $20k SGI workstations to Macs to Windows PCs), Bill Gates & co saw a threat to Microsoft\'s dominance, so they rushed to get their own web browser by buying one from a company called Spyglass Software. Now, since Netscape Navigator cost money, everyone assumed Microsoft would charge for Internet Explorer, and Microsoft\'s contract with Spyglass Software promised to give Spyglass a cut of whatever money they made from Internet Explorer sales. So what did Microsoft do? They released Internet Explorer for free, which was something none of their competitors could do since Microsoft had such deep pockets. Spyglass Software was ruined, and so was Netscape eventually. Once Internet Explorer was available, Microsoft threatened not to sell Windows to any PC manufacturer that bundled Netscape Navigator, which would later get them in trouble with the Department of Justice and the EU.\n\n>DirectX? Began life as an OpenGL knock-off that would (Microsoft hoped) lock-in developers to Windows. Hell, Microsoft was so afraid of OpenGL (since it was cross platform and the industry standard at the time) that they offered to partner with SGI (creator of OpenGL) on a new, cross platform graphics library called FireGL. Except that Microsoft had no intention of actually releasing FireGL. They hoped working on FireGL would distract SGI from advancing OpenGL long enough to let DirectX (then called Direct3D) catch up to it, and when their plan worked Microsoft just up and abandoned FireGL.\n\n>When 3D accelerators were new (which are now called GPUs), there was a much larger number of companies developing desktop GPUs than the nVidia/AMD/Intel tri-opoly we have today, and many of them were too small to afford to create their own full OpenGL implementations. Since most PC GPUs at the time only implemented a small subset of OpenGL in hardware, Microsoft wrote a full software OpenGL implementation and then offered it to GPU companies, so those companies could just replace the parts that their GPU implemented in hardware and still have a full OpenGL driver. Once they had all spent a good deal of time doing this, Microsoft actually refused to license any of their OpenGL code for release, effectively guaranteeing that smaller GPU companies would only have support for DirectX.\n\n>Video For Windows? VFW (now called Windows Media or whatever) only came into being because Microsoft literally stole the source code to QuickTime For Windows. Both Microsoft and Intel were having a hard time getting video to play smoothly on PCs, when Apple surprised them both by releasing QuickTime For Windows, a port of their QuickTime video framework for Macintosh. QuickTime For Windows could to smooth video playback on ordinary PCs with no special hardware, and Microsoft and Intel were caught completely off guard by it. Apple had contracted out to a 3rd party company to do the Windows port of QuickTime, so what did MS do? They went to the same company and gave them a ton of money to develop Video For Windows, but an insanely short schedule, knowing full well that the company would essentially have to re-use a lot of the QuickTime For Windows source code to get the project done on time.\n\n>When Apple found out (their contract with the other company stated that Apple owned all the QuickTime For Windows source code), they went ballistic and sued Microsoft. Microsoft had been caught red-handed and knew that Apple had them by the balls. So MS settled. Remember when Microsoft "bailed out" Apple in the 90s by buying $150 million in Apple stock? Despite what the tech press reported, that\'s not what actually happened. The $150 million in non-voting Apple stock that Microsoft bought was part of their settlement (Apple was no longer on the verge of bankruptcy by that point, and didn\'t need to be bailed out).

One entity could be quite wrong but all of them is unlikely. This is good enough for my purposes.\n\nSecondly, most OSs use NTP these days. You would almost have to go out of your way to make the timestamps inaccurate.\n\nThirdly, while times may drift a bit, that rule you quoted above means that if you get too far out, all that time your pool spent mining a block could be wasted.

I have no access to historical data but I could check new blocks. It would be subject to network latency of course and probably the time it takes bitcoin-qt to verify a block.

There are some who believe this will already be priced in and others who have other reasons to be skeptical.

You can construct your bitcoin address using the public key, but you cannot construct your public key using your bitcoin address. When you send bitcoin to a specific bitcoin address, you don't need the public key, so when you first send money to a new address, the public key is not published anywhere. It's a secret that only you know as the owner of an address. When you go to spend bitcoin from this address you publish a spend transaction into the blockchain. In order for anyone to verify you are the rightful owner of this address they need to verify the signature you generate against the public key. For this reason the public key is provided as part of the transaction. In other words, in order to spend bitcoins you have to publish your public key. Here's where the danger comes in: If your public key was constructed using poor RNG someone with sufficient skills can reconstruct your private key from your public key. This is what happened in the android wallet attack:\nhttp://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/9694/technical-details-of-attack-on-android-bitcoin-usage-of-securerandom\n\nA yet hypothetical and secondary issue is what Vitalik Buterin reported on in this article: \nhttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/6021/bitcoin-is-not-quantum-safe-and-how-we-can-fix/\nQuantum computers in the future may be able to find the private key given knowledge of the public key.\n\nSo in conclusion, in most cases, assuming strong RNG, reusing an address is not dangerous, but given that new addresses are free, why would you put yourself at risk if you don't need to?": 9, '/u/Changetip $1': 1, 'The Bitcoin tip for 1 upvote (331 bits/$0.10) has been collected by *whitslack*.\n\n\n--\n\n[^^what ^^is ^^ChangeTip?](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/wiki/tipping-on-reddit)': 3, 'What?

And now I have to read up on what a stealth key is :)": 1, '* It destroys your privacy and seriously hurts the privacy of *everyone you transact with*, so it\'s considered courteous to not reuse addresses if at all possible.\n* If ECDSA is broken, Bitcoin can remain reasonably secure if you don\'t reuse addresses. ECDSA and most other public-key crypto is *known* to be completely broken against sufficiently large quantum computers, which are generally believed to be possible and not too far away, so it\'s prudent to not stake everything on ECDSA. (In the absence of address reuse, Bitcoin can claim to be QC-resistant.)\n* ECDSA is more "fragile". Frequently, particular (bad) implementations of ECDSA turn out to be completely broken, allowing anyone to steal your bitcoins if they\'re stored in an address that has ever before "sent" bitcoins.\n* Address reuse is considered to be an accidental "feature" that isn\'t *really* supported by the developers.\n* There are several proposals for different address types that offer additional features or security but are incompatible with address reuse. So it\'s best to get used to not reusing addresses now.\n\nHowever, there are some rare cases where it\'s currently *far* more convenient to use a few unchanging addresses. The biggest example is when you want to do transparent accounting. Despite the misleading info given by most block explorers, it\'s generally not the case that an address is equal to an account. (That is, an address\'s sent transactions might not actually be meaningful, related to its receipts, or even made by the person who receives money at that address.) But it\'s easy enough to arrange things so that one or more your addresses *do* behave like accounts, and then you can use those addresses plus block explorer sites as an easy way of providing convincing (though not conclusive) public transaction records. You *could* use a hierarchical deterministic wallet and publish the master public key, but this has the same privacy problems as address reuse, and the technology for HD wallets isn\'t that well-developed yet, so I don\'t think that it\'s worthwhile. Ideally there should be some way of proving certain facts about your BTC holdings/transactions without giving away everything about the actual transactions, but this technology doesn\'t exist yet AFAIK.\n\nAnother case where it\'s especially convenient to reuse addresses is when you want to receive regular payments from the same source or you want to accept anonymous donations. These cases should ideally be handled by giving a master public key to the sender, but again, HD wallets aren\'t sufficiently well-developed or standardized to make this comfortable in many cases.\n\nIn these few cases, I think it\'s acceptable to reuse addresses for the time being. But when someone is just asking you for a one-time payment address, you really should generate a new one each time. You should also generate new addresses on EWallets like Coinbase whenever depositing. (I\'ve noticed that many of them only give you new addresses if you explicitly request it, which is stupid.)': 87, 'Ideally you would use stealth addresses or upload a HD seed key instead of a simple address.': 2, "My understanding was that Mycelium handles this automatically by sending the change back to a new address every time you send a transaction. Since it's an HD wallet there is one master key, but virtually unlimited addresses under that.": 1, 'Right. It\'s very unlikely that any 0-day vulnerability in ECDSA itself will allow an attacker to break keys in less than a few hours. The quantum algorithm for breaking EC keys does still require a non-trivial amount of computation, and the first quantum computers will be super slow, so it\'ll probably take at least some weeks for the first sufficiently large quantum computer to break a key.\n\nIf QC ever becomes a real threat, the current plan is to switch to a Lamport signature scheme. Lamport signatures are QC-proof, considered extremely strong in general, and are very fast, though even gmaxwell\'s especially size-efficient Lamport scheme has signatures that are a bit uncomfortably large. Address reuse will be incompatible with Lamport signatures because each time you sign something it becomes much easier for someone to brute-force your private key.
