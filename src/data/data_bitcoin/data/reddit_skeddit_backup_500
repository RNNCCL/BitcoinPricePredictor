The blockchain also enables the development of new governance systems with more democratic or participatory decision-making, and decentralized (autonomous) organizations that can operate over a network of computers without any human intervention. These applications have lead many to compare the blockchain to the Internet, with accompanying predictions that this technology will shift the balance of power away from centralized authorities in the field of communications, business, and even politics or law.\n\nIn this Article, we explore the benefits and drawbacks of this emerging decentralized technology and argue that its widespread deployment will lead to expansion of a new subset of law, which we term Lex Cryptographia: rules administered through self-executing smart contracts and decentralized (autonomous) organizations. As blockchain technology becomes widely adopted, centralized authorities, such as governmental agencies and large multinational corporations, could lose the ability to control and shape the activities of disparate people through existing means.

The demand seems to have come mostly from a large contingent of amateur commodity day-traders, who found bitcoin much more fun to trade than tea or garlic, because of its fungibility and its wild unpredictable price swings.  Their buying pushed the price from ~13 to ~1200 (although there was much reaction buiyn by investors outside China who saw the price rise and jumped in).\n\nThe drop during the last 15 months can only have been due to those same investors selling out and dropping out of the game.

So we add computers & crypto.\nThe document in question is condensed down to a single cryptographic hash, which (should[2]) to all intents and purposes be unique for a given document, despite being only a few tens of characters long, regardless of the size of the original input.\n\nThis hash then serves as proof[3] that you have the source document, without anyone being able to turn it back into the original document. This is a very one-way process.\n\nThen, you need to find someone to vouch for your hash and indicate when they first saw it. You can do this with lawyers/notaries again as before[4], which partly solves the forgery problem, but not the trust one.\n\nThe solution proposed here is to store that hash in the bitcoin block-chain, which is a distributed log of all transactions on the bitcoin network, which has 3 nice properties:\n\n1. It\'s append-only. Once your hash is encoded in there, it\'s staying there as long as bitcoin exists[5].\n\n2. It\'s peer-to-peer/distributed. There\'s no single controlling organisation you need to trust for answers.\n\n3. It\'s updated regularly enough that timestamps can be relatively fine-grained.\n\nSo you stuff it in there using this tool or whatever, and then X years hence when you need to prove you\'d actually created that file in 2013, you should be able to prove that to most people\'s satisfaction.\n\nThis is a loose take on the matter and glosses over whole swathes of other complexities involved, but is probably close enough for [non]government work :)\n\n[1] That is, who discovered/did something first. You may want to be able to claim you did in future, but without making it public at the time, because you might tip your rivals off to the idea before you\'ve fully developed it. See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_priority\n\n[2] Breaking (or "colliding") hashes is a whole subfield of cryptography research, and some pretty impressive things have been done there. It\'s why you probably shouldn\'t use MD5 for anything nowadays, for example. But again, we\'ll handwave "Done Properly = unique identifier".\n\n[3] Well, in the same way that a password proves that you\'re the/a person who knows that password - if you did it right and never told anyone, it should be exclusively you. But if it leaks somehow, others could represent the hash as belonging to something they own. But if they only have the hash and not the original source document, there are relatively easy tests that could distinguish them. That\'s not very important here though.\n\n[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_timestamping\n\n[5] well, mostly. But it\'s really hard, and the same capabilities let you defraud the rest of the bitcoin network with double-spending and whatnot, so unless your timestamp priority is super-important, you\'re probably ok.': 2, '/u/redfacedquark, redpistachios wants to send you a Bitcoin tip for 1000 bits ($0.25).

In addition I was asked to present to the Board a sustainable path forward for the organization. The following Strategic Proposal was sent to Board ahead of our meeting on the 17th: https://www.scribd.c...ategic-Proposal\n\nMy understanding was that the Board would come to consensus and work with the staff to create a communications plan for the membership to bring them into the discussion. Over the weeks that didn\'t happen. Many alternative proposals were also considered in the interim by multiple Board members, mostly based on this initial proposal.\n\nWhich direction the Foundation takes is ultimately a decision the Board should reach, hopefully with consensus.\n\n******\n\nThis reply is of interest.\nhttps://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1286-strategic-proposal/page__st__20#entry13865\n\nSeveral times, in the past, the matter of "what the Foundation should do and how" has been discussed on the forums.  I thought it was quite obvious that the core development needed to be split off. It was also blatantly obvious and ignored that the goals and interests of consumers and "industry" were at times diametrically opposed.\n\nI am going to focus on strategic intent of the Strategic Proposal - strategic for whom?  Strategic for what?\n\nThe intent is to split off control of the Bitcoin Core and have it controlled by big money interests - those who would pay for the ability to influence the direction of development.  You explicitly state they would not want their interests compromised by a bunch of little people paying $25 fees.\n\n**italics**\n"People willing to invest the large amounts needed to fund engineering want the ability to direct funding without the reputational or management risk of an elected board."\n\n\n**italics**\n"Large donors don\xe2\x80\x99t want to commit significant capital to an org where they must share 50% control of their funds with members who pay as little as $25."\n\n**italics**\n"NewCo will be structured to specifically meet the needs of highest value contributors in terms of oversight of their funds, must likely through direct board representation"\n\nThese are your words.  This is the main thrust of your Strategic Proposal.  Bitcoin development would be controlled by a small secret cabal, without any user input.  \n\nIn terms of timelines the BF Board would have to create NewCo before the voting in of two new members which should be happening at this moment but is not ("Spring 2015 elections").
