Managed by a network of thousands of independent computers that collectively verify and maintain a public ledger of transactions, these systems allow users to exchange digital currency and other tokens of value without using fee-charging intermediaries such as banks.\n\n> In its early years, enthusiastic individual investors, who saw bitcoin as a potential challenger to traditional currencies, flocked to largely unregulated, online exchanges and bid its price up to a peak above $1,100 in late November 2013. But in 2014, as regulators started drafting rules covering bitcoin and negative headlines linked it to illicit drug sales, security breaches and the collapse of Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox, the price fell dramatically. It now trades at around $265.\n\n> Mr. Betts\xe2\x80\x99s firm and others responded to those events by building more sophisticated trading infrastructure that could help instill more confidence in bitcoin and meet the stringent compliance demands of large, regulated financial institutions. Despite the negative headlines surrounding bitcoin, these new entrepreneurs maintain there is considerable interest in it among hedge funds and other institutional investors, participants whose deep pockets could help bring some stability to bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s volatile price. Wall Street, they say, is warming to the idea that the technology behind bitcoin, if not the currency itself, could slash costs from the global financial system.\n\n> Unlike pioneering offshore websites such as Mt. Gox, which pooled funds from retail investors into common accounts with minimal disclosure, Noble\xe2\x80\x99s system will be limited to corporate and institutional investors whose funds will be placed in transparent, segregated accounts safeguarded by third-party institutions, Mr. Betts said. Settlement and clearing will occur through a sophisticated, proprietary model that includes real-time reconciliation of account balances, he added.\n\n> \xe2\x80\x9cThere is a lot of demand\xe2\x80\x9d for digital currency trading from institutions, he said, noting that his early conversations with investors involved a lot of \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is bitcoin?\xe2\x80\x9d questions, whereas now he hears, \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin is interesting, but where can we trade?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d He added, \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of them just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do business with the existing exchanges.

However, there is no hidden code snippet, it is in the specs of the order type, granted not abundantly clear. What\'s even more important, is that as an investor, these particular orders have no bearing on your experience in managing your investments. You have no use for these order types which are designed to allow electronic market makers to manage specific SEC rules.

The spending transaction contains your Public Key but the destination is a Bitcoin Address where some or all of the bitcoins are to be sent.  The Bitcoin Address is a hash of a Public Key.  Being a hash, it can't be used to determine the Public Key.  The person sending you Bitcoin won't know your Public Address until you spend those coins. That is one of the reasons some people recommend never using a Bitcoin Address more than once.\n\n> But the Private Key is needed to create a digital signature in order for the blockchain to be able to trace back and verify that you do own whatever amount of bitcoin you are trying to send.\n\nThe blockchain doesn't need your Private Key.  It just needs proof that you know the Private Key.  The Public Key you provide when you want to spend Bitcoins has to A) hash to the Bitcoin Address the coins were sent to and B) decrypt the signature which can only have been created with the matching Private Key. By being able to encrypt a signature that the Public Key can decrypt you have proven you know the Private Key.  By verifying that same Public Key hashes to the Bitcoin Address you have proven you own the address by proving you know the Private Key which matches the  Public Key which matches the Bitcoin Address.\n\n> The confusing part is how do they know that the private key is correct?\n\nOnly the one true Private Key can encrypt a signature that can be decrypted by the Public Key.\n\n> What if someone took your public key and used their own fake private key?\n\nAny other Public Key would not hash to the same Bitcoin Address and any other Private Key would not be able to encrypt a signature you can be decrypted with the Public Key that hashes to the right Bitcoin Address.\n\n> I'm aware it would be refused by the blockchain but how does it know that it isn't legit without actually knowing what the private key is?\n\nThe blockchain never sees the Private Key.

She can verify that it came from Bob because she is able to decrypt it using his public key, and also verify the hash.\n\nFor privacy, Bob can first encrypt with his private key, then with Alice's public key. This ensures that only Alice can read the message.\n\nEdit: note that bitcoin is pseudonymous, so there is no need to associate a sender's identity with their public key.

In other words, the private key can encrypt the transaction to generate cyphertext, which ONLY the public key can decrypt.\n\nWhen you generate a transaction, the wallet software generates a "script" which specifies the destination addresses to which the unspent balances on your address will be sent.

Offline, the Visa and INTERAC networks compete healthily, but online, Visa is potentially forming a monopoly.\n\nUnfortunately, INTERAC Online purchases are much more secure, meaning we can only accept them as payment. Visa purchases can be easily reversed, and even if we could mitigate the issue, Visa will not allow us to accept their cards.\n\nFew options here. The first is to tell your branch you're not comfortable with your chequing account being Visa enabled. Should a fraudulent charge go through on the Visa part (anywhere in the world), scheduled payments like car/mortgage/rent could bounce before you notice. You are covered for the money, but not for the inconvenience. Personally, this is why I don't have a Visa Debit. I use a Visa Credit, and only risk my available credit. The branch may issue you standard card for this reason.\n\nSecond, RBC has a much better solution and many of our customers have opened up RBC accounts not just to use QuickBT but also to avoid any risks of Visa Debit. With RBC, you are always issued a standard client card. You have the option to receive a second, Visa Debit card, which is linked to your chequing account.

": 3, ">Unemployed people don't buy gold.\n\nThis is an interesting point. The unemployed don't buy gold because gold is primarily a store of value and they have minimal wealth to protect and it reduces the usefulness if that wealth (it's not easily spent).\n\nBitcoin is a bit different because it can be a store of wealth and a unit of exchange. It can be spent easily (although not in as many places as we would like right now) and (at the moment) legally. Bitcoin is a useful gold for the low paid and unemployed.\n\nWith a 2008-or-worse style crash I think we would see an initial decrease in the bitcoin price with people divesting to pay bills (I think what Coin Rookie says about a lot of bitcoiners being young and broke  is true) but after this there could be very rapid growth. Decreasing buying power of the ordinary person's dollar (or more likely euro) could become pronounced. The bitcoin price stabilises or starts to increase a bit with wealthier people moving into it (some from the old gold brigade) and it becomes attractive to ordinary people to shelter their wealth. \n\nBusiness acceptance grows and the poorest can start to pay their bills with bitcoin. In time they are paid in bitcoin, completing the loop.\n\nBut this is the standard narrative for us more or less. There are two main questions for me though: the law and the timing.\n\nIf governments really crack down on bitcoin so that legal bitcoin businesses find it hard to operate, the (potential) loop could be broken and so adoption slows, stops or decreases. Sensible governments could make bitcoin-friendly tax infrastructure and profit from this kind of situation. I think this could happen in the Eurozone where many different governments are bounded by the same fiat currency.\n\nThe timing of the next crisis is important too. At the moment the bitcoin supply is growing relatively quickly every day. If the price shot up today to near $1000 it would probably be unsustainable in terms of the quantity of fiat coming in. The real game begins after a couple of block halvings.\n\nIf the crisis is too soon then bitcoin bubbles, antibitcoin laws are made and it gets tough. These two things could cancel out though: bubble comes, bitcoin looks good, bubble pops, bitcoin looks bad, no laws are passed as it's not seen as a real threat and bitcoin waits on the sidelines for the next crisis.\n\nI do worry about Satoshi's coins though.
