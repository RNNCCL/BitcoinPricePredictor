It\'s pretty simple. Blockchains are useful primarily where you have a shared value(s), among non-trusting or disintermediated entities, and you need to bootstrap a network effect.  Network effects are extremely difficult and time-consuming things to catalyze.  There are good reasons (for the market, for society) why existing standards are difficult to supplant and tend to ossify.  An ounce of stability/dependibility/predictability is often worth a pound of "new and better".\n\nThat\'s why ipv4 hasnt been replaced by ipv6.  Thats why bitcoin had to be, not just potentially marginally better than gov\'t money, but potentially revolutionary (if it could just be bootstrapped into position as unit of account money, without a central power telling us all to use it and value it to such and such a price).  That\'s why, while the utility of the network as payment rail and the blocksize debate are important, they ultimately distract from the real logical end of the bitcoin experiment (money, not paypal alternative) and they ignore or take for granted the massive first-mover-advantage and hard-won network effect which bitcoin has.\n\nThat\'s why it is silly and short-sighted for people to be so concerned and surprised (let alone driven away from bitcoin in a tantrum) that there\'s this division and in-fighting and difficulty over a fairly trivial hard-fork. The protocol is already largely ossified. Get over it.  Recognize the value in that and the market wisdom emergent in this state of affairs.\n\nThat\'s why very few banks or private institutions will ultimately find much use for blockchains.  Blockchains are ultimately only a better tool by which to express uncoerced market demand for public goods.

More processing time means less number of times miners go to the well for the next block, and that trip to the well is the place where miners are likely to get lucky and pull a block first to start chewing on it.

BitCoin is a great idea, and the world would be better off to rally around one currency. But at the same time the downside of BitCoin was that it chose SHA256 as the proof of work. SHA is easily  parallelizable in hardware. This gave people with custom ASICs and the capital a mining advantage. \n\nI like how LiteCoin did everything exactly the same as BitCoin, but changed it use scrypt as the proof of work. Scrypt was designed to stymie parallelization or custom hardware. It\'s a shame the original BitCoin didn\'t choose an algorithm that\'s hard to implement in hardware, or didn\'t switch to scrypt as soon as possible. Everyone world be on a much more even footing. But BitCoin didn\'t, and now we\'re stuck with it.\n\n I don\'t like the idea of fragmenting the crypto currency ecosystem - everyone printing their own money - we need one to take off.

Nobody got ddosd when it was raised from 256kB, but there wasn\'t 53% with huge hardware interested in it.\n\nIdeally the block chain would fork into using scrypt - rendering my ASICs useless.

I'm not necessarily saying that I endorse his view on whether it's a waste. But his opinion should be taken into consideration because he's smart.\n\nAlso, sidechains *do* actually solve all of these problems, which is why they are such a priority.

Now we have a system where we can handle effective 2MB worth of transactions.  If this is almost no cost, then why don't we just raise the block size to 2MB rather than putting transactions on a sidechain?\n\nFurthermore, namecoin has been merge mined for years.

You *will not* gain any traction from miners, because you cannot have an incentive to mine without creating more than 21 million bitcoins.  Sure, they could collect transaction fees, but they can already do that on bitcoin.  There is no reason to move bitcoin transactions onto sidechains if you want to scale.  Sidechains are not a scalability solution.\n\nAnd the problem with Lightning is similar.  If we move bitcoin transactions onto the Lightning network, then we are essentially stealing those transaction fees from miners.  As bitcoin continues to halve its rewards miners will be left with little to no incentive to mine if 99%+ transactions have moved off-chain, transactions which they otherwise would have taken fees for.  This would have a far greater centralizing effect than simply raising the block size and using bitcoin traditionally.": 0, 'Sidechains are a meta-solution.

Because they are different chains, that's why. Different people will be running nodes on them. Bandwidth for each can be much lower with higher total tx capacity.\n\n> Do you know how much hashpower namecoin has? About 25% of bitcoin's. With an incentive. After many years.\n\nAnd literally nobody uses namecoin. That's not bad at all. Bitcoin was highly secure with 25% its current hashpower.": 2, "> you cannot have an incentive to mine without creating more than 21 million bitcoins\n\nFirst of all, that is always an option. If there is anything the block size debate has shown, it's that the protocol is always up for change if the economic majority wills it. While they idea of removing the 21 million cap may be heresy with today's community, tomorrow's community may not think so, particularly if there are compelling arguments for its necessity and enough FUD. The idea of raising the cap is not popular with today's investors, who represent a very important part of Bitcoin's early success, because a limited cap promises a continued appreciation of the currency's value. But in the future, lower fees for users, higher revenue for miners, and the promise of continued security for society may make raising the cap a very appealing idea to all parties with the power see it implemented. It may be determined by economist that a constant increase of the money supply to match global growth is desired and few may be there to argue with them. People should be under no illusions about the 21 million cap being etched in stone. \n\nSecondly, the block size debate has demonstrated how powerful miners are in determining the future of Bitcoin. This power has economic value in and off itself, and as Bitcoin grows, may eventually outweigh the actual revenue gained by mining Bitcoins itself. Mining, that is, may be done in order to increase ones voting power over the central bank known as Bitcoin, rather than to actually profit directly from the mining revenue. If this is true, then eventually transaction fees could go to zero. \n\nIn my mind, the important consideration of side chains and off-chain solutions is that they promote innovation and competition that could really explode the ecosystem forward in ways people aren't expecting. If everything remains focused on the protocol layer, it is going to be one endless political battle after another. Ideally, the base layer should be run by people who are economically neutral and not trying to benefit one party over another . . . but this can only occur if all interested parties make sure they have sufficient voting power.

Have you abandoned your other arguments?\n\n> Namecoin can be 51% attacked today by a single bitcoin pool.\n\nYes. Bitcoin can be 51% attacked by two pools, last I checked. This is why any sidechain that merge mines (as opposed to proof of stake or some other option) should try to achieve as high and dispersed hashpower as possible.
