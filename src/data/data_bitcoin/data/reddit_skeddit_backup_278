Since the banks most likely trust each other more so than the anonymous peers, **a new, modern clearing system would probably in fact be even cheaper and more efficient than the blockchain**, because the energy-hungry "proof of work" ("mining" at Bitcoin) would be made redundant.\n\n> Moreover, **banks could configure their system in a user-friendlier fashion for less tech-savvy customers** and enhance their offer with **extra personalised financial services, which the blockchain cannot do** as things stand today.\n\n> Currently, **blockchain technology is still in its infancy**. This means that the banks and other **intermediaries still have time** to analyse the new technological challenges.\n\n> **So far there has not been any regulatory restriction of P2P mechanisms in the financial system**.

Yes blockchains may be slightly better than the old system designed for paper, but that is not relevant, because a whole range of modern database solutions are available.  Blockchains are a particularly bad choice for many reasons.  Blockchains are extremely complicated, slow, have scaling issues, difficult to implement, have few experts available for hire, are unproven, expensive and are vulnerable from a security perspective.

Firstly Banks and Blythe are not experts on Blockchains, they probably do not understand it and just thinks it sounds cool or is geeky.  The banks are starting to realize this now anyway and are moving away from Blockchains.  Banks are now focusing on and investigating better databases, more integration between systems and better use of digital signatures.  In around 12 to 18 months banks would have worked this out.

And with the blockchain technology they are assured that the transactions are unique ans thus can act on it faster. For example if I send you money via online bank transfer. They won\'t show in your account until 2-3 days. This is because both my bank has to make sure they log and remove appropriate amount of cash to you bank and your bank has them to validate it them self as well and then allocate these money (well the ledger) from their general deposit to reflect the amount you own.

You propose flying to school everyday. Despite my shared excitment, I am trying to explain to you that it is actually more effective to use a car. An airplane is only effective over longer distances or to pass obsticals.\n\nIn the same way blockchains are only effective when the system is permissionless, which is not what banks want.

The epistemological corollary is the axiom that consciousness is the faculty of perceiving that which exists\xe2\x80\x94and that man gains knowledge of reality by looking outward. The rejection of these axioms represents a reversal: the primacy of consciousness\xe2\x80\x94the notion that the universe has no independent existence, that it is the product of a consciousness (either human or divine or both). The epistemological corollary is the notion that man gains knowledge of reality by looking inward (either at his own consciousness or at the revelations it receives from another, superior consciousness).\n\nThe source of this reversal is the inability or unwillingness fully to grasp the difference between one\xe2\x80\x99s inner state and the outer world, i.e., between the perceiver and the perceived (thus blending consciousness and existence into one indeterminate package-deal).

There is no user interface and only rudimentary developer tools. \n\n3) You can sign up for Tierion in 30 seconds. We have an easy to use API and developer documentation. With Factom, you have to install three command line interface programs, exchange Bitcoin for Factoids, convert Factoids to Entry Credits, and then you can use the command line interface to write data to Factom. It's a very complicated experience. They are working on a docker image to make things simpler.\n\nFactom has chosen to create a blockchain that is anchored to the bitcoin blockchain.  If you choose to use Factom, your application will have a dependency on the Factom blockchain. If it fails, your application probably fails. They have also chosen to create an altcoin. If you choose to use Factom, you will always need to acquire Factoids to write additional data to a Factom chain.\n\nWith Tierion, we've created a [scalable protocol](http://github.com/chainpoint) for recording data in the bitcoin blockchain and generating blockchain receipts. These receipts are portable. You can store them wherever you like. You can also share them with other applications that can independently verify the receipt.\n\nFactom is still in the very early stages of development.  They just reached their first milestone required to receive their [first payment from the Factoid crowdsale](https://koinify.com/blog/introducing-the-factom-software-sale/).  The second milestone requires Factom to build a storefront and a consensus mechanism for eight federated servers.  This will likely take several months.  The third milestone requires moving away from the current centralized model to a decentralized model.  This will likely take several additional months.\n\nI hope anyone who has been looking at Factom gives [Tierion](http://Tierion.com) a try. I think you'll prefer our developer experience and you won't miss the reliance on an altcoin.": 3, "I submit to you that after nearly 6 years of solid up time we are sufficiently decentralized in relation to our current user base and credible threats.  Please refute me with actual data otherwise we're just swinging our dicks around. \n\nObviously, a superpower stands a good chance of knocking over our little beehive.   But bitcoin is tiny, it doesn't currently have anywhere close to the resources to defend against that threat right now. Agreed? Its only hope is to grow so fucking big and pervasive that governments will be afraid to piss off their citizen base in that manner.\n\nTake a gander at Litecoin.  It shares the same goal as Bitcoin (an uncorrupted blockchain) and is using the same strategies.  It is also successfully realizing that goal but with far fewer consumed resources.  Those resources (electricity) are either held in reserve or the free market is directing them to activities that are useful.\n\n": 1, "Just to be clear, with Tierion we're talking about the Bitcoin blockchain.": 8, 'Got it.

I hope we see some graduate thesis on this stuff.': 11, "Feedback for the author: your description of the relay network is incorrect. The relay network isn't like a CDN at all. Rather it has very much the same functionality as IBLT: nodes know what transactions their connections have, and don't bother transmitting those. It also has a backbone of optimally connected nodes in order to minimize latency. Here's a good description of it:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QpK6k0yRDWI": 6, 'Did either of you read the article?  Did you understand it?  There was no slam dunk in there, though there were some interesting ideas to consider.\n\n"allows two peers to efficiently reach the same state while transferring the minimal amount of data by sending only the differences."  This still implies a node would need to send the diffs.  Most people advocating larger blocks don\'t even consider overhead and assume the data being sent is just 2 x the block size (one in and one out) meaning the minimum possible size.  This idea would help limit the data sent to just that but there is no magic that for example could get us to half of that (1 x block size).\n\nThe node boostrapping idea using a CDN is good, and it seems it will help in terms of allowing new nodes to startup faster and more efficiently, perhaps helpful during an attack, but the focus of the concern of the conservative perspective has been the cost to run a node, and hasn\'t been too concerned about the cost to launch a node.  The net, great idea, but it doesn\'t solve the main bottleneck of limited bandwidth.\n\n"However, an individual node can be replaced with a cluster of machines running the distributed, sharded node. This would increase the resilience of an individual node without sacrificing any of the network\xe2\x80\x99s decentralized properties."  Great goal for data-center based nodes but I think it will be a while before that helps nodes running on private servers, in homes etc.  The concern with data center hosted nodes is one of state control.  Data centers are easy points of attack.  Ask TPB about that.\n\n"However, one should allow a significant margin-of-error when making projections 20 years in future. Even if 8 gigabyte blocks in 2036 sound feasible, one should account for larger network and, thus, more than 8 connections per peer to maintain low latency. Further dampening factors include those not related to network, e.g., room for cryptographic agility."

So they can include transactions that are rejected under the new rules.\n\nWhat happens then? Well, upgraded nodes ignore the block and eventually the miner majority will build a replacement block at the same height. The old invalid block will become invalidated and the miner loses the income.\n\nThe problem is that users will have seen in their wallets that a possibly invalid transaction got one confirm. If unlucky and if a lot of hashpower hasn't upgraded, you might even see an invalid transaction get two or three confirms before eventually the network fixes itself.\n\nObviously, SPV users have learned to consider confirmed transactions as pretty safe, because they normally are. Soft forks invalidate this hard won experience and thus open users up to the risk of payment fraud. \n\nIn a hard fork, there's a single, clean split point. All the blocks made by old miners accumulate on the minority hashpower chain and SPV wallets know how to ignore it, because the SPV algorithm involves finding the highest work chain and following it. So miners won't accidentally make blocks that look to SPV wallets like they should be valid but actually aren't.\n\nNB: after all miners have upgraded the difference between soft and hard fork stops mattering, except that soft forks often result in weirder scripts being used due to the desire to trick old nodes into accepting transactions regardless of validity.": 3, 'So if I have 1BTC on my most "current" address and 0.5BTC sent to an "older" address (all from the same HD seed), my wallet client would function as if I had 1.5BTC total in one address?\n\nIf so, doesn\'t that defeat the purpose of an HD wallet by linking an old address with a new one?': 3, "Could you not just operate a float by buying btc from others to sell later?

For security in being unable to rewrite history you generally want the most energy, strongest chain approach, anything else is a sticky plaster security approach.  The strongest chain is clearly bitcoin's blockchain  (we're talking thousands of times more powerful than even a very large private company could offer (nearly $1million per day running costs) ) and personally I wouldn't trust anything else right now as it's bigger than anything by vast orders of magnitude.\n\n\nThe anonymously appending transactions is also a specific usecase that most companies don't need.  It typically is only helpful if you want your database to be public, not private otherwise you can use cheaper, faster, more scalable databases that are already widely used.\n\n\nBitcoin's blockchain essentially is the only one I'd trust for transferring real value or anything where an immutable history is required.  If you do find the niche where a private blockchain is somehow appropriate I'd still tie it to bitcoin anyhow since you have so much security with it than anything that can be made in house.\n\n\nI.e. the whole 'blockchain not bitcoin' is merely a PR line due to bitcoin's brand issue and most people are actually talking about bitcoin when they say blockchain.

Attempting to read UTF-8 text as ASCII will result in data corruption unless the UTF-8 string happens to not use any of the new features. I wouldn't describe that as graceful degradation, given the mess that results on people's screens.\n\nHowever UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII. An old ASCII string can be fed into a UTF-8 parser and the results are correct.\n\n> Your argument in today's mail was that SPV would be less reliable, which led to my confusion. If you're SPV, then the latter ('I was fooled by an invalid transaction') will always be the case\n\nOK, I guess the cause of the confusion is becoming clearer now. I've been describing the consequences for different security models without being sufficiently explicit.\n\nConsider a merchant node. They wish to have full security and full decentralisation, so run a full node. If a merchant doesn't upgrade and then calculates an incorrect ledger, they might sell real goods or services based on a transaction that their node said was good, but which actually violated a new rule. Their ledger is corrupted and payment fraud can be the result.\n\nConsider an SPV wallet. It follows the highest work chain. A miner who has not upgraded receives a transaction that violates the new rule, doesn't realise, and includes it anyway. Their block is broadcast. The block is not valid, but because some nodes haven't upgraded it propagates around for a while and some SPV nodes see it. Some user looks at their screen and sees that the payment they just received has one confirmation. Perhaps they're doing an in person currency trade and hand over dollars or euros in cash when they see that. The fraudster leaves, then a few minutes later the transaction goes back from one confirm to zero. \n\nIn both cases payment fraud is the result. In the first case the merchants node calculated a wrong ledger, in the second case a miner did and the SPV wallet believed it. The outcome is the same.\n\n> People started using Bitcoin based on some set of assumptions and expectations. Hard forks can change those assumptions and expectations while soft forks can't\n\nI know you may have been told that, but it's not true.\n\nA soft fork could easily break all kinds of basic rules, like giving an appointed Core Developer the power to arbitrarily create money from nothing, or destroy other people's. You'd do it like this:\n\n* Redefine an OP_NOP to a new opcode, call it OP_CONTROL_LEDGER. The arguments are a set of edits to the ledger and a signature from a blessed Core Developer key.\n* Once enough miners support the change, the new Ben Bernanke creates a transaction that moves a tiny amount of money from his own wallet back to himself, and creates an output with a single OP_CONTROL_LEDGER instruction in it.\n* Because it's a soft fork, anyone can create an input that connects to that output and old nodes will see it as just a regular spend of a tiny amount of money. But those blocks will eventually be orphaned out by upgraded miners. When new nodes see the core developer spend that output though, signed by the special key, they will directly modify the ledger according to the instructions as seen within the argument.\n\nThis would directly undermine one of the most basic promises Bitcoin makes, and it can be done with a soft fork.

Bitcoin nodes always have to be backwards compatible in order to do the initial block chain download: old data understood by new software. Same as Word 2000 being able to load documents made by Word 95.\n\nForwards compatibility is when Word 95 can load documents made by Word 2000, even though it doesn\'t understand the new features. Usually you have some form of graceful degradation involved: things don\'t work quite right, but they work well enough for you to get something done ..... sometimes.\n\nForwards compatibility with a word processor can be useful for users who don\'t want to pay for an upgrade right away and can tolerate having flaky/incomplete interoperability with other users. In a financial system like Bitcoin you are inherently interacting with other users by checking their transactions, so you can\'t avoid that. But flaky/incomplete interoperability can make the difference between "I caught this fraud attempt against me" and "I was fooled by an invalid transaction".\n\nIn fairness, when I have raised these arguments on the bitcoin-development mailing list in the past, the response has been to tweak things to try and make soft forks more like hard forks. But this just leads to the question of: why bother? What benefits do soft forks have? Running a Bitcoin node that calculates a ledger that\'s only mostly correct, most of the time doesn\'t seem like a good idea.

This upgrade would let a single person spend existing - and perceived to be spendable - money while others can\'t. Not the same.\n\nBut regardless, I would think the rollout of such an upgrade be referred to as a 51% attack, not a soft fork. The system is vulnerable to this in any case. What\'s protecting the system from the feared only-ruler-can-spend-backward-compatible-output-upgrade is the economic majority being against it and majority of miners being honest, not whether or not we use soft forks or hard forks to roll out an upgrade.

It also gives you an ['xpubkey', or 'public parent key'](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki#Public_parent_key_rarr_public_child_key) which you can use to generate a unique and unlinked (from the outside) *public key* (but no private key - yet) for each person wishing to send you money. It's safer to store this key on a potentially unsafe server, because the public parent key (as opposed to the private parent key) does not allow you to generate private (child) keys - in other words, when the this public seed gets stolen, your money is still safe ^(although you should still move it).\n\nSo the idea is: You have your private seed, and you secure it as usual. You have your public parent key, you stick it on the server you're using to get donations, and you generate addresses out of it when someone wants to pay you.

The point is, this is the kind of answer that I am looking for - a step by step procedure on how to modify blockchain, not an abstract, metaphorical description about how blockchain works.\n': 4, "> 2) Miner receives the program and implement it during their mining process.\n\nBest scenario would be if no one argues against new developer's hardfork.\n\nBut as I said in YouTube comment: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPIvqJsCOSo miners are not the only necessary people to update - except for miners, nodes are important too. When Bitcoin just begun, 1st year there was no mobile or web wallets, so the only type of wallet was a Win32 program called **Bitcoin Core** which was maintained and developed by Satoshi Nakamoto and Gavin Andersen (main developer assigned by Satoshi Nakamoto those days). 2 years later Satoshi disappeared from forums and Gavin (public person) kept working on project, new mobile wallets appeared and mobile SPV wallets which has a difference from Bitcoin Core that you don't have to download the whole blockchain (45 gb today afaik).\n\nWithout nodes there's no way for miners to request information in blockchain, the same way you can't download a movie over torrent if there's no seeds. Basically nodes are like seeds in torrents and in fact download the blockchain in a similar way. \n\nBut when your phone receiving someone's payment to your Bitcoin address, here's the way it happened:\n\n- There's a list of unconfirmed transactions consisting all payments happened since last block (usually it is a transactions for last 10 minutes, because blocks are coming every 10 minutes)\n\n- This list is created by nodes. Those nodes are collecting those transactions from all computers, all smartphones, even if you managed to write a program that sends transactions on 10 year old outdated Symbian smartphone with 128megabyte memory on SD card, this smartphone can sign and send those payments to the network.\n\n- If you have bitcoins you can spend them by broadcasting everyone message\n\n- So every computer globally gets that list, everyone has the same version on which transactions appeared on the net for the last 10 minutes.\n\n- If 1 node gathered a list of 500 transactions, while neighboring node gathered 800 transactions, then node is going to synchronize with that node to add missing 300 transactions, but before adding those 300 list and pass it to other nodes, that node is going to check with blockchain whether the transaction is valid - by checking the balance of sender through blockchain, by checking if the transaction is belongs to the owner (every single transaction in bitcoin has a signature generated by owner, and this signature can be checked by anyone without revealing private key of the owner)\n\n- When new block comes, all unconfirmed transactions become confirmed and being included to a global ledger\n": 1, "Or:\n\nA group of people are in a room.

Whoever rolls a 1 first gets a poker chip from a pile of unique chips and can write in the book the chip they won and write down any trades people are doing. It continues as people get many poker chips. All the people can trade by announcing who is getting their chips by telling them the chip serial number (broadcast transaction) but some whisper trades for chips already spoken for (double spend). The winner of the dice rolls gets another chip and writes down all the trades they heard and are recorded in the book as long as it's a valid trade. (confirmations) People slowly invest in more dice to win more chips but to keep the pace of distributing chips the same the people eventually have to get two 1's and then three 1's.

": 1, "> Is it possible that Alice may not be able to accept a transaction from Bob if they are using different softwares?\n\nYes.\n\nA transaction contains a version number (which I think is included in the transaction's signatures) but a hard fork doesn't have to force this to increase. If the fork doesn't require this to be updated then the transaction is valid on both forks. But someone could double spend, ie send coins to 1 address on 1 fork and the same coins to another address on the other fork. The 2 chains will also diverge naturally as they will have different mined coins. As these mined coins mix with all the other coins more transactions will be valid on only 1 fork.": 1, 'Bravo, this is simpler than anything I could think of.

For that, the buyer would pay an extra of, say, 20%, on top of the exchange rate at the time of payment. Then, the bitcoins would be released to the seller according to the exchange rate at the release time, and the spare coins would be sent back to the buyer as change. This would protect the seller against volatility of up to 20% (or whichever number the buyer/seller are comfortable with).\n\nWith that model, the buyer would take the volatility on himself. If bitcoin dropped in price, it falls on the buyer. OTOH, if bitcoin raised in price, the buyer would end up taking some profit, too.\n\nSome more advanced models could allow splitting the volatility risk between the buyer and seller, rather than them falling solely on one party.\n\nAnother, more complex, alternative is to integrate a CFD market into our payment system, which would (given a liquid enough market) eliminate the volatility risk altogether, and shift the burden of dealing with it from the our users to professional traders who are more equipped for that.\n\n(I'm Nadav, the founder of Bitrated)": 1, 'That\'s a phenomenal answer!

In the US, we have one of the easiest ways to buy BTC. There is a company that sells BTC in thousands of retailers across the country for cash only. It took me about 5 minutes to sign up and 10 minutes to drive to the nearest participating retailer. You walk in, tell them what you are buying and how much you want, hand them the cash and they hand you a receipt. On that receipt is a PIN code. The person who wants the BTC enters that PIN code into a web site and the Bitcoin address where they want the BTC deposited. Because you pay in cash, the BTC is available immediately. I usually don't leave the store until the transfer starts in Mycelium. \n\nFees? 0% for the first $1,000 purchased, 1% after that. Dead serious. There are buying limits, however. $1,000 a day and $2,500 a week, so it would have taken three people to get it done in one day, two people in two days, or your Mom would have had to make two purchases 7 days apart if she did it alone. Of course, buying $2,485 (for $2,500) in two days would already beat the amount lost in the wire transfer, with another $496 (for $500) coming next week. \n\nYour Mom could have sent you each PIN code for you to claim the BTC using her login or she could likely have done it herself. There are only two fields to complete. If she wanted to do it, you'd have to give her the deposit address to copy and paste into the form if you trusted her to get it right.

For example, hear is how it reads (http://fermatslibrary.com/s/ideal-poker-and-asymptotically-ideal-poker):\n\n>So I wish to present the argument that various interest and groups, notably including PSFTFBICIADOJ has sold to the players a \xe2\x80\x9cquasi-doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d which teaches, in effect, that  \xe2\x80\x9cless is more\xe2\x80\x9d or that (in other words) \xe2\x80\x9craked poker is better than not raked poker\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\n> let us define \xe2\x80\x9cPSFTCIAFBICIA \xe2\x80\x9cto be descriptive of a \xe2\x80\x9cschool of thought" that originated at the time of Black Friday on April 15 2011. Then, more specifically, a \xe2\x80\x9cPSFTCIAFBICIA " would favor the existence of a \xe2\x80\x9cmanipulative" state establishment of raked poker and poker skin which would continuously seek to achieve \xe2\x80\x9craked" objectives with comparatively little regard for the long term reputation of the poker currency and the associated effects of that on the reputation of poker sites domestic to the state\n\n> In the near future there may be a smaller number of major sites used in the world and these may stand in competitive relations among themselves. There is now the \xe2\x80\x9ceuro" sites and the old history of the UB scandal is past history now. And there COULD be introduced, for example, a similar international site for the Islamic world or for South Asia, or for South America, or here or there. \n\n\nAnd the conclusion:\n\n>There perhaps will always be \xe2\x80\x9crake", like also \xe2\x80\x9cdeath and taxes". But it is sometimes remarkable how poker strategies can evolve. And in relation to that I think that it is possible that \xe2\x80\x9cPSFTCIAFBIDOJ " are like a political faction that will become less influential as a result of poker revolution. The \xe2\x80\x9cPSFTCIAFBIDOJ\xe2\x80\x9d view of things did not come into existence until after the time when what we can call \xe2\x80\x9cBlack Friday" had become established in the US. And by this label we wish to differentiate between any theoretical or ideal concept of justice and the actual form of governing regime structure that came to exercise state power on the poker community. (All over the world varieties of sites make claims to have systems very properly or even ideally devoted to the interests of the professional or recreational players of those sites and always an externally located critic can argue that the site is actually a sort of despotism.)\n\n>PSFTCIAFBIDOJ implicitly always have the argument that some good managers can do things of beneficial value, operating with the skins, and that it is not needed or appropriate for the players or the \xe2\x80\x9ccustomers" of the chips supplied by the site to actually understand, while the managers are managing, what exactly they are doing and how it will affect the \xe2\x80\x9cROI" circumstances of these players.\n\n >I see this as analogous to how the PSFTCIAFBIDOJ were claiming to provide something much better than Ponzi schemes that they could not deny existed in all other sites. But in the end the \xe2\x80\x9cdictatorship of the proletariat\xe2\x80\x9d seemed to become rather exposed as simply the dictatorship of the regime. So there may be an analogy to this as regards those called \xe2\x80\x9cPSFTCIAFBIDOJ\xe2\x80\x9d in that while they have claimed to be operating for high and noble objectives of general poker welfare what is clearly true is that they have made it easier for their sites to \xe2\x80\x9cprint money". \n\n>So I see the entire privately raked community as in a weak sense comparable to the \xe2\x80\x9cPSFTCIAFBIDOJ " because of the support of both parties for a certain \xe2\x80\x9clack of transparency" relating to the functions of poker sites as seen by the players. And for both of them it can be said that they tend to think in terms of sites operating in a benevolent fashion that is, however, beyond the comprehension of the player of the raked sites. And this parallel makes it seem not implausible that a process of poker revolution might lead to the expectation on the part of players in the \xe2\x80\x9cgreat game types" that they should be better situated to be able to understand whatever will be the rake policies which, indeed, are typically of great importance to players who may have alternative options for where to place their \xe2\x80\x9cdeposits".\n\n\n': 1, 'My understanding is this implementation provides a solution for the decentralization of cards and gameflow, but not yet necessarily a practical disrupt-er of centralized gaming.\n\nIt would be nice to have dialogue on this subject though...': 2, 'ty': 1, 'I have solved this problem FAR beyond what you are are suggesting here ;) https://thewealthofchips.wordpress.com/2015/06/15/3194/': 1, 'Been waiting for this for a long time.
