It would still suck though: IMHO the password never should hit a regular computer which has a harddisk, the probability of it leaking to disk is too high.

The proof of burn is to help put a "rating" or give you another indicator towards a persons identity and intent.\n\nIf someone burned thousands of dollars on their identity, then they are obviously ready to conduct serious business and want people to know that.': 1, 'Why should a legitimate business have to outbid a fraudulent business? Buying a reputation is still bad.': 1, 'Proof of Burn doesn\'t necessarily favor early adopters. Anyone can buy Bitcoins and burn them, it\'s just whatever they\'re willing to burn to prove their identity has good intentions.\n\nI don\'t believe any transaction using Bitcoin should ever be conducted without a multi-sig escrow. There is just simply no reason not to use escrow. Escrow eliminates nearly 99% of scams and frauds and deters most evil doers from the beginning. Although escrow still cannot combat or prevent charge back fraud, which is a whole problem of itself in the financial sector.\n\nThe people with large stashes of Bitcoin are not in any advantage here, it would be the same concept for people with large stashes of cash. It\'s just whatever they\'re willing to burn on their identity.\n\nThe main benefit to proof of burn is almost to act as an extra filter. I would much rather commence conversations or dealings with a person who has "burned" in their identity. They have spent money in order to establish their identity and reputation, which money they are unable to retrieve back. It\'s in their best interest to handle their reputation accordingly or otherwise it will become worthless.\n\nA Person who has commenced a "proof-of-burn" on their identity has more to lose if their reputation is hurt rather than a person who hasn\'t "burned" in their identity. That is pretty much the bottom line to my idea and argument, and I see it as a great useful tool.\n\nSites such as Keybase and OneName.io could easily implement this feature and could show through the blockchain which identities have committed to "burning".\n\nThe fact of the matter is, there are a lot of bullshitters out here in the world of Bitcoin. Everyone with a WordPress website is a CEO and their best friend is lead Developer. If someone is serious about Bitcoin or their identity/reputation, let them put some money on it. I\'m tired of dealing with kids and wannabe businessmen.': 1, 'Can\'t this system be abused by people who didn\'t pay anything for their bitcoins? \n\nThe majority of bitcoins at this date are owned by people who paid pennies for them. They can just go ahead and burn ten times as many as their competitors to establish an identity, rip off all kinds of people and then people will simply say, "no, it\'s obvious they are trustworthy merchants who are simply the victims of a smear campaign! Otherwise, who would destroy $[x] worth of bitcoins! So much reputation they paid for!" And if the bad actor we\'re talking about is even moderately motivated, she can simply spend more bitcoins to create more identities - sockpuppets which network and reinforce each other\'s reputation - especially when the threshold is so ridiculously low, as in your example of 10 bitcoin. \n\nDoesn\'t really make sense to me. Greatly rewards early adopters with 10,000btc wallets (there are hundreds of these people) and punishes new entrants in to the marketplace. \n\nedit: but my reservations aside, thank you for not mentioning changetip in your post!': 3, "This isn't a mandatory means of identity and reputation. It's just something else another user can look at, much like reviews and trust ratings.\n\nI'm more willing to trust someone that has invested in their reputation rather than someone who hasn't.\n\nThere is fraud and con men everywhere, there is no denying it. This is just another tool that will help indicate someone's intentions and it's by no means 100% effective or even 50%. If someone is going to do bad it just will cost them a little bit more.\n\nA legitimate business doesn't have to outbid a fraudulent business, plus when the fraudulent business goes under, so does their money they burned.\n\nYou're not buying a reputation, you are merely showing that you are trustworthy and have good intentions. If someone burns $100, then I feel as if I can trust them with a $5 or $10. Someone that doesn't burn $100, I'm not as likely to trust.": 1, "Butterfly Labs paid over $10,000 to rewrite three articles on buttcoin.org so they would look legitimate. They paid $1,000 for a small banner ad on bitcointalk.org so they would look legitimate. That legitimacy could have easily been bought with any kind of currency, real or virtual.\n\nThat fake legitimacy earned them tens of millions of dollars in cash, and it if weren't for STATIST SHILLS reporting them to the FTC they would have been able to keep that money.\n\nSo, let's do a little math: if tens of thousands of dollars in advertisements resulted in tens of millions of dollars in income, what's the rate of return? Answer: at least 100,000%\n\n**tl;dr buying a fake reputation is worth it**": 1, '>A Person who has commenced a "proof-of-burn" on their identity has more to lose if their reputation is hurt rather than a person who hasn\'t "burned" in their identity. That is pretty much the bottom line to my idea and argument, and I see it as a great useful tool.\n\nI understand your argument. It is very clear. \n\nMy counter-argument is that it is simply not as great and useful as you might think it is, because there are a fairly large group of people with lots of bitcoins who can effortlessly take advantage of this kind of system. And ironically enough, kids and wannabe businessmen are the exact kind of people who ended up at the bitcoin.org/forum back in the day and who are the the top 500 richlist. \n\nThey don\'t even need to be bad dudes. There just needs to be one bad dude with lots of bitcoin and lots of time. Let\'s assume that a reputational proof-of-burn system comes into wide usage. People are willing to trust the system; it\'s working well enough that people semi-trust it. Then, someone figures out a scheme in which he can make eleven bitcoins out of a ten-bitcoin burn. The details of that scheme I\'ll leave up to you - it\'s bitcoin, after all, 25% of the economy is actually pure scamming - but once that happens, it\'s all over. \n\nFor instance, if [whoever controls this address](http://bitcoinrichlist.com/address/1LdRcdxfbSnmCYYNdeYpUnztiYzVfBEQeC?charttype=balance) decides to go rogue and start ripping people off, she could create 5800 identities. That\'s a lot of mistrust to dump into the system. And in the end, when someone starts abusing the common trust like this, only the honest actor gets punished. You\'d have honest vendors who committed real capital to the proof-of-burn system which is no longer in favour, and they survive on their reputation. But they would have survived anyway because they are good businesspeople with products people want! \n\nI think you idea is sound in principle, but in reality it needs to be implemented with a tool which is more suited to the task. Traditionally, being a normal person in a business suit and having a normal, real, online profile has been the benchmark of trustworthiness. I\'m not trying to slag bitcoin too much but perhaps it\'s just better to admit that the arena attracts sketchy people due to the nature of the technology, that decentralized trust mechanisms are inherently difficult, and that certain aspects of life aren\'t meant to be foisted off to the blockchain. \n\n': 1, 'Right, but there are many circumstances in which one might burn "thousands of dollars" to establish themselves to make tens of thousands of dollars in immediate, irrevocable bitcoin sales. Darknet markets spring to mind.\n\nAnd there are many, many people with large stashes of bitcoin which they basically didn\'t pay anything for. \n\nBut I agree, everything helps in establishing a web of trust. I\'m simply saying, moving to a proof-of-burn type system disproportionately rewards early adopters and utterly punishes people who paid the current market rate for their bitcoins.

We\'re discussing what the killer or breakthrough implementation of Bitcoin is.\n\nIn order to determine what Bitcoin\'s "killer app" (if there even is one, and not just a number of very successful or helpful apps), we need to look at what Bitcoin can do that other currencies cannot. The app would have to be so good that people are willing to convert their existing funds to Bitcoin in order to use it. \n\nI don\'t personally think a standard tipping service is this. It\'s a step in the right direction, but it\'s not going to cause people who don\'t own bitcoin to buy bitcoin. Instead, I feel like funds just become trapped in the tipping economy and are rotated around from user to user with nobody cashing out for a purpose.\n\nSo if micropayments are part of the solution that Bitcoin provides, the other half then is harnessing the power of combined micropayment towards unified goals versus arbitrary and typically ineffective donations spread widely to people who don\'t want them or are ignorant of its value. We shouldn\'t\' have to explain "This is bitcoin, here\'s 3 cents". The goal should be to have people ask "How was this funded with Bitcoin? I thought it was a scam."\n\nCrowdfunding has become an increasingly popular platform and Bitcoin is ideal for it because the blockchain acts as the trusted third party that would typically be held by Kickstarter, IndieGoGo, etc. Tipping Tuesday is simply an indicator that people want to be able to spread small sums of bitcoin towards collective efforts to the enrich Bitcoin as a whole.\n\nThere are plenty of industries that operate on the model of the people at the top of industry hold the money, they decide what they like to invest towards and then they fund it, making their money back when they sell the product to the public.
