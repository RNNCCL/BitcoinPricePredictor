Like, on par with "an undercover cop has to tell you they\'re an undercover cop" level of ludicrous. Sure, they have to tie the real person to the online persona with evidence, but they have to do that for every aspect of a crime. If what you\'re saying is true, I think Kevin Mitnick would be very interested in hearing it.\n* They don\'t have just circumstantial evidence. There is **a lot** of evidence they\'ve gathered that Ross=DPR. This is what a lot of the trial will center around.\n\nAs far as your personal beliefs, I have a few thoughts on that as well.

He\'s not a hero, he\'s a tinpot drug kingpin whose ineptness is comical.

Ross wasn\'t concerned with \'taking violence out of the drug trade and bankrupting the drug cartels\'. \n\nWhen the opportunity seemingly arose, he leapt at the chance to directly enter into a partnership with drug cartels (Hell\'s Angels). He tried to have 3 innocent people **murdered** because they committed the crime of living with someone he thought scammed him. Not only murder them because they stood in his way, but because he wanted to take their property as recompense for what he thought was rightfully his. \n\nThe Silk Road has left plenty of victims in its wake. Do you think the victims of the hacking tools and programs sold on the Silk Road are somehow not victims? Do you think anybody injured or killed by a weapon illegally procured through The Armory (a Silk Road offshoot he created) are somehow not victims? Do you think the wife and children of the ex-employee he thought he had assassinated are not victims?\n\nEven the claim of \'lowering violence\' is dubious at best. There is no evidence that the Silk Road impacted street level drug dealing at all. In fact, there\'s plenty of evidence that street level dealers bought their product OFF OF SILK ROAD to sell on the streets. Drug cartels absolutely rejoiced at the concept of Silk Road, the elimination of middle men benefits them more than anyone.\n\nI think you could benefit from looking at what Ross Ulbricht actually did through a critical eye instead of an ideological one.': 2, "Not exactly sure how that applies.

I've been around since late 2010, but I believe Bitcoin is irrevocably flawed and has no long term future (even the speculative attraction is gone at this point).\n\nYou say in another post you're thinking of getting into mining. That would be an extremely unwise decision at the moment even if you know what you're doing. Cex.io just announced they are turning off their machines, probably because it's at the point where just the electricity cost exceeds rewards.\n\nMost miners are probably on the verge of turning off their machines, as there's not a single machine that can avoid making a loss on electricity cost alone at $100 with electricity being $0.10/kWh.\n\nTo be competitive in mining today you have to rent out warehouses in places where electricity costs per kWh are the lowest possible (i.e. $0.04/kWh). \n\nWith mining, you are unlikely to break even on the cost of the mining machine itself by the end of it. You're better off just buying BTC and speculating on a price rise - you'd get the same result whichever way it goes, but without all the hassle of mining.\n\nMining hasn't been worthwhile in a long time. It used to be, because in the times CPUs and GPUs were viable, you could mine with them and when they would become useless to mine with, you could just use for gaming/general use as you had always done. They would also retain their resale value pretty well better than ASICs do, because you can use a GPU for gaming - but what can you use an ASIC for? A heater?\n\nThe last time I mined was about a year ago during the altcoin boom when GPU mining suddenly became a lot more profitable again.\n\nThese days, altcoins probably aren't nowhere near as profitable as they were, but if you're still intent on going into mining, it would be a good idea to use your GPU or even CPU in some cases to mine an altcoin to get an idea of whats involved in mining and what it's like.\n\nThere's a bit of a learning curve (i.e. creating settings for a batch file and saving it), but nothing too difficult. Mining these days is basically just \n\n1. Setting up an account on a website (a mining 'pool')\n2. Downloading a mining program (i.e. CGminer for GPUs)\n3.

Even gamer\'s PCs with high end graphics cards stopped being useful by the end of 2012.\n\nBut, if you want some (useless) numbers to share ...  the average household computer (not a gamer PC) has a GPU that will do under 100 Mh/s.   So to get 1 Gh/s you need 10 household computers.   To get 306,926,000 Gh/s you need more than 3 billion "household computers" mining to equal the total amount of Bitcoin mining occurring today.\n\nFor reference, a single $1,400 AntMiner S4 miner does 2Th/s, equal to 20,000 of the "household computers" I describe above.
