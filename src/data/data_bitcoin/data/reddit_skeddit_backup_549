Most people will say you can make jewelry out of it.  Fair enough - it has an additional use, which gives it value.  But that\'s only a tiny fraction of its value - the rest is as a store of wealth and (less these days) a medium of exchange.  \n\nTo come to my point, why does something need *two* uses to have value?  It doesn\'t it only needs one.  Bitcoin has one - its use as a medium of exchange (or, maybe more precisely, as a means of using the Bitcoin network).  That use is what gives it value.  Fiat currency the same - the utility as a means of exchange (including for paying taxes) gives it value.\n\nTL;DR: things are backed by their intrinsic value, and utility for exchange is the intrinsic value of bitcoin (and fiat).': 12, "True.

This risk is just greater for bitcon than for almost every currency.\n\n> The instability of bitcoin is mostly due to the fact that the current market is dominated by speculators, but that's a function of this moment in time, not an attribute of bitcoin itself.\n\nIt is by no means clear that increased use would stabilize the value.  If the price starts to go up again near 1000 USD, many investors will start buying again, anticipating a rally, which will self-create one.  The percentage of coins locked up by speculators with increase, leaving a smaller pool of coins to serve the increased volume of e-payments, which will raise the price even more.

If the time frame is a couple of months -- say, between monthly payday and spending all of it, or investing on other things, before the next payday -- then ordinary currencies, whether paper or in banks, are usually trustworthy enough, even in countries with chronic 5-10% inflation.  However, a currency that has a high probability of losing 10% of its value in one month is not suitable, even on that time scale.\n\nFor a time frame of a year or two, a curency with 5% inflation would be unacceptable.  A currency with 1-2% inflation may be acceptable if the goal is merely to store value, but since there are many alternatives with similar risks but yielding profits instad fo losses, there is no reason to keep large amounts of currency, whether paper or in banks.  Stocks of solid companies are a popular choice: the main risk is that the company fails for internal or external cause.  Shares of solid funds or bonds of stable governments are also OK, with similar risks.\n\nFor investment of a decade or more, even 3% of inflation per year would erode too much of the value, and the risk of the currency collapsing in the meantime is not negligible, even if ithas been stable in the past decade or two.\n\nFor that application, one could use financial instruments rom really solid banks or governments that are guaranteed by them to compensate for inflation.   Then the main risk would be those entities being unable to fulfill that promise.  Gold funds also have that risk, namely the fund may be unable to issue the gold, or its equivalent market value in currency; but also has the risk that the market  price of gold may collapse.  Another alternative is durable material goods, like real estate; then the main risks are the goods being stolen or destroyed, or losing value because of progress.\n\nBitcoin\'s probelm is not that is has "no backing" specifically, but more generally that there is no guarantee that it will preserve its value, on any time scale.
