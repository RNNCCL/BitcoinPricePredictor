It could enable tiny fractions of bitcoin to be embedded, at virtually no cost, into almost any internet activity.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe internet has never had economics properly embedded into it,\xe2\x80\x9d says Mr Ehrsam, a former Goldman Sachs trader. \xe2\x80\x9cSay you pay one one-hundredth of a cent to send an email, spam email dies overnight. Who would bulk create a bajillion Yahoo email accounts? It is no longer economically viable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMr Ehrsam is unsurprisingly bullish on the utility of the blockchain, but he is hardly alone. Developers are experimenting with using the blockchain to speed up the settlement of stock trades, to process by-the-second payments for peer-to-peer video streaming, and to create marketplaces or social networks that operate without a central authority, plus hundreds more potential applications.\n\nMore than $390m of venture capital funding has flowed to these bitcoin experiments so far this year, according to researchers at bitcoin news site Coindesk, already eclipsing the $360m that was invested last year.\n\nCoinbase can afford to be neutral on what uses eventually emerge. It styles itself as the \xe2\x80\x9con-ramp to the bitcoin world\xe2\x80\x9d, providing customers \xe2\x80\x94 both ordinary users and merchants who want to accept payment in it \xe2\x80\x94 with a way to exchange money into bitcoin and to store and transfer their virtual currency.\n\nThe company boasts 2.4m users in 25 countries, and a roster of backers that include leading venture capital firms, such as Union Square Ventures and Andreessen Horowitz, and some established financial institutions including banks BBVA and USAA, and the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nIt is a long way from the anarchic chat forums and anti-government rhetoric of the early bitcoin believers to the swanky offices overlooking downtown San Francisco where Coinbase has its headquarters. The company will soon be taking extra space to house its growing army of compliance officers, lawyers and financially savvy developers.\nWhile bitcoin may one day be embedded in all sorts of financial transactions, it is not clear if the currency will ever be a store of independent value or the alternative to fiat currencies that its pioneers dreamt it would be.\n\nBitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s blockchain catches Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s eye\n\nThe blockchain \xe2\x80\x94 the technology that underpins bitcoin \xe2\x80\x94 has been called \xe2\x80\x98the future for financial services infrastructure\xe2\x80\x99. Banks, clearing houses and exchanges are becoming increasingly excited that it could fundamentally transforming their business models.\n\nCoinbase made a nod in that direction this month, though, in a publicity stunt surrounding the Greek debt crisis. It waived fees for euro-to-bitcoin transactions, and Mr Ehrsam says there was a 300 per cent spike in trading volume.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWith Cyprus and now this, there is a growing awareness and understanding of what it really means to have money in your bank account,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr Ehrsam says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve now had two countries in the eurozone where all of a sudden you actually can\xe2\x80\x99t access your money and somebody could haircut it by 30 per cent and turn it into something else and you have no control over that.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMr Ehrsam straddles the financial and the tech worlds, like a human metaphor for bitcoin. His stint on a Goldman currency trading desk smooths Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s dealings with banks, while his teenage years as a US champion gamer, sponsored by hardware companies to appear at tournaments, give him geek credibility in San Francisco.

Once the absolute value of the debt between two nodes exceeded the size of a Mojo token, the side with the negative balance would transfer a token to the other, clearing out the debt.

If you wanna look at who invented bitcoin you need to look back to early 90s and cypherpunks (not to be confused with cyberpunks) and the extropians. People like Nick Szabo, Adam Back, Hal Finny, David Chaum etc\n\nYou should read the cypherpunk menefesto (google it, easy to find) They have been trying to make bitcoin for like 20 years! Satoshi is just a fake name they picked for the person who would reveal it to the world! If you\'re going up against the banks, would you want your name out there?! HELL FUCKING NO. they are very smart people!\n\nHere.. wanna have some fun with this? Wanna go down the rabbit hole? Let me help you with some fuuuuun research.\n\nLet\'s start with some history:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRPOW\xe2\x80\x9d was added on top of Adam Back\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHashCash\xe2\x80\x9d. (This is how Hal Finney created the solution for the Byzantine General\xe2\x80\x99s Problem which allowed BitGold/Bitcoin to be completed). http://cryptome.org/rpow.htm\n\nIt seems BitCoin was then mostly created in the comment sections of the "Nanobarter", "BitGold" & "BitGold-Markets" papers(look at "url\'s" for correct dates). http://szabo.best.vwh.net/scarce.html http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2007/06/nanobarter.html?m=1 http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2005/12/bit-gold.html?m=1 http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2008/04/bit-gold-markets.html?m=1\n\n2007 Szabo applies BitGold and his "Scarce Object" theory to Zookos p2p hard drive project.\n\nSzabo: "One possible answer to central mint vulnerability is bit gold -- a currency the value of which does not depend on any particular trusted third party. ANOTHER alternative is (an object barter economy"Scarce Objects")." Note: Put these all together and you have Bitcoin.... http://web.archive.org/web/20070625154046/http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20070618142414/http://szabo.best.vwh.net/scarce.html\n\nNote: The relation between Zooko and Jim McCoy needs to be understood.....Zooko is just using Jim\'s earlier work to create a new system using parts of MojoNation. Understand that Jim McCoy is the real "Drive" behind the creation of these type of schemes. McCoy has spent most of his life and millions of his own dollars in trying to find the best scheme for his MojoNation ideas.(That\'s right, he\'s ritch.)\n\nSzabo quote: "I\'m sure you and Jim can make better guesses than I in this regard, and I\'d love to hear them, but I can suggest a general approach. My approach would be to start with some possible proxy measures of what users find valuable in backup services: gigabytes, reliability, timeliness, etc. Choice(s) of proxy measure are worth quite a bit of brainstorming and experimentation because the best proxy measures may be highly non-obvious."\n\nSzabo and Jim McCoy relation: http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2007/06/nanobarter.html?m=1\n\nJim McCoy quoye:\n\n"I\'d be quite interested in more detail about what you tried to implement and how it compares to what I have proposed....At some point we should sync up over vast quantities of alcohol and I can describe various approaches that were proposed, implemented, or abandoned."\n\nNick Szabo quote: "Jim, I do appreciate your comments, and I\'d love to learn more over beer (but not until August -- bar exam :-)."\n\n"I have extensively studied barter and money systems (in addition to working for David Chaum and playing a major role setting up a certificate authority) and do believe I have some insights."\n\nQuotes from Cryddit (aka Ray Dillinger "Bear" original cypherpunk-mentored by Tim C. May himself)\n\n"Speaking as someone who reviewed some of his code in late 2008, I think I can express a pretty strong opinion that it was probably written by one person."\n\n"As for comments, he rarely used one word where none would do. His comments were mostly limited to notes to himself to do stuff later or resolve design issues, not explanations. In itself, not unusual, but again, you wouldn\'t find it completely consistent across a project by multiple people."\n\n"I should clarify this last. What I mean is that people who are coding as part of a team usually use comments to explain the code they\'re writing to the other members of the team. So-called "lone wolf" programmers making something all by themselves usually are in the habit of not needing to explain anything to anyone so they don\'t."\n\nSatoshi states early in the mailing list that he did it backwards, writing code first then writing the white paper:\n\n"I appreciate your questions. I actually did this kind of backwards. I had to write all the code before I could convince myself that I could solve every problem, then I wrote the paper. I think I will be able to release the code sooner than I could write a detailed spec. You\'re already right about most of your assumptions where you filled in the blanks." ~ Satoshi Nakamoto http://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography%40metzdowd.com/msg09980.html\n\nSomeone else who had this habbit to code first with no white paper and very little notes:\n\nJim McCoy quote: "A lot of our various ideas and implementation changes were either lost when whiteboards were re-tasked (at one point we were actually using polaroid snapshots of whiteboards to maintain internal history Smiley or never explained even in the code........no one really had the inclination to write up white papers or discuss design decisions in email, so we ended up leaving less of a digital trail than anyone would have liked."\n\nJim McCoy History: http://www.salon.com/2000/10/09/mojo_nation/"': 14, 'Yea, spam was already becoming a problem before the e-commerce floodgates were lifted.

They were not. Ross committed no real fraud I am aware of.\n\n>He's not innocent like you make him out to be.\n\nI did not make him out to be innocent.

I think its entirely reasonable for the media to portray things like that since there has been so much "criminal" activity surrounding bitcoin. I\'m not trying to play semantic games. I\'m just being logical.\n\nI think the way to promote bitcoin to the masses and overcome those stimgas is education, education, education. Bitcoin was basically kick started because SilkRoad required its use. The SilkRoad made bitcoin famous. That\'s a fact. I don\'t mind that. Bitcoin would not be anywhere near where it is today in terms of adoption if not for SilkRoad.
