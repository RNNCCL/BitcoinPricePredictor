A full chat system) that uses the Bitcoin p2p network as its transport, by encoding messages as p2p Bitcoin alerts.\n\nI did eventually come up with a solution to that, but it was overly complicated, and I opted to just scrap the idea instead.

Please let people know they are a bullshit scam.', 41): {"Here is a summary I posted of all the points I can think of which have developed over the past year with Onecon (with a few revised edits).\n\nI wrote this to the guys who posted the supposed \xe2\x80\x9cexpose\xe2\x80\x9d on BMLM \xe2\x80\x93 which really has little meaning or substance, anyway (OP: remove/ edit this post as you deem fit)\n\nHello Ted Nuyten, Ken Labine, John Reilly and any Onecoin affiliates. I\xe2\x80\x99d like to have a friendly conversation, but definitely address a few things.\n\n1.) Ted (Author of the article), you claim that in regards to Behind MLM that \xe2\x80\x9d in 90% of all cases their biased \xe2\x80\x93 false conclusion is the same: It\xe2\x80\x99s a pyramid, a ponzi or a recruitment scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSurely you might give at least A FEW examples? I would be particularly interested to see ANY Onecoin information which they have presented which you (or OC) is able to refute? I would assume that OC affiliates could certainly point to one or more of such reference sources.\n\nThe first article (*Behind MLM) wrote on Onecoin in late 2014 has well over 1,200 comments on it now. Behind MLM has written about Onecoin discrepancies DOZENS of times. With sooooo many accusations, you should have no problem finding a few \xe2\x80\x9clies\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfalse conclusions.\xe2\x80\x9d I challenge you to list just one or two.\n\n2.) you also state that, \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6.A number of companies want to sue BehindMLM.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWant to sue\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chave sued\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chave attempted to sue,\xe2\x80\x9d are an entirely different claim. A lawsuit can only be realized if there is proven defamation via misdirected slander and/ or libel.\n\n3.) IF Onecoin were so concerned about negative media pressure from Behind MLM, Cointelegraph (the #1 crypto and \xe2\x80\x98alt-coin\xe2\x80\x99 media source in the world) and so many others, why are they purposefully trying to deceive and make such scrutiny so easy?\n\nPLETHERA OF BAD EXAMPLES, *BAD ACTING (& history since inception):\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBetter than bitcoin\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 yet zero utility, no evidence of the technology behind it, whatsoever. *Like, \xe2\x80\x9cWe will be the next Google!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 sheer words with no substance, by themselves.\n\nNigel Allan \xe2\x80\x93 first CEO, known ponzi criminal (so infamous Ruja had to get rid of him in Jan. last yr)\n\nSebastian Greenwood \xe2\x80\x93 Unaico, Site Talk, and other ponzi involvement\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cForbes Bulgaria cover and article\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 LIE, Paid Advert, only distribution to select OC affiliates\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFinancial IT cover and article (quarterly)\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 LIE, Paid Advert, only distribution to select OC affiliates\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOneWorld & SEVA Canada Partnership (for Blind Kids)\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 I investigated and disproved it, MYSELF. *No affiliation w/ SEVA\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cRuja is buying a number of banks\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 totally false\n\nACTUALLY, how many banks have they gone through in the past 8 months!?!?\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe sell educational material\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 plagiarised, out-of-date, available for cheap or free online. *Occam\xe2\x80\x99s Razor would suggest that, 10 to 1, what they are promoting are their ponzi points, not their education material.\n\nAND NO MATERIAL FOR MOST RECENT BIGGEST PACKAGES (*but will take money)\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cBLOCKCHAIN\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 see definition of blockchain.

They bought the Forbes cover. No one in the local cryptocurrency community takes them seriously, primarily due to their inability to prove that they know anything about cryptocurrency. They started a topic in the local Bitcoin forum BitcoinBG.eu and were simply obliterated by the knowledgeable members there.\n\nA seminar was organized a few weeks ago by Software University (a company), with the title "OneCoin - the revolutionary cryptocurrency". A few hours later, the title was changed to "Open discussion on cryptocurrencies" - they found out it was a scam. \n\nA few friends and I organize a local Bitcoin/Blockchain meetup and last time there was a person who came and wanted to talk about OneCoin. We told him that we will talk about it after we address other people\'s questions. When we finished (we talked about the fundamental ideas and technology behind Bitcoin) he was no longer willing to speak about it. He understood that we are not "fertile" ground - we just knew too much.\n\nAnyone really into cryptocurrencies will never fall for OneCoin. However, many who are flirting with this new technology are potential victims.\n\nI am not sure if this gets enough attention: [OneCoin Exposed as Ponzi Scheme](http://cointelegraph.com/news/one-coin-much-scam-onecoin-exposed-as-global-mlm-ponzi-scheme)': 10, 'Here is another great source of investigation on this scam: https://www.tyracpa.com/onecoin-is-a-scam/\n': 1, 'At least they were smart enough to seek a second opinion.': 1, 'Please go to the event and inform the people.': 3, 'I think there are a few interesting ones out there.

It is simply and painfully obvious.\n\nOne of the biggest jokes is that Ruja calls herself \xe2\x80\x9cThe Crypto Queen\xe2\x80\x9d (in some instances stating that she started following bitcoin in 2010; while in other interviews she states 2009 [note, to have participated in bitcoin in late 2009/ early 2010 you would have needed to be a very advanced computer geek, and you would know and likely be friends with MANY of the prominent players in this space \xe2\x80\x93 it has only gotten easier for common folks more recently]).\n\nI THOUGHT THIS INFORMATION AND QUOTES WOULD BE INTERESTING:\nEarlier today Ruja spoke at the \xe2\x80\x9cLive Onecoin State of the Nation Address (what is she, POTUS now?),\xe2\x80\x9d she made several more bombastic claims:\n\nRuja: \xe2\x80\x9cI am probably the most passionate person out there about cryptocurrency\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nJust LOL \xe2\x80\x93 She cannot even string together two sentences about crypto which don\xe2\x80\x99t come out awkward or outright wrong!\n\nRuja (@21:10 mark): \xe2\x80\x9cWe are at 1.7 million members now \xe2\x80\xa6.I really believe that in 3 years we will be at 10 million miners.

Because, what happens is, you will receive from the 1st of April the same amount of tokens for a higher price. So, the tokens, actually, grow in price. And we measure the mining difficulty of the coin in tokens. We want to make sure that the coin price does not grow too fast and we don\xe2\x80\x99t create a hype or a bubble or too much (unintelligible word) about the coin.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis is just crazy talk! and has no basis in technological reality.\n\nALSO: She is now quoted referring to investments, not \xe2\x80\x9ceducational packages,\xe2\x80\x9d which means their CEO is now on-record as selling unlicensed securities.\n\nRuja (7:37 mark): \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, the first miners in bitcoin got the best deal \xe2\x80\xa6(some on this webinar were early) and were mining the coins for 4 tokens per coin. Currently the mining difficulty is over 50 tokens. So, this is a very very clear opportunity that the earlier you join its a first-come, first-serve. The earlier you join, the better difficulty, the better price, you receive. And it is the same with the package price (states that package prices will be revised every three months) \xe2\x80\xa6the earlier you join Onecoin, the earlier you start the mining, the better for you. Because the more minors, and you see them every day, joining because we really have a good product out there.

My simple point is that there will not be a long term benefit for the miners to do this. If the holders are gone then so is the miners business. So yes maybe they could destroy all faith in the network but that would also mean destroying their business. Mutually assured destruction is the way I see and understand it.': 1, 'Theoretically, if 100% of miners decide to produce a certain new type of block, and there are nodes to support it, what happens to the former type of block?': 2, 'This issue really needs to be elaborated because most people dont really understand all of the aspect of bitcoins consensus - myself included\n\nIts easy to see nodes and miners as voters or delegates, but there is more to it than that.\n\nI feel like a book just about consensus vs. governance would really help smooth out all the rancor.\n\nJournalists and academics take notice': 2, 'This would not be a profitable situation for the miners. Miners are sellers of bitcoin. Not buyers. Miners would be committing economic suicide if they unilaterally pushed through a change users did not agree with.': 3, 'The way Nakamoto consensus works, it is extraordinarily unlikely that a fork will ever create two coins.\n\nIf there is actually a 50/50 split in "human consensus", then it is terribly unlikely that a blockchain fork would ever initiate, because neither side has sufficient hashpower to ensure they can defend their chain from attacks by the other side. A 75% supermajority is really the minimum majority a miner needs to believe exists before he will rationally embark on a fork.\n\n75%+ is a kind of magic number because it means that the fork with < 25% can be attacked by the majority, still leaving 51% hashpower to mine the majority fork. So no miner would rationally mine a fork with < 25% hashpower.\n\nIf a fork happens that causes 1-25% of users to leave the system, these people can change the POW algo, formalizing their minority fork into a separate altcoin that can\'t be attacked by the majority, but again, this is very unlikely, because the value of these minority-fork altcoins would be much lower than if they left the coins on the Bitcoin chain.': 2, "Depends on what HODLers and buyers do. If they don't like the new blocks, nobody will buy the new Bitcoins minted in them and miners will be forced to abandon their fork.": 1, 'You are correct, but you make the assumption that miners are well connected with the economic majority of users and nodes and therefore will make informed decisions that lead to higher coin value.\n\nSome miners may become insular, and make decisions that are detached from the economic majority. In that case, OPs concerns are valid.': 3, 'Theoretically, what if neither side budges? Would that create two cryptocurrencies?': 1, 'If the majority of the bitcoin users did not agree with the change then who would buy the coins?': 1, 'To understand the question it is useful to consider how miners, nodes, and wallets have evolved.\n\nLet\'s start by considering first generation Bitcoin. With Bitcoin as originally created, each wallet is also a node is also a miner.\n\nIt\'s easy to see how this network will not make a change that will be rejected - the miners are also the users and node operators. So machine consensus tracks human consensus closely.\n\nNow, let\'s separate these players. These days, most miners are people in a faraway country that comparatively speaking has few nodes and users.\n\nThe risk is that the *machine consensus* generated by miners can become detached from the *human consensus* of the market of nodes and users that they serve.\n\nIn theory, miners only want to make changes that users want. But since miners and users can become detached from each others care-abouts, it becomes more possible that they will introduce a change that is refused by the economic majority of nodes and users.\n\nIf the miners try to make an undesirable change through a hard fork, the system can protect against a price crash if enough nodes refuse to acknowledge the change. Nodes refusing blocks that they consider invalid is a critical protection against harmful changes being forced into the network.\n\nIf the miners make an undesirable change through a soft fork, then existing nodes cannot refuse the change. The only way for a user to refuse a change that has been soft forked onto the network is to exit (sell their Bitcoin and shut down their miner).\n\nIt is for this reason that all nontrivial or possibly contentious changes should be put to "Nakamoto vote" by requiring a hard fork instead of using a soft fork. Yes, the soft fork is more expeditious, but it carries a significant risk if miners guess wrong, because while they will have machine consensus, they will lose human consensus, possibly causing a sell off.': 2, "Sure I never said his concerns weren't valid. But even in the situation you described the miner would have to reverse course or go out of business": 1, "> By using Nakamoto consensus, bitcoin changes can be voted on by miners. If enough miners vote on a change, it's a done deal; a hard fork occurs and the new chain takes over.\n\nNo, that's not how it works.": 1, "You make the assumption that such a course is reversible.\n\nBitcoin's main advantage at this point over other crypto is its network effect / market cap due to first mover advantage. If the holders leave, it's lost even that.\n\nNot being pessimistic, just trying to shine a bright light on the situation.": 2}, ('Best way to buy bitcoin', 0): {"Have you tried [Mycelium's app](https://mycelium.com/lt/help.html)?
