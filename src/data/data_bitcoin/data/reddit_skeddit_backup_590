You write the transaction number and the output in that transaction.  So the software can go get that transaction and its output and derive the "from address" from that information.

No public key needed, no signature required.  As long as the script validates, you can use that input as money that you can spend.\n\nAnd the "to address" you eagerly check is a hash of a public key.

The "to" address is simply the last half of a script that runs, which if when run returns "true" allows you to spend the money.\n\nIn normal "address" transactions that script is "duplicate the last thing, hash it, check that the hash matches this hash I\'ve given [aka the address], and if it does, go verify that the thing you hashed was a public key and that there\'s a valid signature with it."\n\nAnd when you spend it, you provide the tx ID and vout, which provides the last half of the script, and you give it a signature and pubkey for the first part, so the full script that runs is:  "Here\'s a signature, and here\'s a public key. Duplicate the last thing [the public key], hash it, check that the hash matches this hash I\'ve given [aka the address], and if it does, go verify that the thing you hashed was a public key and that there\'s a valid signature with it."\n\nAnd when that script is run, if the signature is valid for the given public key, and if the given public key hashes to the hash given in that first tx, then the script returns "Success!"

Investors all over the world have actually *given* money to sovereign entities for the privilege of buying 3.6 trillion USD in debt.\n\nWhy has this happened and why would anybody pay interest to a borrower for the privilege of having their money borrowed, you ask? Two reasons: (1) various central banks, including the European Central Bank, Swiss National Bank and Danish National Bank have already lowered deposit rates to negative territory out of desperation, effectively pushing interest on related sovereign debts below zero; and (2) investors expect that they will be able to beat inflation *even at negative interest rates*. That\'s right, by continuing to buy these bonds the market has effectively signaled that it expects inflation to be more negative than already negative interest rates.\n\nThis is especially interesting because the financial media is chock full of central bankers reassuring investors that deflation will not happen because "we are more powerful than the market" and "the economy is fine." Meanwhile [the labor participation rate in the US is at a 36 year low](http://www.zerohedge.com/sites/default/files/images/user5/imageroot/2014/09/participation%20rate%20sept%202014_0.jpg), crude is down 60% and the middle class\' standard of living continues to deteriorate while the bond market and interest rates are signalling deflation more strongly day by day. Who should we believe? Personally, I\'d trust the market (broken as it is due to central bank intervention) far more than the bankers. If you had believed the SNB\'s talk about maintaining the CHFEUR peg and invested accordingly just two weeks ago you would have gotten obliterated.\n\nIf the market is right and deflation continues to set in get ready for central banks to continue on their path going full retard with increasingly negative interest rates until eventually average Joe\'s money market or savings account starts charging negative interest, at which point people with cash assets will just start stuffing paper notes under their mattresses rather than pay banks to hold their money. It is not hard to imagine that just as or right before we get to this point the Keynesian brain-trust of Krugman, et. al. will start demonizing rational people hoarding cash and will call for physical cash to be phased out in favor of electronic cash which ~~can be skimmed by the bankers with negative interest rates~~ can be "more easily tweaked to stimulate the economy" (personally I don\'t think this would be feasible, but it will still be proposed, just watch).\n\nThis all assumes, of course, that the whole financial house of cards stays up long enough for negative interest rates to exist over the long term.
