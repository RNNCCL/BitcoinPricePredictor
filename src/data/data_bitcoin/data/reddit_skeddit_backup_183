So you are effectively saying that previous to now your comment was not controversial and not on top when sorted by controversial, and that the controversial sort order itself influenced the voting on your comment to change the comment ordering, placing you on top. Is that correct?\n\nSince I don't have a time machine and didn't save the page a month ago I can't verify whether the controversial sort ordering is responsible for a change in the overall sentiment of your votes - but I do know that the most infamous example of this controversial sort reordering behavior was in [the thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3rejl9/coinbase_ceo_brian_armstrong_bip_101_is_the_best/) in which theymos was heavily downvoted for his exchange with Brian Armstrong and it most certainly did not change voter sentiment. It provoked several new posts upset with theymos for changing the sort order. Voter sentiment is being expressed every day in this subreddit and in every way possible and it's universally negative. It takes some serious mental jumping through hoops to think that changing the sort order on comments is going to affect public sentiment in a positive way when you are surrounded by people doing everything they can to indicate to you that it does not.

Is that correct?\n\nNo, I am saying that because /r/bitcoin, as demonstrated by this thread, has many people that evaluate content by score, rather than factuality, sorting by controversial and removing vote count forces people to think about factuality. This takes away one of the strongest weapons those who oppose reason have, decreasing credibility and censoring through downvotes\n\n>It takes some serious mental jumping through hoops to think that changing the sort order on comments is going to affect public sentiment in a positive way \n\nIf you\'re talking about the members of the "public" that are brigading and benefit from the default sort order being "best", then yes, this is absolutely negative for them.

I have spoken to the moderators, they aren\'t interested in babysitting the children that have gone there.\n\n>There are certainly other instances of other communities moderation teams alienating their own user base and new communities forming and that\'s never been brigading.\n\nNo one is claiming that formation of new communities is a form of brigading.
