Bitcoin is strictly equivalent at an algorithmic level to consecutive rounds of voting where PoW power is replaced by a weighting of votes in the same ratios, and voters incur a financial risk proportional to their weightings which they realise if consensus fails.  The reason PoW works better for pseudonymous online networks is that it gets rid of the difficult problem of deciding who gets which votes and vote weightings when you don\'t know who anyone is and have no other way to enforce risk realisation.  Bankchains make plenty of sense when you think about it this way--by simply knowing who each other are and signing legal agreements, the banks can very cheaply force a massive downside risk to consensus failure, creating the exact same incentivisation structure but with lower costs for participants when consensus is succeeding.  There\'s not that much difference between hacking a bank and hacking a mining pool--**both** rely on some method of "secrets" to control access to the voting power.  You think large mining operations don\'t ultimately rely on passwords to decide which chain they\'re mining on?  Proof of work isn\'t magic--just a mathematically easy way to measure resource commitment in open, pseudonymous networks.  If the proof of stake nut gets cracked, it will be by finding another way to do the exact same thing--enforce appropriate risk realisation in the event of consensus failure, while weighting vote power by the level of resources risked against success.  Its main promise is the same thing that bankchains are after--cheaper resource expenditure in the average case where consensus is working successfully.': 6, "Thanks for your answer.\n\nYour idea of expiring keys is interesting, and I cannot see any reason why it wouldn't work.
