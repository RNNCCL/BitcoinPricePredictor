I\'ve heard a few other respected Bitcoin community members put it this way: it\'s not that Bitcoin is automatically anonymous; it\'s that, with the right tools and preparation, it *can* be.\n\nFor the sake of argument, imagine The Government has identified your public address as belonging to you, but you would like to send some bitcoin to your friend Jim without The Government knowing who you sent it to.\n\nWhat you\'d use is a mixer. A mixer is a person or computer program who will accept a transaction, along with an encrypted final address you want the money to go to. You send the transaction to the mixer, along with Jim\'s address encrypted so that only the mixer can access that information. A few other people use the mixer in a similar way. The mixer then sends the transactions on their way--in this case, your money ends up going to Jim.\n\nThe key is that no one except the mixer and you can ever find out that "your" money went *to Jim*. Yes, outside observers can see that you sent it to the mixer, and that later the mixer sent bitcoin to Jim. But no one can prove that the money that went to Jim actually came from you, because the transaction of you -> mixer is one of many the mixer received, and the transaction of mixer -> Jim is one of many the mixer sent. As long as the mixer has enough traffic, avoids sending exactly the same amount it received, and is careful in a few other ways, nothing can be proven. Plausible deniability is maintained.\n\nOf course, this depends on the mixer not sharing its information. But if you\'re worried about this, you can create, say, 10 extra anonymous addresses, mix your transaction 10 different times, and use 10 different mixers. Then, all 10 mixers would have to share information to know that you sent bitcoin to Jim.': 3, 'Valid point and I mostly agree with you, but merchant adoption is also very important as it lends credibility to bitcoin as an investment.

I know you want to keep it simple, but you shouldn\'t be misleading. First of all, inputs or outputs are not addresses. You can (and very often do) have two different inputs coming from the same address. Any input you use is just an output from an earlier transaction someone sent you. So if Alice sent you 1 BTC, and Bob sent you 2 BTC, both to the same address, you\'d have two corresponding inputs to use for your own transactions. \n\nI\'d say a more fitting description of what an input is, is that it\'s *a signed link to a previous output.* You show to the network what output you are trying to spend, then give a signature (by using your private key) that proves that you are actually allowed to spend it.\n\nThe other important thing to understand is that inputs always have to be spent in full. Every input you take has to be completely turned into an output - every amount of bitcoin that didn\'t turn into an output is considered by the network to be your fee to miners.\n\nThat means you can\'t take a 2 BTC input from your wallet, leave 1 BTC where it is and just take 1 for your transaction. You have to take the full amount. And if you want to keep 1, you\'ll have to have an output with 1 BTC to an address you control (can be the same address where it is coming from). So a transaction would look like this:\n\n                   ------ output(1BTC) to whoever you\'re paying\n                 /\n    input(2BTC)-\n                 \\\n                   ------ output(0.9995BTC) back to yourself ("change")\n\n                   ------ miner\'s fee(0.0005BTC): this is not actually contained in any output, \n                                                  it\'s just what you didn\'t spend of the input\n\nEveryone interested how it works on a technical level should take a look at the [examples in the bitcoin wiki.](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Transaction#Principle_example_of_a_Bitcoin_transaction_with_1_input_and_1_output_only)': 3, 'doubt that there\'s "bitcoin" in the dictionary lol': 1, 'haha': -3, 'LOL.': -3, 'Yeah it is actually.
