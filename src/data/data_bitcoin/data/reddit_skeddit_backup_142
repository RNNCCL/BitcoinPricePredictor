Satoshi doesn't set anything,  the market determines value *based on demand for Bitcoin*.\n\nSatoshi **has** clearly indicated what he thinks btc is worth in fiat terms - he has never melted btc for a single dollar. Meaning Satoshi has not yet found an exchange rate to be even remotely acceptable - despite having a million btc even $1100 / btc wasn't a good enough offer to get him to part with a single bitcoin. It may be that no amount of fiat will ever be good enough for Satoshi to exchange btc for it.\n\nSo you see it is only *despite* Satoshi's total unwillingness to accept fiat scrip in exchange for bitcoin under his/her/their control that the market continues to find an exchange rate.\n\nThis is because other, lesser minds like mine are often perfectly willing to settle for 2-3x the value in fiat scrip that we originally paid for our coins.": 1, "> Bitcoin started at zero value, while fiat currency's always start at more then zero\n\nIt's an unfair comparison because national fiat scrip is what we call a *premine scamcoin*, while Bitcoin is legitimate - meaning no deception.": 0, "You're confusing how value originates from the price it starts at.  Consider Ether (Ethereum's crypto.)  It launched at a particular non-zero exchange rate.  This is common for many goods by the way.  Consider a newly discovered mineral in the ground.  The very first transaction that occurs to set the price of that mineral might be at $1 or $100 / oz.  It doesn't have to be at zero.  \n\nSo my reference to Satoshi was that he could have given bitcoin an initial value by doing the same thing as Etherium's and providing an initial peg (that he would be willing to exchange it at) vs fiat or gold.  If Satoshi announced on day 1 that he would personally buy bitcoins from anyone for 10,000 BTC per dollar, then BTC would have had an initial non-zero value.  Or, he could have structured mining such that miners would have to pay fiat or pay gold or something to generate bitcoins, which would similarly define a non-zero value for them.\n\nTo be clear - your statement that value requires two people willing to trade is correct, it's just irrelevant to this case, since many (in fact nearly all goods and many cryptocurrencies) are launched such that the first valuation is non-zero.

Nothing like this has ever happened before,  and the fact that this network existed - functionally - for a time while being worth nothing in exchange terms is critical to understanding how and why there is no upper limit to how much wealth Bitcoin can (will) absorb. \n\nYou see, Bitcoin doesn't create wealth the way fiat does. Bitcoin *can't* create wealth,  **it can only absorb existing wealth already in the economy.** That's precisely how it went from 0$ to 6bil $, and that's how it will get from 6 billion to All the Rest. \n\nIn the ancient world they had no concept of zero.

Therefore Bitcoin\'s value growth is infinite, contrasted against a large finite value growth of fiat."\n\nThe distinction between starting at zero and starting at a very small value **is the entire foundation of the argument**, if not the argument itself. \n\nI have corrected this misconception, and proved the original argument erroneous. \n\nHopefully you get it now.': 2, 'Bitcoin started at zero value, while fiat currency\'s always start at more then zero.

The rate at which the first person(s) accepted bitcoin in exchange for fiat is established at the moment the first bitcoin transaction is completed.\n\nSatoshi didn\'t point to the blockchain one day and proclaim, "this is worth ten dollars now".

That was one of the several ways I said that Satoshi **could** have initiated bitcoin with a non-zero value.  \n\nThe price of anything is not determined by where the most reluctant seller will sell, but rather where the *most motivated* seller will sell.  It doesn't matter if Satoshi values his bitcoin at $5,000 each.

Using bitcoin to make online payments or pay to another person is still sometimes inconvenient.\n\nBitcoin still fluctuates a lot, which makes non-tech savvy and uninterested people uncomfortable, and that\'s good. That gives us more time and incentive on making the platform and infrastructure better.\n\nWhen people talk about bitcoin, they often unfairly compare it to a government backed 100+ years old currency such as the USD, that has had years and years to stabilize and also has one of the (few) benefits of centralization, that it can easily adapt and change. People look at bitcoin on what it is today, they don\'t look on what it can be and provide for the world in the future. This mostly comes from lack of information and often misinformation. I want people understand bitcoin and think about what it *might* provide for the world in the future.

This really isn\'t rocket science.\n\n"No. Any amount of Bitcoin is worth \xe2\x88\x9e national fiat scrip. "  Lol, okay now I know you skipped probability 101 and economics 101 and political science 101.  \n\nIn economics, the fair value of an asset is one of two things depending on context.  It\'s A. current exchange value to a basket of goods (like clothing, rent, food, cars etc).  Or B. The present value of future cash flows.  Bitcoin produces no cash flows.  It has zero intrinsic value in an economic sense.  The "value" of bitcoin for its utility via transactions can be provided by a dozen other technologies, or even by the identical technology but via a different cryptocurrency.  This is why Warren Buffett compares bitcoin to the transaction technology underlying Visa, which can be replaced and rendered worthless at any time.\n\nSecond, you have to probability weight scenarios to come up with a fair value.  Bitcoin has a high chance of total failure, even if the idea itself is successful.  The NSA/Russia/Chinese government could easily destroy bitcoin whenever they want in a bunch of different ways.  They could spend $4 billion on ASICS and control the hashing power and another $100m on full nodes and control forks and block propagation.  For about $4.1 billion, anyone ultrarich person in the world can take control of bitcoin whenever they want.  But...they wouldn\'t even have to spend that much money.  A campaign of disinformation, bribing/coercing a couple bitcoin leaders, miners, and full node operators, and they\'d have control of the network and could destroy it if they wanted.  \n\nBut you don\'t even need bitcoin to be destroyed.  Like many great new technologies/companies, it\'s likely to be replaced by something similar but better.  Think Facebook replacing myspace and friendster.  Bitcoin\'s technology has already been replicated by many altcoins, and it\'s economic moat is mediocre.  Most of the venture capital investment, mining infrastructure, and consumer software could be switched over from bitcoin to an altcoin almost overnight.  The reason it hasn\'t is because a marginally better altcoin won\'t replace bitcoin.  It would take something substantially better, which is likely to come along at some point.\n\nLastly, fiat will always have value as long as governments exist.  As government is defined as the entity with the legal monopoly on the legitimate use of force.  It\'s that use of force that enables governments to tax.  Taxes must be paid by fiat.  So even if you have a million bitcoins, you\'re going to jail unless you also have some fiat to pay your taxes.  For that reason, fiat will always have value.\n\nPersonally, I\'m invested in bitcoin.  I think bitcoin has about a 1/3 chance of being a major success in 10 years, (worth $3000+), a 1/3 chance of being destroyed/replaced, and a 1/3 chance of remaining the dominant crypto but not growing much (probably worth $50-$1000).  When you probability-weight these outcomes, it still looks attractive.': 1, "This is disingenuous.  Other currencies don't start with zero value.

You can access your Trezor via the Chrome extension and use the xpub to start a multisig wallet. Then you can use your smart phone for the other half. If you have an old phone or another computer, you could use one (or both) as a 3rd key (or 4th) for backup. Multisig is badass!

Close though.\n\nSomething else to keep in mind with these wallets is privacy. Electrum is an SPV client which pulls your address balances from Electrum servers. You can run your own Electrum Server, but it's a lot of work. Copay queries your addresses from BitPay servers by default, but you can run your own too (with some work).
