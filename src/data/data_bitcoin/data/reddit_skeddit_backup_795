Apparently that\'s not the case and some readers try to interpret nonsense into other people\'s posts whenever possible, because then they feel superior themselves.\n\nE.g. one could think of fundamentals as the nb of bitcoin users, wallet dowloads, wallets in use, blockchain transactions per week etc. There are many such metrics. I am saying that if you take these metrics you\'ll hardly see an increase of bitcoin usage by a factor more than 10 between Jan.2013 and now, so the price rose much too fast in 2013 (caused by singular events) and it is just correcting now back to a more reasonable/fair/suitable/however-you-call-it price level.\n\nSo it\'s not surprising that in 2014 the price is continuously falling despite the continuous (slow) increase of adoption. Remember that THIS is the original topic of the thread (whether this is surprising or explainable), not what is the fair price value in absolute terms.\n\nTry to read the post in the right context, then you won\'t misinterpret. All I did is providing an explanation why in 2014 a continuous drop in price level despite simultaneous rise in adoption is not surprising but well explainable when considering fundamental factors, and I used example figures to make this easier to grasp and more illustrative, not because I think that 10 or 100 or whatever number as such is the "right" price in absolute terms.\n\nIf you still don\'t get it, I am sorry.

Sure it will oscillate in value..  Bitcoin's potential will be realized whatever happens to the current system.  Fiat is doomed to a fate like the Bible.  Media, morality, institutions and now money are not controllable any longer.  In some ways it is rather a marvel that a notion like a dollar can actually move people but the means to put value into a notion are monstrously egregious.  Money without a state is no mean feat.  Can humanity exceed the brutality of coercive power?  Is a voluntary money important and desirable? Do we bend to Lawsky?\n\nEvery market has a price where supply and demand find some equilibrium.\n\nThe confusing thing about money is that the price of money is money.  So we talk about its price as a ratio, interest.\n\nCentral banks only control one thing: supply of their own notes.  Zero or suppressed interest rates can only be accomplished by increasing supply.  So until supply increase ceases, interest rates are artificial.\n\nMuch of the world carries deep debt.  The US Federal debt alone is $2000 per human on the planet.  The mean asset worth of all humans is $3500.\n\nToo much of the proceeds of debt have gone into non productive assets.  Think suburban sprawl stuffed with crap from China. If interest rates had been determined by markets rather than by central planning, we can be sure that people would have borrowed only to finance enterprise with returns. \n\nWe now face a dark dilemma.  Since the crap from China holds no cash value, we must pay the debt other ways.  \n\nIf price suppression of debt continues then the overall size of the debt can grow.  Sounds nice but ultimately it leads to exacerbating accumulation of non producing assets. Suppressed rates destroy capital formation.\n\nThe West and indeed Japan and China face an interest rate reckoning.  \n\nWe must go through a deep recession.  This is a result of having non productive assets.  Allowing markets to determine interest will lead to sharp increase in rates as risk must be compensated for.  Non productive assets are 100% risk so rates must go higher than some long term stasis. It would/will be brutal.  \n\nThe alternative of suppressing rates is worse.  It makes the ultimate recession worse.  And make no mistake, expansion of money supply endlessly will lead to a hyperinflationary depression.  So a brutal recession either way while we build productive capital to overcome the prevailing conditions. \n\nThe Fed is in a unique position as it it controls supply of the world's currency of commerce and reserve.

The Yuan and Ruble are managed independently but they have to play along.  \n\nMost people including most Bitcoiners miss the really important thing about it.  Bitcoin is truthful money.  We know everything about it.  If any changes to its protocol are coming we will know.  \n\nDeceit is expensive.  The trick of any system of deceit is to get benefit while having another party pay. Pointing a gun to get someone else's resources is a good investment.  So is controlling their media inputs. So is monopoly supply of money.

What is Bitcoin \n\nI made this earlier, for my nephew who wanted to know. \n\n*Bitcoin: Explained avoiding technical terms.*\n\nSo Bitcoin is a network of computers. Running software that has certain rules. Rules like "This much" etc.\nAll Bitcoin computers have a big file of transactions. It\'s like a big book with millions of rows. Every 10 minutes there is a new row added to the big book. It has to start with a certain number, and this takes a lot of thinking by the computers to make.\n\nThis big book is the blockchain. The computers are mining.\nSo each 10 minutes there is a new block. It contains all transactions - like John paying Jill for a Pizza - of that 10 minutes.\n\nAll the miners are like really boring office workers, checking if the first to solve the puzzle is actually legit.\nIf anyone tries to raise his finger and call out a false puzzle, they are ignored. This process secures the blockchain from double spending coins you do not have or you already used.\n\nOnce a miner solves a block they get 25 bitcoins - out of thin air * for being such a nice lad and helping the network yet another 10 minutes.\nIf too much computers join the numbers get bigger and bigger - this is to limit the amount of coins according to the rules of the protocol.\n\nWhy is it worth something? Because it\'s an open, honest system of tokens that cannot be faked. Once you hold bitcoins, you know how the rules are.\n\nOne of the rules is:\n\n*There will never be more than 21 million bitcoins*\n\n---------------- \n\n>and how do I get some?\n\nBuy at Coinbase or any other exchange.

Instead of receiving a physical object, you instead possess a secret that enables you to transfer some or all of your balance to someone else.\n\nThe easiest way to get some Bitcoin (aside from people giving it to you via changetip) is to buy some with cash. You may either buy some from someone who is selling it in person or (if you\'re in the US) buy some via coinbase or circle.\n\nBe prepared to spend a couple thousand dollars if you want to help create some more Bitcoin. For that money, it appears you can expect to receive about $40 a month worth of Bitcoin -- and decreasing -- if you\'re lucky.\n\n-=-=-=-=-= GROWN UP TALK BELOW =-=-=-=-=-\n\nFinally, no matter how you obtain it, make absolutely sure that you write down how much you receive or purchase each time, the date, and how much it was worth the moment you received it. You will need that information at tax time. If you spend any Bitcoin and the value of the amount you spent has increased by more than 50 cents during the time you held it, you will need to report it and pay the feds a slice of that increase.\n\nFor instance, say you buy $100 worth and in six months it becomes worth $110. You spend $25 worth. It only cost you $22.75 to buy it. You made $2.25 in six months just by holding onto it. Because you held it less than a year, you will owe an additional 94 cents on your taxes in April.

Furthermore, 2 hypotheses support the argument that this evaporation in value is likely to continue.\n\nFirst: the "increasing acceptance argument". As more and more businesses, consumers and regulators come to understand the genious behind bitcoin as a technology and its great advantages as a distributed asset ledger, more and more will be adopting it. However, the increasing acceptance and adoption of bitcoin is inversely related to its price, given that almost NO BUSINESS keeps the bitcoins it receives from its customers and converts them immediately to cash. Hence, day by day, the inrease in supply of bitcoins in the market will push the price down continously with shor increases in price caused mainly by day-traders.\n\nSecond: the "BearWhales argument". There are many early adopters, most of them computers geeks who are not wealthy people or businessmen, usually computer or math guys who were experimenting with digital currencies, who out of the blue became holders of tens of thousands of coins. These people all of a sudden (during 2013 with the phenomenal increase in the price of bitcoin) became millionaires. However, since December 2013 they realised that they are millionaires only "on paper" and unless they cash the coins, their value is going to evaporte. Every now and then BearWhales will make their appearances in the market, like the one we have seen recently, who will dump their coins in thousands in order to cash in before other BearWhales make their move to dump their own coins first. Some of them will realize their coins in a gradual and unnoticeable fashion, as experienced traders do, howeverin other cases the dumping will be done "in a panic mode", in a similar way than the one we have witnessed recently, where the BearWhale, being in a panic mode, unloaded 30,000 coins at once - no experienced trader sells like that.\n\nYou may not like what you are reading because you are invested in bitcoin and you have a direct economic interest, however try to re-read this theory with a cold blood and without prejudism and you will realize that it makes a lot of sense and that the evaporation in the price of bitcoin is going to continue.\n': 4, 'This will be the fastest short-squeeze ever.

In these accounts, the Bitcoin withdrawal address belongs to TradeMore and cannot be changed by the borrower. So we act as gatekeepers to the account and any withdrawals must go through us. \n\nTwo) This is essentially correct, but our stop-loss logic is designed to pre-emptively stop any borrower going in to the red. Also, I don't think TradeMore or any of our borrowers take the idea of bankruptcy lightly. It comes with a significant reputational cost both formal (you cannot be a company director for 1 year) and informal, as well as financial (credit scores take a hit). \n\nThree) The bitcoin will typically be held in cold storage making any attempt at hacking prohibitively difficult. Because the borrower cannot simply withdraw funds they cannot use an 'I got hacked' excuse. TradeMore can see the borrower's balance and constantly monitors it. \n\nFour) This might be specific to London, but most of the traders we have met are working out of incorporated companies.

From speaking to people who have lent on BTCJam I know that there are some loans for which the borrower simply disappears and doesn\xe2\x80\x99t repay; with other loans, they are upstanding citizens and repay on time. With BTCJam, you are sending your bitcoin directly to another peer\xe2\x80\x99s bitcoin wallet. The way I see it, when you lend on BTCJam you are predominantly lending to individuals/consumers. This is not what happens when you lend with TradeMore. \n\nWhen you lend on TradeMore, your bitcoin are held by us or by bitcoin exchanges. These exchanges, such as Coinfloor, use cold storage to protect against theft. The funds are used by borrowers on the exchanges to manage their bitcoin positions.

No, because Apple Pay does not work there and my grandmother cannot choose to use Apple Pay at will.  However, my grandmother can choose to download Bitcoin, generate a wallet address, and receive bitcoins. She doesn't need anyone's permission, any more than she needs permission to reach out her hand and receive a ten dollar bill.  \n\nPeople will embrace Bitcoin, eventually, not because it's a 'mobile payment solution', but because it is uniquely useful as cash on the internet, and Apple Pay, Paypal, etc, are not and never can be because of their nature as centralized companies with limited reach who try to control how their product is used.

They're going to do the heavy lifting to get NFC terminals installed into as many retail locations as possible. With any luck, Bitcoin will be able to ride Apple's coattails for a while the major players slug it out. Let's be honest... they know about bitcoin, but they don't care, at least not yet.\n\nMillions of people becoming used to the idea of using their smart phones to pay with a simple swipe will likely assist Bitcoin in the long run. Eventually NFC terminals will be able to accept all kinds of currencies.
