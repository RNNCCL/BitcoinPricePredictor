ELI5 the KYC basics you need to execute as a company to comply.\n\n"Compliance" is about a lot more than just knowing your customer.  You have to figure out which bodies of law apply to you, which jurisdictions you\'re availing yourself to, what your requirements are under the laws of the countries and states where you have exposure (your home jurisdiction, your clients\' jurisdictions and any other jurisdiction you might have "minimum contacts" with.  Chances are you\'ll be subject to some form of financial services or consumer protection law.  What you need to comply with could be anywhere from zero regulation around your business to an explicit requirement for licensing/approval from government, self-regulatory organizations and other gatekeepers.  So, compliance and AML/KYC requirements vary as much as the law varies.\n\nKYC in the United States is meant to serve two purposes:  1.  prevent blacklisted people from benefitting from your service; 2.  facilitate the investigation of crimes.\n\n\n>2.  What are the frustrations bitcoin exchanges/companies deal besides the obvious customer dissatisfactions?\n\nThe cost of KYC is tremendous.  A proper AML/KYC program requires a staff and technology to facilitate ongoing transaction monitoring even after a user has cleared the initial verification process.  The most frustrating thing is that everyone I have ever talked to in the compliance and law enforcement industries has told me that they think it\'s ineffective.  It\'s just a ~~barrier to entry~~ cost of doing business.\n\nThe second most frustrating thing would be that there is no clear definition of requirements.  It\'s up to each business to determine what the threats are and where its weaknesses might be.  The system has to constantly evolve.  Our job is never done.  Personally, I don\'t think there\'s anything inherently suspicious about being super private, mixing your coins, etc.  My personal beliefs are often at odds with "best practices", unfortunately.  I think people ought to be fearful of the amount of information that is being collected on them.\n\n\n>3.  What would you change if you could?\n\nI understand that cutting off your enemy\'s resources is a powerful tactic in war but, as a business, I would prefer not to participate.  If you\'re running a financial service, consider yourself a conscript, and by the way, you have to build your own weapons and feed yourself on top of trying to stay alive, and if you don\'t defend the line well enough we\'ll throw you in the brig.  My preference would be to remain neutral, act in the best interest of my clients and not invade their privacy.  KYC/AML creates a huge burden for the business and a poor experience for the client, and an ongoing threat to the client in the form of a data breach.\n\nI would love not take any personal information from clients.  The custodianship of your information, like the custodianship of your bitcoin is counter party risk.  I wish we had some sort of multisig way to handle identity.  Identity, obviously, is a huge problem that someone is going to make billions solving.\n\n\n>4.  What are the repercussions of not complying well enough to KYC/AML laws.\n\nMassive fines and prison are high up on the list of reasons why Kraken operates very conservatively, and within the law.  There\'s a huge contingent liability hanging over most players in the industry who have chosen to chase a fast payday and service markets, like the United States, without the necessary licenses.  If there is ever enforcement, we might see more people going to prison and client funds locked up for years while bled away by liquidators.  Know your counter party risk.\n\n\n>5.  Where does pressure come from, the banks or the government? What kind of pressure?\n\nPressure to do AML/KYC ultimately comes from the government.  Bitcoin exchanges are financial services, and in many ways treated like banks.  Banks always ask us to see our AML/KYC program before considering opening an account--that\'s part of their own AML/KYC program.  Pressure comes in the form of audits and the ability to grant and take away licenses.\n': 7, 'Such a thorough, well thought through answer. The AMA proved unnecessary after the first post; but an ongoing discussion on these topics would be interesting to follow. I am sure there is one out there somewhere... \n\nPretty eye opening and kinda frustratingly obvious that the burden is put on the Service Providers and their interpretation of the hard rules. I respect the \'personal beliefs are often at odds with "best practices"\' line, and appreciate the transparency and diligence.\n\nWere your AML/KYC program staff and technology bought out of house, like as a service, or did Kraken hire/build one internally? \n\nIdentity is an interesting field.

I think a well designed package of 5 or so pages will really help with insight into why they should be interested and give them information to ponder after the fact perhaps a list of essential resources and graphics.  \n  \nAlso, since your a BitPay person, it would be cool to be packing a tablet, mobile device, laptop and physical storage so you can show them exactly how transactions between the bunch flow and let them try the process with your guidance for the first few times.  Definitely try showing them on their own devices so you can get the necessary software installed and BitPay accounts set up, they might just tinker around next time they come across the icon =)  \n    \nIf you do happen to encourage a business successfully, maybe focus attention to that immediate area, surrounding businesses and promoting to the general public and encouraging participation and generating interest, perhaps partnering with the businesses to get compensation for co-promotions (oh hey this is bitcoin, and guess what these guys accept it), giving you a reason to be out there, and driving them interest.      \n\nPerhaps consider contacting your local news station after a little success to see if they will do an interview in which you can give a Bitcoin speal and help educate the public on who accepts it locally.... I think people really underestimate the fact that lots of smaller news stations are always looking for new content and will cover anything if you make it sound appealing in the telephone calls & emails. \n  \nOnce you get a few merchants on board, opening the network for all of them to get involved together as somewhat of a bitcoin accepting community will help boost the general bitcoin image in your area and perhaps generate cash flow for some multi-vendor bitcoin marketing.    \nWish you the best of luck, something I would love to do as a job!

I have a hair salon in Miami so I know exactly what they are dealing with when it comes to the credit card companies.  Its a nightmare, especially if you start getting chargebacks!  When you go back next time to cut your hair tell your stylist to accept Bitcoin via Bitpay.  They have over 50,000 merchants already signed up and growing fast!  That\'s who we use.  Tell her its free for them, if the total is $20 you actually get $20.  I did notice on the costumer side they is a very small fee that is added in the bill.  For example, when I paid a $5 bill Bitpay was charging me the customer $5.05.  I would guess that\'s the spread and how they make a little money there.  But just tell her its Free b/c it is for the Merchant at least.  The funds get settle into the merchants bank account the next couple of business days!  Also, let her know they is no risk to it.  Its the same as if someone walked in a paid cash.  It takes 5 min. for the merchant to sign up with an account at Bitpay.  Bitpay verifies your ID then you add where you want your funds to settle to and that\'s it!  It\'s incredibly easy.  I have debt with SHopify, Paypal, AMEX, Visa, and many more payment companies and I can say there have hidden fees and many will suddenly hold funds or make policy changes leaving you delayed money, less money and the chargebacks are always settled in the customers favor, even if you did nothing wrong.

However, I haven't studied bandwidth growth rates closely enough to know for certain what the right rate of increase is. \n\nWhatever it is, I'm not overly concerned with a 'too-high' block size limit, as there are multiple mechanisms in place already that prevent blocks from getting too large, other than a hard limit at the protocol level. Thus far in Bitcoin's history we've seen that blocks don't get as big as the hard limit permits: the limit has been 1 MB for five years, and blocks are still only 0.5 MB. And if the hard limit turns out to be high, AND the other mechanisms fail to impose reasonable limits on the block size, a soft limit can be imposed by miners, that would be enforced as if it were a hard limit.

(Please note, if your offline computer is a 32bit system, you need to go [here](http://www.linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=178) instead)\n\n2\\. Download Universal USB Installer by clicking [this link](http://www.pendrivelinux.com/downloads/Universal-USB-Installer/Universal-USB-Installer-1.9.5.9.exe).\n\n3\\. Insert a USB stick in your computer and run the program Universal USB Installer. Select Linux Mint, the iso file you downloaded in 1. and the flash drive in each of the drop down menus.\n\nON YOUR OFFLINE (OLD) OFFLINE COMPUTER\n\n4\\. Get into the bios. If possible, disable all wifi. Set boot priority to USB before disk storage.\n\n5\\. Insert the USB stick you made in 3 and boot the machine in Linux Mint.\n\n6\\. On the desktop is a file that reads "Install Linux Mint". Double click. Choose to erase the disk and install Linux Mint. When prompted, select the "Overwrite free disk space" option. (Can\'t remember if that\'s the exact wording).\n\n7\\. Pull out the USB and reboot in Linux Mint from the Hard Drive.\n\nON YOUR ONLINE COMPUTER\n\n8\\. Insert the USB stick and format it.\n\n9\\. Download www.bitaddress.org by clicking [this link](https://github.com/pointbiz/bitaddress.org/archive/v2.9.8.zip).\n\n10\\. Extract the folder and copy it to the USB stick.\n\nON YOUR OFFLINE (OLD) OFFLINE COMPUTER\n\n11\\. Insert the USB stick and run the file *bitaddress.org.html*\n\n12\\. Move the mouse around until you see the menu tabs. Go to the *Split Wallet* tab\n\n13\\. Select the number of shares you want to distribute and the amount of keys needed to re-create the private key. I did 4 and 2 - that way I hold two shares in separate locations and gave the last two to different family members.\n\n14\\. Shrink the Firefox window so only share1 is visible. Hit Alt + Print Screen and save the screendump to the desktop.\n\n15\\. Repeat this for the other shares as well as the address.\n\n16\\. Connect the printer to the computer and install it though the Start -&gt; Printers menu (works 99% as in Windows).\n\n17\\. Print each screendump to seperate peaces of paper.\n\n18\\. Insert **a new** USB stick and copy the *bitaddress.org-master* folder and the share1 screendump to the USB stick.\n\n19\\. Do the same for the amount of shares you have on separate USB sticks.\n\n20\\. Laminate the shit out of each paper.\n\n21\\. Insert the USB stick you made in step 3. and boot the computer.\n\n22\\. Repeat step 6. This will format the offline computer once again removing the information of all the shares.\n\n23\\. Now you have a set of each share comtaining a paper print and an image on a USB stick. Distribute the set of shares in various locations that you can trust.\n\n24\\. Send your bitcoins to the Address the way you prefer. From an exchange, a hot wallet or something else.\n\n___\n\n**WHEN YOU NEED THE COINS AGAIN**\n\nWhen you need the funds, simply go to the "Split Wallet" tab on bitaddress.org **on your offline computer** and insert the shares in the bottom white space separated and generate the private key.
