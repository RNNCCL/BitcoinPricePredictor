(I know there are many who have said "the price doesn\'t matter" - but it *does*.) \n\nBitcoin is supposed to be *different* than the usual shenanigans of the legacy financial system - rigging trillions of dollars\' worth of FX, LIBOR and precious metals markets.\n\nThe pristine, isolated pure part of Bitcoin - the network itself - *is*, as far as we\'ve seen, transparent and honest and stable.\n\nBut Bitcoin doesn\'t exist in a vacuum. In order to be of any use, it has to be exchangeable for fiat and for goods and services - at a "fair" market price.\n\nThe interfaces between bitcoin and fiat - in particular, the exchanges, most of which are shady - many of which have disappeared - this is a big murky area which can be damaging to Bitcoin in several ways:\n\n- It keeps people away from Bitcoin, due to fear. \n\n- It makes it easy to manipulate the price.\n\nBitstamp could implode overnight. BTC-e is in Russia and nobody knows who runs it. One of the majore Chinese exchanges (I can\'t remember which - Huobi or OKCoin) apparently has no fees - thus allowing the possibility of faked trades to increase volume (ie, "self-trades"). Mt Gox is gone. And many other exchanges have also disappeared.\n\nMany parts of the ecosystem cropping up around Bitcoin are a festering cesspool of corruption, fraud and incompetence.\n\nAnd yet - we are basing our entire 2014 bitcoin price narrative on these shady actors.\n\nI don\'t think the spectre of Mt Gox is gone yet. As long as we keep believing "The price dropped from 1200 USD to 300 USD", then the rot of Mt Gox is still with us.\n\nAnd you can bet that MasterCard and JPMorgan and all of our other fiat slaveholders are quite happy with the festering cesspool of shady operators and unreliable numbers growing up around Bitcoin.\n\nWe know they have the motivation - and the means - to destroy Bitcoin.\n\nIf I were JPMorgan or MasterCard (or some govt that hated Bitcoin) - I wouldn\'t try to ban it. That would be too obvious.\n\nI\'d just set up yet another PHP-MySQL based exchange in some remote godforsaken jurisdiction -and let the trading begin! \n\nI\'d flood the market with fake fiat (heck, I could flood the market with fake btc too - after all, it\'s only PHP and MySQL while it\'s on my exchange ha-ha-ha), I\'d create volatility, rollercoasters, panics, fraud, corruption, black swans, naked short selling, pain, agony and tears - and rinse and repeat for the next ten years until every Bitcoiner is thoroughly traumatized and gives up on this majestic dream.\n\nDo we have any *proof* the powers-that-be aren\'t doing that?\n\n"Nah, they\'d never do that." (And yet - we see the CIA sending fake rappers to Cuba to try to take to down their govt. We see that the Feds tried to do to Tor recently. We saw the Snowden revelations - only 1% of which have been published yet.)\n\nLawsky\'s not our enemy.

I remember hearing it was due to some hack of Mt Gox - some kind of data dump?\n\nWe *do* know that people couldn\'t get fiat out of Mt Gox for many many months around late 2013 and early 2014. That would certainly corroborate with the data in the blog post above.\n\nI agree that it\'s important to base our perceptions and decisions on "proof" or "reality".\n\nThe thing is, pretty much everyone has been basing their perceptions and decisions on a figure of "1200 USD per Bitcoin" - based on numbers stored in an unsecure PHP/MySQL database at an exchange run by known incompetent and/or fraudulent operators - and that exchange soon went POOF! How much proof or reality should we accord to numbers coming from an exchange like that.\n\nSo the question is: Where is the proof that Bitcoin ever really was being sold, in large quantities (ie, in accordance with the volume indicated from the publicly available API), on Mt Gox in Nov-Dec 2013 for 1200 USD?\n\nI bet some lucky, clever traders *did* manage to sell BTC for 1200 USD during that rally - ie, there were real people paying real money for BTC at that time (ie, they weren\'t the "Willy Bot"), and some up of them paid up to 1200 USD.\n\nBut a lot of people also got *nothing* for selling their BTC.

Many are not.\n\nI think it\'s important for people to be aware that that blog post exists - with its allegations / theories about the Willy Bot spending 112 million USD in fake fiat, in spurts of 2,500,000 each. \n\nWas there ever any more investigation of the theories in that blog post? I never really followed it up at the time - not being in a position, personally, to verify or debunk it.\n\nI am curious if anyone has any more info on the status of that blog post. Is it totally made up? Is it based on an actual data dump? Was the data dump ever confirmed?\n\nThese seem to be important questions. As I say, they make all the difference between the following two scenarios for Bitcoin Price 2014:\n\n- crashing from 1200 USD to 300 USD\n- rising from 100 USD to 300 USD\n\nDoes anyone have any proof about what happened at Mt Gox?\n\nIf we don\'t, should we continue to let the rally of Nov-Dec 2013 affect our perceptions of bitcoin prices?\n\n': 3, 'I hear what you\'re saying. It\'s a fractal, random walk, Brownian motion, martingales, Monte Carlo method, whatever. I did try to read through some financial mathematics books (although I\'m not too fond of stochastic differential equations) - but even as a layperson, we all can understand that a market will move unprectibably based on many, mostly unknowable factors.\n\nAnd I agree this movement is healthy - because, as you said, if the price simply moved steadily "up up up" then it would suddenly be *predictable* - and everyone would pile in. So it can\'t go up (or down) in the same direction forever - it has to be unpredictable and random.\n\nNow, let\'s make a slight refinement: Let\'s postulate that the price did not go up *steadily* from 100 USD to 300 USD over the past year (ie, this would be a world where no November-December 2013 12x spike had occurred).\n\nLet\'s say that it went from 100 to 300 USD over the past year - *but taking a random walk above and below that trend-line*.\n\nThis would be quite unremarkable market behavior. It wouldn\'t be "predicable" because there could still be peaks and valleys above and below an average trend-line from 100 to 300 USD.\n\nBasically the Willy Bot theory can be useful in response to people asking "Why didn\'t the price go up after Microsoft and Time?" \n\nAccording to the Willy Bot theory, **the price from Nov/Dec 2013 to now might have been a random walk above and below a trend-line moving from 100 to 300 USD.** And when you add in the effect of an alleged Willy Bot pumping the market with USD 112 million in fake fiat in Nov/Dec to cause a very brief spike to 1200 USD - well then there of course will be massive pressure to "correct" that spike back to whatever the "real" trend-line would have been.\n\nSo it can be important for people wondering about the "falling" price of 2014 to know that *certain people* (I have no idea who) have theorized that the 12x price spike of Nov/Dec 2013 was faked.\n\nThere is no evidence that that price spike was real or fake, is there? All we know is that the exchange where it apparently started:\n\n(a) Couldn\'t pay out fiat for many months in late 2013;\n\n(b) Went bankrupt in 2014;\n\n(c) Provided conflicting stories about what was going on;\n\n(d) Never accounted for the missing fiat or bitcoins\n\nSo given the shakiness of that exchange, it might be reasonable to take the "1200 USD" figure with a major heaping of salt. This is just something which has been occurring to me over the past few months. Yes I know there is selling pressure of 3600 bitcoins being mined every day. But there could also be "correction pressure" due to an ATH of USD 1200 which was based on non-existent USD 112 million.\n\nDoes anyone know where the data dump (on which the Willy Bot was based) came from?\n\nEssentially, I\'m coming from the aspect of Plato\'s shadows in the cave. I just don\'t know what to believe for the price anymore - when the leading price indicator (Mt Gox) proved to be so hackable and eventually went bankrupt.\n\nI hope that eventually there will be some more decentralized means of buying and selling bitcoins (eg, the feature on Mycelium which lets people find local buyers/sellers). \n\nSo I think it is healthy to be skeptical of numbers that came, essentially, from Mt Gox. Not a good "single source" of truth by any means.': 1, 'Well I\'m definitely not emotionally married to believing the price was \'really\' above $1000, because I sure as hell didn\'t buy any BTC at that level, and it was only at those high levels for a short period of time.\n\nI think today pulling off that kind of heist / manipulation would be much more difficult.  In a strange way, I actually get a thrill when I see the price falling near $300 and below, because to me it\'s just "getting it out of its system".  Once the market is done puking, it can brush its teeth and begin to eat again.  I think there is definitely fundamental support for this new digital commodity, so [I\'m not worried at all.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ps5a6MzUak)': 1, "It's all good when 300$ is in fact the bottom.": 1, '>Imagine if people had instead seen the price of bitcoin simply go up slowly but surely from USD 100 to USD 300 over the last 12 or 13 months.\n\nThis is the kind of ridiculous price action people believe indicates a "healthy" market.  Real markets don\'t actually move like this, because if they did, they\'d immediately get flooded with people looking to ride the wave higher (thus creating a bubble).\n\nPrice action is recursive, it\'s self-reinforcing.  And while I don\'t know if your theory is true or not (I think it\'s possible, considering what bad security Mt Gox had), it doesn\'t really matter.  Bitcoin\'s current price action is completely within the realm of normalcy.  And if Bitcoin were currently trading for $5000, that would also be completely within the realm of normalcy.
