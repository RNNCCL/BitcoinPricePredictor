The price has swung violently over the past few years with little rhyme or reason. \n\nIt hasn\'t been a good investment for the last year, but since it was going down in price, that\'s hardly a surprise.  It doesn\'t tell us whether bitcoin is going to go up or down _from now_.  And if you were going to invest, then buying at a bottom would be a far better time to invest than at the top.  Using this journalists logic would have your buys and sells in exact anti-phase with the profitable times.

There\'s no "justify" in a market.  There\'s no justification for a $1 bitcoin, a $5 bitcoin, a $100 bitcoin or a $1000 bitcoin.  The price is the price -- none of them are any more justified than any other.  What "justifies" today\'s $215?  Why is it worth 50% more than it was a few days ago?\n\n> The surge in Bitcoin prices back then was a classic speculative mania, just like Internet stocks in the late 1990s and houses in the mid-2000s\n\nYeah, hindsight is easy.  Calls like this are only impressive at the time, not after watching the price decay back for a year and then shouting "that was a bubble".  No shit, any fool can see that now.\n\n> When people say that the price of something should keep going up indefinitely, that often means that too many people are chasing that asset higher ... and it\'s really due for a painful crash. \n\nWho said that?  "Indefinitely" might as well be "I call it infinity times, double, triple stamped, no take backs, times infinity squared".  At $1000 I would still think Bitcoin would have room to grow.  That\'s not the same as "indefinitely" though.  It didn\'t -- doesn\'t change my opinion -- "bitcoin still has room to grow".\n': 9, 'The only real problem is the interface between Bitcoin and fiat. Fiat and Bitcoin are entirely separate economic systems, where exchanges are the gatekeepers inbetween. \n\nBitcoin is by and large not a closed economic loop yet. People must be paid in BTC, spend BTC at stores, stores buy their supplies from suppliers with BTC, and pay their employees with BTC. Bitcoin is still tiny compared to companies like VISA. Most people get paid in fiat, so it makes no sense to then buy BTC and spend BTC if you can just buy what you want with fiat. No one likes extra steps. \n\nUntil we are really pricing things independently in Bitcoin instead of fiat, this is how it will be for now.\n\nThis is why I maintain while Bitcoin can be spent as currency, it is better to consider it an asset (like a stock) for now. \n\n': 1, 'Typical adoption curve for new technologies.

If you are trying to peg to an asset that grows by k percent a year, and nothing grows k percent a year in your economy, then you have to have a situation where either there is a negative interest rate to make up the difference or the whole situation is a Ponzi scheme. Bad pegging schemes are schemes that collapse into case (ii), good pegging schemes are schemes that collapse into case (i); this was the foundation of my design of schellingdollar and my criticism of seignorage shares. The three examples from https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-examples-of-when-governments-and-central-banks-failed-to-maintain-a-currency-peg all seem to be an example of this Ponzi failure mode.\n\nSo the question with a monetary policy is, does it perform currency expansion in a way that is irreversible? There are two ways to accomplish this goal. One is to make the central bank actually hold the asset it is pegging to (eg. 0.833 EUR in the CHF case); if this is done, then as long as the central bank is trusted the peg is infallible. However, we crypto people don\'t like central anything, and it\'s not possible for a DAO to hold USD or commodities directly. Central banks don\'t like this approach because it denies them flexibility (they _want_ to be able to break pegs if it suits their other objectives) and because it denies them seignorage revenue. The second approach (actually a superset of the first, but go with me for a second) is to make the currency completely debt-based, ie. all positive balances are matched by negative balances. The result would be that if the economy goes down and some parties cannot pay off their debts, whoever happened to be their creditor would lose money (collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps can be used to manage this risk). The problem comes when the set of debtors is too centralized, as then default of a single debtor breaks the whole system (or poses large systemic risk of doing so, as in the case of an oligopoly of banks all following similar policies).\n\nThe idea behind a schellingdollar scheme is to allow anyone to participate on either side of the bargain, either as a holder of stablecoin or as a debtor (using volcoin as collateral), reducing the black swan risk of having a single central bank be the primary debtor. What is particularly interesting is that any volcoin holder can participate in "backing" the currency via arbitrage: instead of holding $X worth of volcoin, hold { $2X worth of volcoin, -X stablecoin } inside the system and X of the underlying asset outside the system. This gives them nice profit opportunities in case of market crashes, as they will have risk-free (relative to their prior position as just volcoin holders) gains via negative interest rates sapping away their negative stablecoin, so the result is that the entire market is effectively hard at work at the task of finding the lowest-possible-risk form of backing for the asset. This removes the potential for seignorage revenue and the cryptoeconomic algorithm is designed not to be mutable for political reasons; this is the fundamental tradeoff that stability gets you.\n\nThe only risk left is basically a black swan hole: it works fine because the math says it works fine given continuity assumptions, but it breaks if everything breaks all at once too quickly, or if there exists no real-world asset profile that can maintain anything close to the peg with a low risk. But then just about every non-boring financial construct has that property, including derivative markets under a hypothetical fixed-supply currency :)': 1, "There is indeed nothing stopping the Swiss bank or any other from *keeping down* their currency ad infinitum, since they have an infinite supply of Swiss francs.\n\nKeeping the value *up* is an entirely different story.\n\nPegs, to the extent that they have practical meaning, basically always break.

It's not that they *couldn't* keep on selling Bitcoin at that price, it's simply that they've decided that it's no longer prudent to, that they're unnecessarily risking wealth in doing so, and that perhaps it's not in the best interests of the Bitcoin economy to do so.": 5, "These euros are on the SNB's balance sheet (some 370 freaking *billion* of them).

Do your homework before you start besmirching people\'s characters with ignorant internet comments. I did my homework when I was thinking about investing in Bitreserve. This is from a forum post from CrowdCube where Bitreserve raised almost $1mm from the crowd:\n\n>4. I am not familiar with chapter 7 proceedings (see risk factors). How may this impact Halsey\'s commitment to bitreserve going forward?\n\n>Halsey is a remarkable entrepreneur who has created billions of dollars of value for investors in his ventures, but it\'s true that he is currently working out a bankruptcy. For me (and I\'ve invested over $400k of my own money and more than a year of my life in Bitreserve) the important point to keep in mind is that Halsey has never lost anyone else\'s money. He also didn\'t lose all his money. He got divorced and his ex-wife is still extremely wealthy. Following his divorce, he got depressed and was down and out for many years, not paying as close attention to his new ventures, his investments, and the economy in general.\n\n>Then 2008 happened and every single bank in the US went bankrupt. Every single one. They did lose everyone\'s money. If not for the bail-out, they would all have gone out of business.\n\n>In 2008, Halsey had loans outstanding with many of those banks and those loans were called. His borrowing wasn\'t unreasonable considering his paper assets (he was the second biggest shareholder of Salesforce.com when it did its IPO), the ventures he had cooking, and the value of his hard assets (art, houses, etc). But in 2008 it didn\'t matter because the markets all crashed and he had to firesale everything.\n\n>If Halsey hadn\'t been depressed, he probably would have been more aware of what was coming in 2008. But he wasn\'t the only one who didn\'t see it coming--every single bank got blindsided.\n\n>This is all very personal information to share publicly and painful for Halsey to talk about, but I (and he) understand why investors want to understand what happened.\n\n>The cool thing is that if it wasn\'t for that experience, Halsey probably would never have come up with Bitreserve. Our real-time transparency is a direct result of his experience with the financial crisis. Bitreserve is showing that there is a better, safer way for financial systems to operate. Instead of being black boxes in which value-destroying risk builds up, they can be glass houses like Bitreserve. Instead of greedy obfuscation, there can be sound financial stewardship and transparency.\nHalsey\'s bankruptcy is totally irrelevant to Bitreserve\'s potential, value, and likelihood of world-changing success. \n\n>In fact, I\'d argue that Halsey\'s bankruptcy is a point in favor of Bitreserve, as this is his big comeback. I know he spends every moment of every day focused on making Bitreserve the biggest success of his incredibly successful career as an entrepreneur.\nIt took me about ten minutes talking to Halsey (I didn\'t know him before I joined Bitreserve) to see that his bankruptcy was in the rearview mirror and Bitreserve was something I wanted to help him build.\n\nedit: took out the stuff that wasn\'t relevant to Bitreserve founder.': 0, "It's nothing like paycoin...\n\nThere's no 'promised' floor or anything like that.\n\n": 1, 'Localbitcoin would be fine for that.
