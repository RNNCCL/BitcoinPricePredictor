Think of it this way: you put 1 coin into your JM wallet; you actually need to spend it. When you do, you may create a change output (usually you will of course). We can't enforce isolation of that change output from the original mixdepth it was spent from, as this would mean creating a new mixdepth/identity for each transaction, i.e. they would grow infinitely. So we make a specific promise: **that the coinjoin output is not recombined with the inputs or the change output**. Take a look at the diagram for 'canonical joinmarket transaction' [here](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/JoinMarket-Docs/blob/master/High-level-design.md#joinmarket-transaction-types). Simple arithmetic can usually figure out, just from looking at the transaction on the blockchain, which change outputs are connected to which inputs. So there's no point trying to put them on separate branches, even if the infinite regression problem I mentioned above didn't exist.\n\nSo, back to external/internal distinction: the function of the external branch is to give the user a place to get receiving addresses (for sending into the wallet), safe in the knowledge that Joinmarket itself won't erroneously also choose to use these addresses to send to. So a coinjoin output at mixdepth 1 will always be an *internal* address (note: this is for cases where a wallet pays to itself, if you are doing a coinjoin as a sender, your coinjoin output is usually going outside the wallet). This is actually something that was fixed, see [this](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket/issues/283)": 3, '/u/joinmarket-xt \'s (good name eh) summary covers good ground on this (edit: and /u/belcher_ \'s, we\'re all here:) ), but I want to add some more "circumstantial" details about the use of IRC, messaging and Sybil.\n\n1. Use of [end to end encryption](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/JoinMarket-Docs/blob/master/High-level-design.md#encrypted-messaging) means a central server (IRC or anything else) doesn\'t know the ownership of the coins, and cannot tamper/MITM the coordination process once it\'s started. Authentication to bitcoin keys owning the utxos to be used in the join is used to ensure this part.\n2. Censorship by the single IRC owner is possible; that\'s why /u/belcher_ has been working on a multiirc branch, as /u/joinmarket-xt mentioned. More generally, we do want a more scalable and less censorable messaging layer. PRs welcome!\n3. Sybil. That was the first question I had about joinmarket when /u/belcher_ started the project ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2ku4tc/darkwallet_forward_from_irc_coinjoin_proposal/clp2m4j?context=2)). It is not really an issue with IRC, since a decentralized messaging system has the same issue (central server changes the model of attack, but both are Sybil vulnerable in principle). We had long discussions (on IRC, I guess not ironically) about what we can do to defend against this without resort to persistent identities. I\'d point to [this](https://gist.github.com/AdamISZ/9cbba5e9408d23813ca8) gist, which is referenced in [this](https://github.com/Joinmarket-org/joinmarket/issues/343) vague roadmap for a 0.2 version of Joinmarket (see section 0.2.0 Upgrade the protocol).\n\nLastly, the general topic of \'what is the best messaging layer/tech\' to use has gone on forever. It\'s worth considering what properties it needs to have for our use, see the bullet point list [here](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/JoinMarket-Docs/blob/master/High-level-design.md#messaging-layer).

This is expensive in opportunity cost. All the sybils must also compete in a market with everyone else.

The way banks work today is not that every transaction done between two parties is sent directly from one bank account to the other.

Most mainstream economist believe having a limited currency supply the way Bitcoin does is a bad idea. \n\nIn fact, you have less mainstream, but very publicly visible and popular economists like Yanis Varoufakis who actually envision a global digital currency as a necessary part of the equation to solving the dead end alley the world seems headed down. But he refuses to endorse Bitcoin in large part because of the 21 million limit. This is the kind of economist the world will take very serious in the face of a global economic collapse.\n\nThe 21 million cap is so controversial among non-bitcoin investors that many alt-coins -- dogecoin comes to mind for example -- have rejected this model entirely. This shows that having the cap is an arbitrary aspect of the protocol that many people will disagree with. As the community grows, the proportion of people who are early adopters and for whom the cap benefits will shrink in proportion to the number of users for whom the advantages of the cap seem less apparent. \n\nAll that is required is a situation where there isn\'t enough liquidity in the ecosystem and you have a debate very similar to the block size debate, where many will argue that the system will collapse unless the base currency supply is enlarged. These people will muster support through populist appeal, backed by banking and credit provider interest groups for whom an inflating currency is vital. They will point to the fact that "greedy hodlers" are willing to let the economy contract just so they can make more money for themselves, and since political capture would be possible -- in the future scenario where hard forks are a regular thing -- a reversal of the protocol would be all but inevitable. \n\nAnother possible scenario would be one in which the network fees that sustain the system may make Bitcoin uncompetitive with another network, forcing investors to fear that unless we come up with another way of paying miners the value of the network as a whole could suffer. It might be argued, and eventually accepted by the majority, that an ever expanding currency base to pay the miners will ultimately be more beneficial to investors than a fixed currency supply with shrinking network use because of high fees.  \n\nBut more importantly than the how or why an increase to the 21 million cap might occur, is that the uncertainty that the cap will always remain -- because of the realization that the protocol is fickle and always changing and that the 21 million cap is actually up for debate -- will preemptively remove the value, from an investment perspective, in having the cap in the first place. \n\nThat is to say, if the cap is a cap that can always be theoretically removed with little difficulty, then it really isn\'t a cap at all. It would be like the "debt ceiling" used by the US government. At regular intervals the government has to vote to raise the limit further, and they always do, making the whole purpose of even having a "limit" simply symbolic, it plays no actual economic role. Likewise, a 21 million cap that is always voted on in Bitcoin with varying results is not a meaningful cap economically because it is not reliable and will be perceived to be arbitrary and subject to change, this will be priced in even before the cap is actually removed.  \n': 8, 'And if people vote to increase the rewards, then you can vote against by forking the project and maintaining the current block reward.

Tight security comes from encrypting data in each block, as well as requiring all the other computers, or nodes, on a given blockchain to verify transactions. \xe2\x80\x9cThis market is at the concept stage,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jeremy Millar, a partner with Magister Advisors, an M&A advisory firm. \xe2\x80\x9cThese are long-run plays. But a really important long-run play.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFinancial services firms have jumped in, building pilot systems to process banking, trading and other asset transactions. CIOs in all industries should be investigating blockchain because of its potential to increase efficiency in conducting transactions with outside parties and speed up how quickly transactions are completed, said Chris Perretta, global head of enterprise data and technology at State Street Corp.\n\nState Street is starting to experiment with blockchain in three ways: internally as part of core software development; with clients in private trials; and as part of a handful of consortia of the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest banks and technology companies. \xe2\x80\x9cNo one doubts the usefulness of blockchain because it\xe2\x80\x99s working now in the Bitcoin world,\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Perretta said, referring to the virtual currency that is based on blockchain technology. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not like the technology has to become; it\xe2\x80\x99s there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThe first step is to assess your organization\xe2\x80\x99s tolerance for risk, Mr. Millar said.

Coders can use a variety of languages. Some are familiar, like C and JavaScript, said Hu Liang, senior managing director, head of the emerging technologies center at State Street. Others are new, such as Serpent, from the non-profit Ethereum Frontier, which offers a blockchain development platform\n\nOther key steps CIOs can take to delve into blockchain include the following:\n\nWhen deciding what kind of application to pilot, find a relatively simple transaction your company frequently performs, and try to recreate it with (?) blockchain tools from different vendors, Mr. Millar said. That will show any differences in how technology companies handle blockchain, he said.\nBring in several vendors, both startups and established players such as Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., to build test applications, Mr. Millar advised. Without industry standards, each vendor has its own approach to blockchain. Bring in several companies for discussions and pilots to learn about their biases, he said.\nOne of blockchain\xe2\x80\x99s strengths is efficiency. After you are familiar with how blockchain works, look for a new scenario to try. Identify a business process that requires many hand-offs to complete, such as a complicated purchase order or financial transaction.

Will coins be confiscated and awarded to others?

I don\'t believe that Core has the power to make changes prohibited by the rules of the system while they are opposed by an economically significant portion of Bitcoin\'s users. If it does, by way of inertia or lazyness, have that power I don\'t believe it has the moral authority: to rewrite the system out from under people risks walking the thin line of theft.

Satoshi\'s opinions are not always consistent with each other, but if you consider when things were said compared to events of the time (The slashdotting, advent of pooled mining, separation of node power from mining power, overflow bug, removal of the "market" code, etc.) you\'ll see his opinion on "microtransactions" and "miner majority" change.

If the rules need to change, mining majority is the ultimate consensus mechanism and is only restrained by economic laws and the economic majority\'s willingness to follow the mining majority.

While some money (gold, copper) has "intrinsic value", that value is often much lower than the value of that quantity of material used as money and it often interferes with the money function, or the money function interferes with its applicability to other uses.  In other words, people don\'t gold-plate many electronics because doing so is literally painting it with money.  Therefore, the perfect money is simply and fundamentally a distributed memory.

Rather than innovating with big ideas, they innovate via skill.
