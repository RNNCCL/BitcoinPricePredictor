An option is an option, regardless of your narrow definition of 'spending Bitcoin'.\n\n> This is a cash grab for Coinbase, Shift and VISA.\n\nCoinbase is a business on top of Bitcoin offering a service so yes, they are trying to support a service that uses its service to create a novel workaround for Bitcoin usage in the real world.

Gold does have use in [electronics and other things](http://geology.com/minerals/gold/uses-of-gold.shtml).': 2, 'I have been Shreddited for privacy!': 3, '**TLDR**: BTC can go to the moon, or it can become a derailed project.  I think that unless we keep up adopting new users and merchants and give them a good Bitcoin experience (which certainly involves "transactions going through" and "wow, I just paid for my coffee with bitcoins instead of visa"), Bitcoin _will_ become a "fringe thing" in some few years, mostly outcompeted by new and improved centralized banking solutions, and/or a jungle of altcoins, and/or the whole "decentralized cryptocurrency"-thing may end up being regulated into the underground markets.  The BTC value _will_ drop due to this.  To keep up the adoption rate we\'ll definitively need a higher effective blocksize pretty soon.  I\'m concerned that the segregated witness is too late, too little and involving too much complexity, but I hope to be proven wrong.\n\nLet me elaborate on what I mean with "derailment".\n\nBitcoin so far is a success in several ways;\n\n1) Today, bitcoin is the de-facto standard for crypto-currencies - there is a jungle of alt-coins out there, but as for vehicles for transferring value they are still just marginal alt-coins. If the Bitcoin project will "derail" too much, then I\'m concerned that we\'ll be stuck with a "jungle of cryptocurrency coins", bitcoin just being one out of many - and people won\'t bother to try to chose their favorite coin, they will chose whatever solutions their bank will provide.\n\n2) Bitcoins have grown immensely in value, and will keep growing as more people join in as holders and users. Most people in the bitcoin environment are bitcoin holders and thus have direct interest in this. The trend may reverse if people give up on bitcoin. Regulations may never kill bitcoin, but it may cause bitcoins to become a very marginal thing with a low value.\n\n3) Although most people know very little about "bitcoins", I believe a majority of the "digitally literate" population have at least heard the word by now. That may also reverse as people forget the word again.\n\nCompare that with ...\n\n1) Chat services. There used to be IRC, but the derailment started already in 1990 due to a protocol design flaw (any node in the network has super-admin-rights), and then the one and only IRC network eventually became split into many networks mostly due to arguing and disagreements. Today IRC is still alive, but hardly used by "ordinary people", and the "chat scene" is a real jungle out there with several IRC networks plus lots and lots of different proprietary networks. While there do exist some few open standards for chat networks, none of them have any significant adoption. Try to organize a chat meeting for a non-tech organization (and even in quite some tech organizations) and one will have a real hard time to find a chat service that is "acceptable" to all participants. The scalability issue may be as problematic for bitcoins as the "superadmin"-problem in IRC, and the heated blocksize arguments may prove to be toxic.\n\n2) PGP. One can certainly argue that PGP has many problems, but "adoption" is certainly the biggest problem. It\'s 2016, and ordinary folks still have no clue how to sign or encrypt emails! SSL is the most widespread encryption, and until letsencrypt.org came we\'ve been totally dependent to pay money to the "PKI mafia" for certificates, and ... trust them to do it right.\n\n3) "Social media". There are some few big commercial actors that really have succeeded in building their proprietary ecosystems. People who want to stay socially connected have to become customers, not only of one, but of all those. I\'ve heard wedding parties and such has been organized with the invitation on Facebook only. I\'m not at Facebook, I\'ve probably lost out on a lot of fun.\n\nI\'d say IRC and PGP are perfect examples of derailed projects. One can certainly claim they have failed for technical reasons, but the very biggest problem is lack of adoption.  Some may even claim that they aren\'t failed at all.  While I do use IRC and PGP on a daily basis, I\'d still say it\'s "derailed projects" - they never lived up to their full potential and they never will.\n\nAs for the "social media" situation, that can be compared to the banks scrambling to invent "mobile payment". At least here in Norway we now have three banks competing to get any adoption for their proprietary closed solution. One of the features is that one can pay to a friend, the receiver will of course need to install the same app to be able to receive the money. With insufficient bitcoin adoption, bitcoin will continue being a "fringe" thing, while ordinary people will be using closed, platform-dependent and proprietary banking apps.\n': 1, "bitcoin is far less expensive and easier to transfer than gold, always will be.

It was a little hobby of his, but he wasn\'t famous or a major participant. One day the idea for Bitcoin came to him. He wasn\'t sure that it\'d work, but he was excited about it, so he thought that he\'d give implementing it a try. In the two years that it took him to finish 0.1, new interesting facets of the problem presented themselves, and he was able to solve them. He considered a number of future use-cases, and added support for them to his software. When it all seemed to be working OK, he released it.\n\nYou have to understand that the ideas behind Bitcoin are not way out there. All of the crypto already existed, and even the idea of a block chain already largely existed in the form of git. Satoshi didn\'t need to be a mathematician, cryptographer, or master software engineer to come up with the ideas behind Bitcoin and then implement them. In fact, I think that Satoshi might not have been much of a programmer before building Bitcoin. But he was dedicated and detail-oriented. Maybe he read a good C++ book front-to-back before starting on the coding, and then put real effort into following best practices (with a large amount of success, though some imperfection).\n\nIn 2009 Satoshi was probably disappointed that Bitcoin wasn\'t getting much attention. But when things started picking up in 2010, he enjoyed explaining Bitcoin to people. He liked talking about the technology that he\'d spent so much time thinking about and coding.\n\nBut then various more difficult problems arose. He didn\'t have a solid idea for long-term scalablity. He\'d always planned to implement SPV in his client, but doing so looked like it\'d take some major hacking. He\'d had vague plans of auctions & trading systems built into the client, but he couldn\'t find a good design for these things. Etc. Additionally, he was having to deal more and more with people, which he didn\'t much enjoy. Some people started to question his technical decisions, making it more difficult for him to make changes, and he couldn\'t always depend on miners running his code. There was also wikileaks and Gavin\'s CIA visit. All in all, Satoshi probably felt like he was losing track of the project, and moreover he didn\'t see anything technology-wise that he particularly wanted to work on; the programming that needed to be done was huge and/or conceptually very difficult (including some things which haven\'t been settled even today). So he just gradually lost interest. Most people forget that he didn\'t just completely vanish one day; first he left the forum and only responded via email, then he only responded to a handful of his usual correspondents via email, and finally he stopped responding to even these people.\n\nAfter his last forum post were he said he was "venturing into more complex ideas", I think that this was not some hint that he was quitting Bitcoin and doing something else. I think that sometime after this post he actually did do a lot of work on solving some big technical problem, but failed to really solve it.

There are often times where Western Union is cheaper when all is said and done.\n\nIt's a solvable problem, but it would take a a committed effort by an organization that would have to (probably) forego immediate profits for long term market building. An organization that was committed to helping to build global liquidity would benefit everyone in the long run. There's already lots of boots on the ground in some of these parts of the world, but everyone has had to deal with the liquidity road block thus far.

Although IMO liquidity is not such a big problem.    \n": 1, "The only path to adequate liquidity is higher prices.
