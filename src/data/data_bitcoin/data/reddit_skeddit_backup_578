The lone requirement of the course is to propose a venture that is related somehow to the bitcoin blockchain.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhile sceptics may doubt there could be Facebook-style riches at stake, particularly since the price of a bitcoin collapsed last year, the claims being made for the technology\xe2\x80\x99s revolutionary potential are only getting grander.\nThis is why Prof Harvey, a professor of finance, and other US academics have created courses that offer the study of the virtual currency, including the legal and economic issues that it raises and, most importantly, the technology that underlies it.\nIn depth\n\nBitcoin\nBitcoin\nAs interest in Bitcoin increases, US officials are looking into how to regulate, rather than shut down, the virtual currency\n\nFurther reading\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are staking out some academic territory and trying to get the university\xe2\x80\x99s brand associated with a new body of knowledge,\xe2\x80\x9d says David Yermack, the finance professor at New York University\xe2\x80\x99s Stern Business School, whose MBA course, created with law school colleague Geoff Miller, finished before Christmas. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is an entrepreneurial venture for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBitcoin was created in the wake of the financial crisis by an anonymous computer scientist keen to displace central banks, government currencies and the traditional banking system. But while the currency he created attracted high-minded libertarians and people of lower motives, such as drug dealers and money launderers, it is the technology that allows the ownership of a bitcoin to be transferred from one user to another which is generating enthusiasm among venture capital investors.\nKnown as the blockchain, this transfer mechanism could be expanded to move almost any financial asset, with potential applications for writing wills, selling houses or agreeing derivatives contracts.\n\xe2\x80\x9cMost financial contracts can be put in the blockchain,\xe2\x80\x9d Prof Harvey says.\nSome visionaries go even further. Because the blockchain is based on unique keys that validate a user\xe2\x80\x99s identity, they think it could be a way to allow you to start your car, open the door to your house or send secure texts.\nBoth the Duke and NYU courses are interdisciplinary. At Duke, MBA and law students have been partnered up with computer science students to create up to nine mini start-up teams and, according to Prof Harvey, angel investors and venture capitalists are already offering work space and money for field trips, as they sniff around for access to potential new companies.\nFT Lexicon\n\nBitcoin \nBitcoin is a digital currency. Instead of printing banknotes or minting coins, a list of the registration numbers of each \xe2\x80\x9ccoin\xe2\x80\x9d and who owns them is kept. People pay one another by transferring the numbers online. But the system is anonymised so although there is a register, it is extremely difficult to track who owns what. This has attracted illegal acts in the past.\nBusinesses have now started accepting the currency as a means of payment. A list of retailers that accept Bitcoin can be found on Coinmap.org.\nBlockchain \nThe blockchain is essentially a giant record book of all Bitcoin transactions. In this decentralised network, every bitcoin transfer is verified, processed and written down.\nThe network relies on a combination of code-breaking and crowdsourcing that has the potential to make economic interactions cheaper, faster and more secure.\nThe idea is to remove the need for middlemen, banks for example, to vouch for facts, such as a person\xe2\x80\x99s identity or the health of their finances.\nOne such angel investor is Rahul Pagidipati, who looks after his family\xe2\x80\x99s portfolio of investments in the healthcare industry and believes that\ninsurance premiums and medical records could be transferred via the blockchain.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is probably going to happen in a college town,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cHopefully Duke will be one of the universities from which some really cool blockchain technologies will come out over the next few years.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe NYU course leans more heavily on the financial and legal ramifications of the core virtual currency and has been following how regulators worldwide are dealing with it.\nBitcoin has been effectively banned in some countries, such as Russia, while the US and the UK have allowed a certain amount of experimentation, even though they have pursued those using it for illegal acts.\nIt is this legal focus that attracted law student Eduardo Petry Veronese to the course.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAfter two big legal issues, a bankruptcy and a global criminal case, I got very interested in bitcoin \xe2\x80\x94 just like any good lawyer should,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. After graduation, he hopes to get involved in bitcoin regulation in his native Brazil.\nIn contrast to many of his students, who see bitcoin as a new kind of gold standard and a check against inflation, Prof Yermack casts himself as a bitcoin sceptic, at least when it comes to the potential to establish a global currency outside the purview of central banks.\nHe says his mission is to convert enthusiasts for the currency into enthusiasts for the underlying technology.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhat we are teaching is a set of issues and technologies,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe technology cannot be reversed. Certain sectors of banking are ripe for disruption, such as international money transfer, and bitcoin may be only a first move in what could be a real change in the payments system, so we are going to stick with this.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIt is a view echoed by Prof Harvey at Duke, the idea that something important has been invented, even if no one is quite sure what it is yet.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf you are teaching international finance, you are derelict not to give some attention to this invention,\xe2\x80\x9d Prof Harvey said.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEven if it does not work out, you have got to talk about the ideas percolating out there.\xe2\x80\x9d\n': 12, 'The Bitcoin tip for 2000 bits ($0.46) has been collected by *Atlas_84*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, "Tl;dr - universities are finding it necessary to explore Bitcoin.

It wasn\'t a "THEFT" as the thread implies--the idiot didn\'t enable 2FA (because he didn\'t "trust" it) and someone placed UNAUTHORIZED TRANSACTIONS using his account. That is not THEFT--nothing actually left his account.\n\nAny SANE company would ask for a police report/warrant before looking into it and their terms and conditions specifically spelled out that they don\'t care about people who don\'t use 2FA.\n\nThat is a terrible example to cite because the user whose account was hacked was an idiot. You should really ACTUALLY READ the thread before pasting it everywhere.\n\nUsers who refuse to take basic security precautions (such as 2FA) because they claim it could also be hacked are idiots and should not be given any attention. They only serve as a detriment to the entire community, and the sooner they learn some common sense (i.e. through the theft of their money) the better.\n\nNow, I\'m all for being sympathetic to someone whose computer is hacked in spite of their 2FA usage, I\'m all for being sympathetic to someone whose computer gets compromised through malware but this guy threw caution to the wind and didn\'t bother with 2FA and in doing so made a 40,000 USD error.\n\nActing at all like this guy took reasonable precautions or that he should somehow be reimbursed or have even more time spent discussing his situation is ludicrous. No 2FA in this day and age = 40,000 USD mistake. Period. It doesn\'t matter which exchange. Even if it was run by the most untrustworthy people on Earth.\n\nYou may argue that unauthorized access is still theft and I will not disagree at all, but that is something for the police to investigate; as nothing actually left his account there is no way for any exchange to help him in this instance beyond providing IP addresses that accessed his account.

A decentralized, public ledger. It keeps track of every single (Bitcoin) transaction that ever was. To explain this, let's assume you have 2 wallets and neither have enough to buy what you want.\n\nThe thing costs 15 BTC, you have Wallet A with 7 BTC and Wallet B with 10 BTC. So you decide to transfer everything from Wallet A to Wallet B. To do this, you have to prove to the network that you can actually pay for the transaction.\n\nThe software of Wallet A finds all transactions it can to fulfil the 7 BTC requirement and finds a 1 BTC, a 3 BTC, a 2 BTC and another 1 BTC transaction all going from someone to Wallet A. Together with the transaction to send 7 BTC from Wallet A to Wallet B and your signature this is presented to the network.\n\nThe network sees that you have the 7 BTC required and marks the 4 transactions used as proof as 'spend'. Then, 1 to a few confirmations later, 17 BTC is in Wallet B.\n\nNow let's look at the next situation. You have 17 BTC (in the form of an earlier 10 BTC transaction to Wallet B and the 7 BTC transaction from just now) in Wallet B. You enter 15 BTC to be paid and your wallet software starts looking. But it only finds the 10 BTC and 7 BTC transactions, too much. So it does the following; it provides those two transactions as proof, but instead of one 15 BTC to the store, there's a second 2 BTC transaction from Wallet B to Wallet B. It get's signed and the network checks.\n\nSince you provided a total of 17 BTC as proof and are spending a total of 17 BTC, this checks out and the provided proof transactions are marked as spend. 15 BTC goes to the store and 2 BTC is send back to Wallet B.\n\nSay you've decided to buy something else for 2 BTC, your wallet software can point towards the 'change' transaction (17 BTC - 15 BTC = 2 BTC as change) to prove you have 2 BTC. That then would be marked as 'spend' and you 'have 0 BTC in Wallet B'.\n\n> What is the Bitcoin?\n\nThe Bitcoins are hidden in plain sight, in the ledger of the Bitcoin network.

Primitive tribal societies, like still exist in Brazil, Borneo, the Andaman, etc.  have a much looser concept of property, almost none.  Sharing is very strong among them, as among husband and wife in civilized societies.  What one hunter kills, for example, is often shared with the tribe, even with those hunters who did not catch anything.  There is obvious survival value in that, and no incentive for cheaters.

And every time one account sends a portion or all of their balance to another account, the ledger gets a new entry showing that.\n\nDid you know that most U.S. dollars are digital? That is to say, if a bank says you have $1000 in your account, they don't actually have a physical box with your name on it and $1000 in cash sitting in that box. They have a digital balance sheet inside a computer that says you have $1000. And you trust the bank enough that if you want to go to the bank and withdraw that money they say you have, you'll get it all back.\n\nThe way bitcoin works is that it eliminates the need for us to trust banks to maintain the ledger because the ledger is appended and verified using mathematical algorithms, and the whole bitcoin protocol incentivizes the computers that do this ledger verification by paying them for their honest work. It turns out this verification process is what creates more bitcoin for the system, though there is a very finite supply of bitcoin that will ever be created.\n\nIn the end it's all just numbers on a balance sheet.

When your private key is used with other things to create your signature for that transaction it's a relative simple set of rules that you follow. When you check a signature it's a relative simple set of rules that the signature has to adhere to.

Whose property is it?\n\nPeople will always disagree about who *should* have possession of something.  Whose opinion is the "right" one?

If it were not for that, you could double-spend and not get caught until the next block.  The memory pool tells a node the address has been depleted, and therefore can\'t make another transaction.

It isn\'t others that guarantee my ownership, inasmuch as the concept presupposes the existence of others to be a concept.\n\nIf you imagine someone calling "shotgun!" to get the front seat, they are claiming that seat. Others will respect and don\'t take that seat insofar as they know what "shotgun!" means. They can also start fighting for the seat _despite_ knowing what "shotgun!" means. This is what Habermas refers to as going into practical discourse, where the "rules of calling shotgun!" comes into play.\n\nThey aren\'t laws, nor guaranteed by anyone, they are customary practices that are being practiced and socially reproduced (and once may perish). Historically, it\'s a genuine American phenomenon, wherein the front of the horse carriage would have room for two, and the one not reigning the horses would more likely than not be carrying a weapon. Today it has nothing to do with weapons or horses, but reservation of seats.\n\nProperty is the same kind of phenomenon, that is so important in society that it has _also_ been codified. In other societies there are other kinds of ownership, which a social anthropologist may inform us both about better than I can. In sum, property preceeds the laws, government, police what have you that _currently_ protects it.\n\nThat is not to say that they\'re irrelevant, not that you cannot think of property in those terms, nor that its being codified hasn\'t changed it (because it has! think about the British Empire "conquering the world by the cunning use of flags", in the words of Eddie Izzard). But they are contingent, not universal terms, so they don\'t cover the phenomenon we\'re facing.\n\n> When you gave me the sheep, it could have become my property \n\nNot at all. If I _gave_ you the sheep, it would be yours because that\'s what _giving_ means. If I _borrowed_ you the sheep, it would _not_be yours, because that\'s entailed in the concept of borrowing.

Property is the legal right to have possession of the thing; and rights are only meaningful if there is some authority (such as a government) that recognizes and enforces them.\n\nIf someone takes your car without a legal property transfer, he has possession of the car, but the car is still your property.  If he did not take it with your permission, a government that recognizes your property rights is supposed to use his courts and police to take the car from him and return it to your possession. \n\nThe blockchain is not connected to any government or legal system, so does not record property of bitcoins, only possession. It is like a storage facility where anyone who has the key to a storage shed can open it and take its contents to another shed.\n\nTo claim certain bitcoins as your property, you must have receipts or independent log transcripts that show that you mined them, bought them, earned them, or received them as  gift; and, in the last three cases, the person who gave you the bitcoins must have been their proprietor, otherwise you may have some hard explaining to do.  Moreover, these proofs of property must be accepted by the government whose help you intend to use in case of theft.\n\n"Theft" is the unauthorized possession of something that is the property of someone else.  Thus theft, like property, only exists with respect to some authority that recognizes and decides the property of bitcoins.\n\nThe US government, and presumably many others, has already settled that bitcoins are property.  So, for the US government, having the private key to an address does not imply being the proprietor of the coins in that address.

In _our_ societies these conventions have been codified in law, and we have (in principle) uniform execution of them with several layers of insurance.\n\nThe ontological difference is important: when you say that we\'re relying on the government to have property, you\'re focusing on the exception rather than the rule Property is not defined in terms of theft, rather, theft depends on property to exist as such.\n\nThere is a thirdness or convention in the execution of property.

This is _primarily_ what we actually and consistently rely on.\n\nThis thirdness can be backed up by honor, threat, love etc. and its embodiment are many, _including_ the government. But we mustn\'t confuse the backing up with the convention.\n\nFor instance, the laws covering the 1920s apartment block I live in are such that _no one owns a flat._ Instead each of the 18 owners are legally shareholders.\n\nHowever, there is _no confusion_ about who lives where and what flat is mine. If we went by law and not what laws try to protect, the other 17 owners could easily decide that the part I own is actually the hallway spaces.

They tumble them through another mathematical algorithm to try to create a number smaller than the current target. This number comes by rearranging the various transactions, info on the last set of transactions, and tossing in a random number. \n\nThe math is such that you can\'t work backwards. You can\'t tell what the number is until you\'ve run the calculations. So, if you do and your number isn\'t small enough, you try again with a different random number, or you rearrange the transactions, or you grab some new transactions. \n\nOnce you get a small enough number, you tell everyone else. The math, again, is such that it\'s easy for everyone to verify you found the correct arrangement of transactions and random number. \n\nOnce you broadcast that, everyone checks. If they agree, they immediately take the info from your block of transactions and start looking for the next small number.  The person who finds a block, i.e. finds that small number, gets rewarded with new bitcoins to spend. \n\nSo, the ability to spend a Bitcoin is tied to the math and your private key.

Any one can write a program that can do the math. There are a number of different programs. \n\nSo ultimately you "own" a bitcoin because you control the private key.

But, at least that would be closer to the truth.\n\nSo maybe the problem isn't borrowing, but the flawed approach accountants follow.  Even the IRS forces that kind of broken logic on businesses.  For example, if your business earns $100K in revenue and you use $75K to buy equipment to run your business, only a fraction of that $75K can be deducted as depreciation.  The balance is an asset and taxes due on that revenue.  If you paid employees, rent, utilities, etc. $25K, you'd have to borrow to pay taxes.  In short, the IRS wants its money even if that means reducing the purchasing power of a business.  Of course, the super-wealthy are OK with that, because they have the money to buy whatever: land, buildings, etc.  SMBs, though, are controlled.\n\nSo, they borrow in early years and pay more taxes.  And so it goes until they have money to escape that initial choke hold on their finances.\n\nAnyway, where I'm going with that is that I agree the system is corrupt and tailored to benefit those with lots of money.\n\nBorrowing is virtually forced on every citizen these days.  And, except in instances where we can peg the loan against an fixed asset that's not likely to drop in value, I still think loans are a bad idea.

Sure, without a manipulated interest rate, there will be more efficient investments (read: a lot fewer failing start-ups), but it won\'t solve poverty. So a global currency would increase the wealth gap (especially if it is mandatory like according to the IMF\'s plans); we\'d get gated communities and slums, very rich and wealthy regions, and poor ones that can\'t develop, because no one would want to invest in the infrastructure of the latter.

Older coins (coming from older transactions) are conventionally assigned higher priority, and thus will generally be included in a block sooner.\n\nAs your transaction is pending (unconfirmed), the coins it is spending are getting older and older every day, so the chance of finally getting confirmed is slightly increasing overtime.
