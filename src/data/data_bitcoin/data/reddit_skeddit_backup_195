But exact figures are hard to be sure of.  My testing shows a success rate of very close to 100% for concurrent transmission double-spends. And the cases where most people exploit double spends today are ones where they can just retry.  I\'m personally aware of over 1.1 million dollars in losses from accepting unconfirmed transactions, and these were parties who were already taking extensive \'precautions", and I\'m sure there is much more losses that I\'m not aware of. Opt-in RBF may have some zero conf safety advantages: the replacements that it does accept are safely relayable without creating a DOS attack risk-- so you can learn about conflicts (of that limited kind) faster and more reliably; for whatever good that does you.\n\nBut in spite the experience worn, science backed, skepticism about zero conf and the widespread belief by most technical experts that any security it has comes almost entirely from causes outside of Bitcoin... nothing currently planned* or implicated by Opt-in RBF prevents people from wanting to use it.  Rather, it just avoids other people who don\'t want to use it from having it\'s costs imposed on them too. And I think that giving people the freedom to use their Bitcoins in the way they (and their trading partners) mutually consent, without cost or impact on third parties, amplifies the value of Bitcoin.\n\n(*) That said, non-RBF behavior is short term incentive incompatible for miners. It\'s impossible for the system to impose it, so anyone counting on it is trusting anonymous self selecting miners to play nice.  Cooperation with that rule is likely an unstable equilibrium. So, while there are no plans around core to do anything except opt-in RBF I think an eventual outcome where miners RBF everything seems likely, though I consider this regrettable.\n\nAs an aside, a lot of the tone of these discussions seems perplexing to me.  [Opt-in replacement was a feature in the very first release of Bitcoin](https://github.com/trottier/original-bitcoin/blob/master/src/main.cpp#L434) using the same field to signal it (the sequence field, which is explicitly intended for signaling replaceability). It was deactivated due to DOS attacks, but Petertodd figured out how to prevent the DOS attacks (by requiring that the replacements increase the fee by the fee-to-relay amount, which also makes replacement incentive compatible-- and thus more likely to reliably work and thus more usable). Similarly, in spite of over a dozen attempted-slanderous threads not myself nor anyone at blockstream has anything to do with Opt-in RBF beyond understanding it and thinking it\'s a useful functionality to restore.': 6, 'If two double-spending transactions are sent simultaneously, each to a different node, then the merchant sees his transaction and a miner confirms the other in 25% of the attempts.': 3, '> I like to assume nothing but good intentions on the part of Core devs and /u/nullc who I highly respect.\n\nThat\'s nice.

A merchant may accept 0-conf low value payments if the probability of a double spend is very small. However if the probability increases, the treshold value at which a merchant is willing to accept a 0-conf transaction decreases proportionally. The merchant has *amount* x P(*doublespend*) at risk, so if P(*doublespend*) increases, the amount will decrease.

Like a programming grammar nazi, [nullc took a similar statement by me to respond, basically "lulz! talking about network *and* node??? Clearly you don\'t understand!!

But it\'s asinine to pretend like it\'s impossible for the network (collective set of the nodes) to have seen transaction A first. And if so, then under current behavior, they would collectively reject a conflicting transaction B.\n\nAnd rather than talk about they change, again, they just want to dodge and ignore that very central point about current network behavior and instead point out the current difficulty of knowing whether or not a given transaction has been widely propagated. [And they want to do more to make that difficult.](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/7093) Oh, no, no, excuse me, clearly that\'s a very sophisticated DDoS defense and not at all a way to make 0-conf / tracking transaction propagation more difficult.': 0, 'The probability of that working has been shown to be near zero by Peter ': 1, "Isn't it already possible to negotiate fees with miners by sending multiple identical transactions with increasing fees combined with increasing eligible-for-inclusion block heights upfront?\n\n[Detailed explanation](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3untsx/who_uses_0conf_transactions/cxgkwiv).": 4, 'This is correct!': 7, ">Opt-In RBF:  It's useful to some people, they should be free to use it among themselves\n\nAgree.

Mining nodes are purposefully hard to find because otherwise they get DOS attacked by other miners and people attempting extortion.   A connects to B, C, D.   Service connects to C, D, and 4000 other nodes. \n\nThe attacker (\'s software) can learn which nodes a service is connected to by making two equivalent payments (like FSS RBF) to the node in question and the rest of the network and checking which the service sees. Similarly this can be used to identify which nodes feed miners transactions (by seeing which versions end up in which blocks). With this map in hand.  Attacker sends the merchant transaction to B,C,D and the conflict to A all concurrently.  Everything the resource sucking "detection" sees has the payment and not the conflict. The propagation of the conflict is blocked by B, C, D.  The first they see it will be in the blockchain, even if the next block takes minutes.\n\nSo no, there is no convergence to certainty as you expect. There is nothing consistent, not even in the eventual sense, about mempools-- at least not once there are conflicts. \n\nThe aforementioned 1.1 million in losses were from parties using \'sophisticated detection techniques\'.  This basic attack pattern can be amplified by using non-uniformity in relay policy and other tricks that require constant vigilance on detection software design and still end up with big blindspots that go unnoticed until exploited (not to mention if miners are complicit...). Worse, most people are just not in a good position to really understand the risk surface so that the bet that make is the one they intended to make-- they think things first is universal, or that mempools converge.': 6}, ("BBC's Click this week talked about blockchain / smart contracts for Artists.

So almost any transaction with the minimum fee gets included since the cost to add it is almost always less than the fee. In this world a minimum suggested fee works just fine. \n\nIf you imagine a time when Bitcoin becomes very popular, it\'s quite likely that full blocks become the norm (even if the limit is raised) (and please can we not turn this thread into a blocksize debate).\n\nSo consider that scenario. In that world of almost-always-full blocks there needs to be a way to discover the price of the space in the block. If you have a transaction the only sure way to get it seen is to "shoot high" with an arbitrarily large fee. What\'s needed is a way to bid on the space you need for your transaction, so you pay the minimum price needed to get your txn through.\n\nRBF creates a way for the software to do this. You send the txn with the fee that your wallet suggests as the best fee to get your txn seen in the next N blocks. If there aren\'t a lot of urgent txns competing for the space then your txn probably goes though. If on the other hand there is a lot of urgent competition for the space then your txn may not get into the block desired. RBF lets your wallet bid-up the txn so you get more priority.\n\nAnyone can get their txn included by attaching an unusually high fee, but consider if blocks are full and lots of people are doing this, they\'re all overpaying.\n\nRBF in theory can allow you to submit your txn with the lowest fair fee and then bid it up.\n\nThis could/should lead to better price discovery for space on the blockchain and lower average fees in full blocks.\n\nEdit: to everyone with questions about why it was implemented this way and not some other way, I\'m here to explain, not defend.

The consensus rules say nothing about how to prioritize conflicting zero confirmation transactions; in this sense, first-seen, RBF, CPFP, first-seen-safe RBF, etc., all have existed since the creation of Bitcoin; miners have always been free to use any of those strategies.\n\nIf you\'re interested in use cases, that\'s fine. Just know that the question excludes the perspective under which this update *has not added RBF to Bitcoin*, but merely added support for RBF to a particular client of Bitcoin.': 4, 'In a Bitcoin transaction, you cannot "only change the mining fee". A transaction is made of inputs (the UTXOs or "coins") and outputs (the "addresses"). When the sum of the inputs is greater that the sum of the outputs, the difference is kept by the miners as mining fees.\n\nSo in order to change the mining fee, you need to change some inputs or some outputs. With "First-seen safe RBF", you can require that the outputs don\'t change, but it then requires new inputs every time you want to increase the mining fee so it is less efficient than "Full RBF", where you are allowed to change the outputs.\n\nThe idea here is that, in order to increase the mining fee, you keep the same inputs but simply decrease the change (the amount of bitcoin that is returned to one of your own addresses). But since miners can\'t know wich address is yours and which address belongs to the payee, they can\'t guarantee that you are not converting some of the original payment into fees...\n\nDoes that make sense? And now that I come to think of it, another solution could be to somehow "flag" the change address in the transaction: that would allow for some transactions to be replaced-by-fee only if *some* outputs stay the same...

The receiver of an RBF-able transaction (merchant) will therefore wait in more cases until the transaction gets into a block before they considers it is safe to assume the transaction will eventually become irreversible. In other words: a merchant is likely to only accept RBF- able transactions for very small amounts or not at all. Edit: although /u/nullc points out that a determined double spender can remain completely undetected by sending transactions directly to miners, causing the double spend transaction to be first seen when it is in a block, in other words when it is too late. Reportedly millions have been lost by this scheme - it is not just some theoretical possibility. Again follow the link to his comment above where /u/nullc explains this in more detail.\n\n* The user experience is horrible. If blocks become full, do we want a situation in which users have to bring their wallet online an hour after doing a transaction in order to let it check if said transaction made it into a block? So the wallet gets the chance to RBF it in case it didn't? That's just a horrendous and completely unintuitive user experience.\n\nSo basically it seems RBF enables a payer to negotiate over the fee amount. But in a rather clumsy way. A payers wallet has to keep an eye on their transaction to see whether it gets included into a block, and when it doesn't, use RBF. The time between sending the initial transaction and the RBF transaction can be hours.\n\nIt would be more smooth and intuitive if a payer can just instruct a wallet once to do a payment and still can be highly certain that it will be accepted eventually. The wallet should structure a payment such that it allows miners to compete on fee amount.\n\nTechnically I imagine the wallet pays by sending multiple transactions simultaneously in such a way that it forces miners to compete on fee. Unless I am overlooking something, I think this is already possible now with *only wallet software changes*. It goes like this:\n\nImagine that the next block is block number B. The payer sends the following three transactions all at once with increasing fee amounts:\n\nTx1: pay with fee f (normal tx).\nTx2: identical to Tx1 but pay with fee f+i1; do not include into a block before block B+1.\nTx3: identical to Tx1 but pay with fee x+i2 (i2 > i1); do not include into a block before block B+2.\n\nEach miner has the following two simple options:\n\nInclude Tx1 in block B for a low fee.\nDo not include Tx1 in block B. This has a high probability of losing out on the transaction fee, but if blocks are full and all other transactions carry a higher fee amount then this is an economically rational decision.\n\nIf a miner that did not include Tx1 finds block B, then Tx1 remains unconfirmed and in the mempools.\n\nBoth Tx1 as well as Tx2 carrying a higher fee can now be included into block B+1. Tx2 is now more likely to be included into block B+1 because each miner is more likely to want to secure the higher fee carried by Tx2. Still an altruistic miner may still chose to accept Tx1 and its lower fee.\n\nIf Tx2 is still not included, Tx3 becomes eligible for inclusion carrying a yet higher fee.\n\nThe end result is that the payer just sends off three transactions of which only one can be included, but such that it forces miners to compete on fees. By looking at the fee amounts of the transactions, the payer as well as the receiver can know the probability of the payment being settled, which will approach 100% if the payment includes a transaction with a non-zero transaction fee.\n\nThe only change needed to make this work I guess is for miners being able to recognize that three transactions having the same inputs and outputs but differing fee amounts are not a double spend attempt but a negotiation of the fee amount.\n\nIf I am not mistaken it is perhaps already possible now without *any* changes to Core.": 13, 'The wallet should automate it. \n\nFor POS transactions where RBF is not the default, [I suggested this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3upbe3/brainstorming_can_point_of_sale_rbf_snafus_be/) elsewhere.

Merchants will be able to see this, so will know not to trust your transaction until it has confirmations. \n\nTo fully understand RBF, you must realize that zero-confirmation (0-conf) transactions in Bitcoin are never guaranteed to be safe. The only reason they are moderately safe to accept is that most nodes will not relay a double spend of a transaction they have already seen. Many companies like BitPay and Coinbase have technology to check if a transaction has been seen by most of the Bitcoin network, then accept it before it has any confirmations. However, Bitcoin\'s primary mechanism for guaranteeing that a transaction will not be double spent is mining them into the blockchain, so if you want to be sure a transaction is safe you should always wait for at least a few confirmations. \n\nYou should also know that accepting double spends is purely rational behavior for miners. If they see a transaction that double spends an existing, unconfirmed transaction, and has a higher miner fee, then it is in their best interest to accept the new transaction with a higher fee. This means that miners are theoretically leaving money on the table. \n\nThere are two reasons that Peter Todd has been pushing RBF for quite a while:\n\n1) Unconfirmed transactions are not technically safe to rely on, but some people do. We should break them for everyone so that people no longer rely on this behavior. \n\n2) Sometimes people make a transaction and forget to add a fee, or add a fee that is too low. If the transaction is taking too long to confirm (for example during a Bitcoin stress test, or period of high volume), it would be nice if people could replace this transaction with a new one with a higher fee.\n\nThe second point is actually a decent use case. Todd had an alternative proposal called "first seen safe" replace-by-fee, which would allow you to increase the fee on an existing transaction, but not change the recipient address, meaning that it does not allow you to double spend merchants. However, this option was not merged into Bitcoin core. The version that was merged allows you to replace your transaction with a completely different one sending money to different people (or back to yourself).\n\nEdit: for all the folks downvoting me, if it\'s not clear already, I don\'t actually agree with the points above, or RBF in general.

The fraudster gets the goods, the payment is now going to a miner instead of the merchant, and the merchant is left with nothing.\nSince the miner gets the payment, the fraudster does not get it back. **Therefore, the fraudster has no reason to ever attempt the double spend.**~~  \n\nPlease ignore: luke-jr's CPFP (child pays for parent) will not be included in this Bitcoin Core, so the comment above is inaccurate.": 3, "If your coworker Bob sends you an opt-in RBF transaction to repay you for lunch, are you really going to sit there with Bob - wallet open - until it confirms?

The current behavior of core nodes says that if a transaction is in the mempool and someone tries to issue a new transaction spending the same coins, just drop the new one because it looks like a double spend.  Replace by fee says that if the second transaction has a higher fee than the first transaction, then drop the first one and take the second instead.\n\nPractically, this can be used like this:\nAlice sends coins to Bob with 0 transaction fee because it's not a high priority transaction.  Some time later Bob asks Alice to expedite the funds because he has an opportunity to use the coins that won't last very long, but the transaction is still unconfirmed.  Alice could then re-issue a transaction of the coins to Bob with a fee that would presumably get accepted into a block faster than the previous transaction.\n\nSounds decent, right?\n\nThere are downsides too though, so do your homework if you're going to weigh in:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinxt/comments/3uje8o/consensus_jgarzik_rbf_would_be_antisocial_on_the/\n\nLike most things, this is not a  black and white issue like many make it seem.

Even if the merchant and scammer can fight it out, there\'s always a chance - even a good chance - that the fees will not escalate to 100% before the next block comes and locks everything in place. If that happens, the scammer may either pay 100% or something less than 100% of the purchase price, and the merchant will receive less than 100%, perhaps even 0% of the purchase price.\n\nIn other words, in a fight, the merchant will always lose some money and the attacker will often pay less than they should.\n\nAll this means that everyone is incentivised to attack, and merchants are incentivised to simply stop accepting Bitcoin because it\'s too costly and too much hassle.\n\nThe "too much hassle" also becomes a factor when merchants have to be careful not to accept RBF transactions, and newbies get their transactions ignored by merchants because they were playing around with their wallet and didn\'t know what the RBF function was.

": 1, 'This was a very well written critique, and highly commendable at that.\n\n> If retailers are unable to mitigate the risk of fraud when accepting unconfirmed transactions, then they simply wont accept Bitcoin.\n\nRetail usage is a special case of individual usage. Charitably assuming the retailer is a Bitcoin user in a post-fiat world, he\'s figuring out a way to accept BTC from his customers. If that means he needs to install Authorize.net for Bitcoin, so be it.\n\nBut in today\'s world, most retailers are working with Coinbase or BitPay. The retailers don\'t care to accept BTC, they care to process payments for a low fee. In which case, would it really be so bad to have a LN wallet for access to BitPay or Coinbase merchants? Nothing important is lost by doing this.\n\n> So a new attack would look like this: Create two transactions; One sending coins to the merchant with a second output sending a small amount of coins to a gambling service. Then create a normal double spend transaction. Send the first transaction to the merchant, walk out the store with the merchandise, then send the double spend to the Eligius pool. At the time of writing Eligius has about 3% of the hashing power. That means you have a 3% chance that Eligius will mine the next block containing your double spend. A 3% chance of success is still fairly low, but you can repeat this over and over again until it works.\n\nRight, and at 10,000 attempts per day - it\'s on average 300 successful double spends per day - but let\'s say the merchant is contracting with a proprietary SaaS provider such as BlockCypher. Now there\'s a big chance BlockCypher protects against MOST of the ones that get away.\n\nBut there will always be successful attempts, and regardless it doesn\'t seem prudent or in the spirit of Bitcoin to have to rely on a trusted third party to safely accept payments. It sounds like this policy rewards large Corporations under heavy regulatory scrutiny - while giving mom and pop shops little other alternative but to contract with similar Corporations for protection.\n\nBut this pales in comparison to the importance of *having the ability to bump your fee*, and just strikes to the heart of this debate. You simply can\'t have a healthy fee market without RBF fee bumping. If you can\'t have a fee market, then you need gigablocks and you need to stuff all of this payment processing shit into the core of the P2P network bloating it SUBSTANTIALLY in size.\n\n> Of course if you have to do this for every mining pool, it can be cumbersome, but it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean that it wont work as a risk mitigation strategy\n\nWhat small business owner has the skills or excess capital to afford their own "risk mitigation strategy" for payments? No, they\'ll have to buy it from a payment processor. And if they\'re going to be dependent on a payment processor in lieu of accepting BTC as normal - why aren\'t they also willing to accept payments over LN? If they just do that, we don\'t have any of these problems. It strikes me as a simple, workable solution that keeps the core of the network highly agile.\n\n> That is, if retailers still bother with Bitcoin by that point.\n\nI doubt if the mantra of "cheaper fees" is how Bitcoin really "makes it" in retail. Rather, Bitcoin will hit retail like the iPhone hit enterprise customers. The customers THEMSELVES will have invested in Bitcoin because it is a better base currency than fiat, and after that they\'re obviously going to figure out a way to accept it at their place of business, be it on the blockchain with a wait time or through an Authorize.net for Bitcoin solution.': 2, '> Well, this is a pull in Blockstream Core\n\nWhat does that even mean?': 3, "> He will try again.\n\n\nThat doesn't mean your statement is true.\n\n\nWhat passes for evidence in your world?": 0, 'Proof?': -2, 'Very good explanation of RBF.

I'll be here for the next hundred years to see it through because I will partner with Abrey De Grey on life extension and will see the bitcoin network through.": 1, "It's a problem for the person losing their bitcoin.\n\nIt isn't a problem for Bitcoin.": 1, "And from the 99% point of view that's a good thing. \n\n": 3, "that's not heaven, that's the top 1%": 0, "People will give you this weird answer that it's somehow okay because other people will still have their bitcoin and can divide them smaller and smaller. \n\nAs if somehow people constantly losing bitcoin isn't itself a huge massive issue.

Now at $375 -- few are keeping 100 bitcoins without taking precautions to protect them. \n\ni.e. as the exchange rate rises, a lower and lower number of bitcoins will be lost.      As bitcoins are lost, the exchange rate rises.   Rinse, repeat, continue.\n\nBut problem?  Nope.

Bitcoin should last forever, in principle.': 4, 'But then the value will ultimately become deflationary, permanently.': 1, "Heaven forbid everyone who holds bitcoin gets wealthier as the economy grows.
