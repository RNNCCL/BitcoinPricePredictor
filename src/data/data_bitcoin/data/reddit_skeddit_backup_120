Proving data is valid by providing an audit trail is not their business model. Their business model is to *record the occurrence of some claim* in a way it can be trusted (by committing a proof of these claims in the blockchain).\n\nThe actual claim is open for interpretation to the user; they would still have to verify whether the claim holds any ground - but they can be sure the claim was made by some given entity at some given time.\n\nFor example, you could claim you have ownership over the deed to a house by committing this claim to the Factom network, and show, to anyone, at a later time, that you have made this claim when you did. The Factom network can *prove* to anyone that you, indeed, have made a claim.\n\nWhether the claim is valid (whether it's a valid deed to a house) remains to be determined by investigating the actual claim. And this is not something the Factom network can (or should) provide.": 1, ".. and this is already present with the proof-work-chain down to genesis.

One thing it can't do is prove data is valid according to some frame - without having the data or the frame. It can certainly never be used to spin up a fully validating Bitcoin node, because the network itself is dependent on the valid (and correct) Bitcoin blockchain.": 1, 'I suppose the protocol itself could talk to a factom api to hash its own state of itself into itself for nodes to reference to.

Development: the Core devs are making it clear that it\'s their way or nothing.  Even if we accept 95% of their vision and code, if we make any changes that they don\'t like, they will do everything they can to destroy the new fork, including new PoW algorithms, DDOS attacks on nodes that adopt new code, censorship in this forum etc.  I want decentralized, competitive development, where the community can adopt whatever software it wants, that\'s why I oppose the core dictatorship.\n\n2.  Core devs claim that moving to 2 MB would reduce the full node count.  Maybe, it\'s not clear.  Encouraging more users might actually increase the full node count.  Even if they\'re right and the full node count falls from say 5500 to 4000, they\'ve made no meaningful argument about just how much "centralization" this reflects.  Blockstream itself just raised $21m in funding.  It costs less than $500 all-in to run a node for a year. Meaning if blockstream wanted, they could single handedly double the full node count using less than 10% of their financing.  I think this whole argument is just a red herring.\n\n3. Mining - there\'s no evidence that either core or classic will help decentralize mining.\n\n"resilience to change" is not a good property for a technology in beta at all.  Bitcoin is nothing today.  It is all potential.  To achieve its potential, it must continue to evolve and adapt, or it will be replaced by FinTech that is more dynamic.  I don\'t want bitcoin to become the next friendster or AOL dialup, I want it to remain dynamic enough to take over the world.  \n\nTLDR if you want a decentralized, successful, robust bitcoin, you have to abandon the Core Dev / Blockstream Mafia dictatorship.': 3, "Hoarding doesn't add a burden to the network; what's your point?": 1, '>LN is designed to be an offchain agreement until it is broadcast as a transaction to the network (thus limiting the burden on the network); it is not going to force a larger block size for a long time. \n\nLN will reduce the load on the network if bitcoiner use the network on a daily basis, otherwise they will keep using onchain Tx. \n\nHow many Tx the average Bitcoin user send?

It is not a scaling solution... it's just a way of showing how fast people want their transactions confirmed.\n\nImagine being told that there is a really cool party going on and anyone can get in line to go in, but only so many people are allowed in every 10 minutes. Then people start to notice that the line is getting really long (like a 100+ minute wait) more often.

Even if miners receive ten times as much fee revenue due to constricted block size, that would still pale in comparison to the profits that could be gained from price appreciation which would occur when the market gets confident that Bitcoin will scale. So in any rational analysis the incentive for miners to prove to the market that they can scale Bitcoin should outweigh the incentive for them to skim more transaction fees.': 2, "What if it's not arbitrary but based on real data and tests?

So calculating the cost per transaction is meaningless. The transactions have *almost* nothing to do with the cost. No I won't do the search for all the other threads on this topic for you. At least not today. I haven't had breakfast yet, and it's now dinner time.\n\nEdit: Also, note that the money spent is not being consumed for the service of securing the transaction. It still exists - in the form of bitcoin. So a miner buying electricity with USD to mine bitcoin achieves the same thing economically as a trader on the exchange buying bitcoin directly with his USD.\n\nIt's equivalent if you think in terms of energy. Say a guy with solar panels has energy to sell back to the grid. He can either sell it, or mine bitcoins with it.\n\nSituation A: If he chooses to mine bitcoins, was that energy wasted?\n\nSituation B: What if he sells it back to the grid for USD and then goes on an exchange and buys bitcoins with his USD? Was the energy wasted?\n\nI'm sure in situation B you would say the energy was not wasted, it was used. But the two situations achieve the exact same effect.

If doing so your node comes to the conclusion that the transaction is valid it relays that transaction to its connected nodes which do the whole shebang again.\n\nWhat a miner does additionally is kinda to grab the current state of the ledger including all the yet unconfirmed valid transactions and put that in a new block, which it then relays to all the other nodes and miners.\n\nWhile all participants of the network check the accounting and validate transactions, miners also create a copy of the state of everything every ten minutes and put it in a folder from which nothing can ever be erased again.\n\n': 1, 'Miners determine the history, all nodes verify the history before accepting it.

If it is valid it propagates through the network and ends up in the queue of miners.\n\nWhen a miner solves a block and chooses to include one of these valid transactions, the transaction is now **confirmed** and is considered by the network to be spent.

Currently bitcoin transactions go through in less than a second. With bitmessage it would take 2-3 minutes and you would kill your battery on mobile. The UX would be so poor no one would use it.\n\n>Also, bitmessage has scalability issues. It requires all clients to store all messages despite there being no consensus requirement (like in bitcoin) that would necessitate it. And since it's basically a network of volunteers, it has to use POW as a somewhat awkward hack to ration disk space.\n\n>And finally bitmessage is heavyweight protocol, unsuitable for lite clients. \n\nThere were other issues with Bitmessage that make it unsafe to use, some of which were fixed.
