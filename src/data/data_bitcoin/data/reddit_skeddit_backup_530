And, all of these things have value, not necessarily *monetary* value, and currencies are the language by which this value is expressed.\n\nI don't understand /u/andreasma's attempt at making a distinction between monetary value and other kinds of value. Indeed, if the language that is currency is being used to express the value of these things, then by definition, these things have a monetary value.\n\nPerhaps there is a cultural fear of reifying something like, say, friendship; however, it doesn't stop the fact that, say, a friendship apparently is a matter of material value.": 2, 'Yeah, I never got that.

A dollar in one set of hands has the same purchasing power as a dollar in another set of hands.\n\nThis is not true for other kinds of value, because value of all forms is inherently subjective. The brilliance of money is that it creates a psuedo-objective form of value.\n\nIt isn't that monetary value is inherently better or worse than other forms of value, but monetary value has the special ability to be objectively measured, which can't be said of other forms of value. It is in fact this special ability which gives it value (or increases the value of the thing being used as money in the instance of consumable-good money like lolipops, cigarettes, etc).\n\nI like Amy as a friend but it is impossible to measure that value I have for that friendship on a scale that is meaningful to other people. I can say I like Amy more than I like Todd, but less than I like Jeremy and objectively rank my preferences. But there is no 'measuring stick' where I can say I like Amy 42 units, Todd 27 units, and Jeremy 113 units, and have those units be meaningful in an objective way.\n\nI think Andreas is making a genius level point, that once cryptocurrency become ubiquitous it makes it easier to objectively measure some of these values that are currently opaque.

So within an existing monetary system, people aren't just forced to all work for bank overlords.\n\nNow the next question might be if we've just switched overlords, from commercial banks to government.
