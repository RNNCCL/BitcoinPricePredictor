Traditionally, the amount of time required to pass in order for a transaction to gain "economic substance" depended on the volatility of the market. The more volatile, the less time was needed.  And visa-versa.  \n\nIt goes without saying that bitcoin is an extremely volatile asset, so we can probably safely assume that you do not need to wait very long.  30 days (which is the requirement under Section 1091 for wash sales of stocks and securities) is certainly long enough, but would essentially defeat the point.  Conversely, waiting only a matter of minutes is almost as certainly not long enough.  \n\nSo, where does the magic number lie?  It\'s impossible to say for certain.  One day is definitely on the low end and probably the shortest amount of time that you could conceivably get away with (but it would still be quite risky).  I would tend to think something in the three to five day range is more appropriate, with a week or more being a safer choice for those who want to eliminate the risk of the economic substance doctrine as much as possible.  At the end of the day, the decision is up to you --  just keep in mind that longer is better.  \n\n*Example: Instead of immediately repurchasing the bitcoins he sold, Bob from the previous example waits five days to make the repurchase.  In the mean time, the price of bitcoin fluctuates 5% each day, but ends up at almost the exact same price that he sold them.  Bob repurchases the same amount of bitcoin at this price.  If Bob were audited, he would have a strong argument that the transaction did not lack economic substance because he exposed himself to the market risk of bitcoin, regardless of the fact that he was able to repurchase at the same price five days later.* \n\n**#14 Should I use wash sales to generate losses by the end of the year?**\n\nMaybe.  Typically the strategy of "taking losses" is used to offset gains that you might\'ve had on other investments during the year.  In that case, using a wash sale to generate losses could help reduce your taxes considerably.  \n\nOn the other hand, a wash sale essentially resets your cost basis and holding period.  By that I mean you now own the bitcoin at the new purchase price and the new purchase date.  So, you\'ll have to weigh the possibility of higher capital gains in the future, as well as the possibility of losing long-term status,   against the current year tax savings.  \n\n*****************************\nConclusion\n*****************************\nAt the end of the day, losses on bitcoins are treated just the same as losses on shares of stock, with one exception: the wash sale rules of Section 1091 do not apply.   Regardless, a wash sale lacking economic substance can be invalidated by the IRS, so it\'s a good idea to wait at least a few of days before repurchasing. \n\nI\'ll try to answer any questions, but keep in mind this is general information only and not legal advice.\n': 27, 'You want every road to become a toll road?': 2, '500 bits /u/changetip': 2, "If I made a large purchase with Bitcoin but the purchase was at a loss, how might I record that?

You will figure out you are on the wrong chain soon enough (when you go to spend money you thought you had but really didn't to someone who isn't in on the conspiracy).\n\nIt doesn't even have to be an attack, if it is trust based, you may just end up using a different currency than other people over time. You also may trivially be isolated and scammed, but ignoring that, the fact that the consensus depends on trusting a set of people then only realizing you and a merchant are on a different blockchain indicates a weak consensus.\n\n>Remember short-range nothing-at-stake problems are solved by DPOS and some other PoS coins by penalizing double-signers.\n\nPenalizing double signers is a joke. I explained that penalizing double signers depends on attackers releasing their second signature, or being **honest**. Your security assumption can't be expect attackers to be honest.\n\n>The only people who can make forks are current delegates because you know who the top 101 delegates are and those are the only ones who can produce blocks. If you want to break that assumption then you are either implying a long-range stake attack (which I already addressed) or a 51% stake attack which is way more expensive to do than a 51% hash power attack on Bitcoin.\n\nNot if you are out of consensus. If you are fed a forked of the blockchain everyone else is using then you are out of consensus. That is the long range attack. The short range attack is colluding delegates or censoring colluding delegates or sybil delegates or NaS on the stakeholders of before when the attack started or many of the other attacks made possible by NaS. The most critical of these attacks, I believe, is not accepting reorgs. If you won't accept a blockchain that is taller and says another set of delegates are correct then an attacker can attempt to time the release of this fork so half the network accepts one set of delegates and half the network accepts another, breaking consensus until a central authority/trusted party corrects it.\n\n>Also, in my second example with the opportunity cost being 1 full year, the security provided by DPOS ($213,282,000) is greater than the security provided by PoW ($195,570,000). You have to realize that most delegates will be giving up their real identities. They cannot just try to carry out an attack, throw away their fake identity when they get caught, and do it again for another two weeks worth of pay for the registration cost. Once they are out for double-signing, they are out for good. Another set of at least 51 colluding individuals would have to convince the stakeholders that they are honest delegates in order to get voted in and try to repeat an attack.\n\nUnless there is some consensus breaking reorg prevention mechanism, you don't need to be a delegateto make a fork.\n\n>By the time an attacker can buy control of private keys of old delegates or old stakeholders enough time would have passed that the blockchain would not reorganize to another chain with a fork point starting that far in the past.\n\nOh, the reorg prevention, right. I will expand on reorgs a bit here. Lets say that that the blockchain won't reorg past 1000 blocks (I don't know the actual number). This means that if I create a fork at block 20000, I can release my fork including blocks 20000 to 21001 right as the main fork is releasing block 21001. I can do some research and time it so half the network accepts my fork and is permanently on my fork since the rest of the network won't accept it, or they are on the other fork. This is breaking consensus permanently.\n\n>If the client is starting from genesis, they would need a more recent checkpoint (at most 6 months old should be fine). The checkpoint does not have to be centralized. I already discussed that in the first paragraph of my previous post and the first two paragraphs of this post.\n\nIf your checkpoints aren't centralized then you need some consensus mechanism so everyone has the same checkpoints. So you need to solve the consensus problem once more. Was DPoS not enough? If it was then the decentralized checkpoint shouldn't be necessary. It would be pointless to put DPoS on top of DPoS.": 3, "I don't think we should treat Bitcoin blockchain as a general purpose tool and cram features into it just because they need a blockchain.

I have no way of knowing if the NSA has a warehouse in their back pocket ready at any time to shut down Bitcoin on demand.  \n\nIn PoS I always know what kind of attack powers exist because it's all on the blockchain.  If a government/large organization wanted to do something nefarious, they would have to spend untold millions driving up the price to unimaginable heights.

You also may trivially be isolated and scammed, but ignoring that, the fact that the consensus depends on trusting a set of people then only realizing you and a merchant are on a different blockchain indicates a weak consensus.\n\nLet\'s say you synchronized your blockchain to the correct chain up to the present time. If you keep the amount of time you are offline short enough (how short is a matter of debate but I think 1 month or less is sufficient), then the economic design of DPOS allows you to feel confident anyone trying to get you on another chain will find it economically disadvantageous to do so. This doesn\'t require further trusting people. It just requires believing in the game theory. It is similar to PoW in this sense because you assume the design of PoW makes it economically disadvantageous for anyone to try to buy up 51% of hashing power to trick you onto a fake chain. So, this is solving the short-range nothing-at-stake problem, not the long-range nothing-at-stake problem.\n\nOne thing to clarify about the above is that even if your internet is compromised for some time, you are only in a period of weaker security during that period where the internet is compromised. But after you reconnect to the real internet, you will be able to get back on the right fork (assuming you weren\'t isolated for months of course). Also, even during the time your internet is compromised, although there is weaker security, it doesn\'t mean there is no security. There is still some opportunity cost that *will* have to be paid by your attacker. However, as we discussed earlier, if you wait long enough (whether it is 1 hour or a few hours), PoW can provide better security per cost for this *particular* attack vector (double-spend attacks in an environment of completely compromised internet) than DPOS.\n\nThe long-range nothing-at-stake problem is the attack vector where an attacker either buys enough old stake (in order to create a fake blockchain history by voting in their own delegates) or just buys the old delegate\'s private keys. Keep in mind if they want to buy the old delegate\'s private keys, they need to buy the keys of a set of delegates (or at least a sufficiently large percentage of them, say 80% to be convincing to their victim) that were in the top 101 ranks all *at the same time* in some point in the blockchain history.\n\n> Penalizing double signers is a joke. I explained that penalizing double signers depends on attackers releasing their second signature, or being honest. Your security assumption can\'t be expect attackers to be honest.\n\nOnce again I believe you are confusing two different problems (SRNaS vs LRNaS). Maybe we have different definitions of it and that is the problem? Once the LRNaS problem is solved thanks to checkpoints, it means the only one who can produce blocks and thus potentially trick you are a colluding group of at least a majority of currently elected delegates. So they will be producing a second signature on the real chain. If they are not that means the secret blockchain presented to you is the "real" consensus chain, not the fake one! Everyone else on the "real" internet will see consensus stop and see it as the network being down.\n\n\nI don\'t have time right now to go through the rest of your comments and give them the proper attention they deserve. From a quick glance, I don\'t believe the forked block attacks you mention would work.\n\nBut it seems like you have spent some time thinking about this and you care enough to respond. So why don\'t you carry this discussion over to bitsharestalk.org rather than an obscure deeply nested reddit thread so that more knowledgeable people (like the devs) can address your concerns? After all, if you *truly* believe you have a realistic attack on DPOS, then I am sure we in the BitShares community would all love to know about it and would most likely be willing to pay a bounty (in BTC) for the discovery of a potential serious security issue.

Checkpoints aren\'t a problem once you embrace weak subjectivity and realize the checkpoints only practically matter to clients synchronizing with the network after a long period (several months) of being offline. Checkpoints are also not a centralization risk because you don\'t need to trust the developers for the validity of the checkpoints. You can ask anyone who has a stored recent copy of the blockchain. Ask enough people unlikely to collude together, and you can be very confident it is the "correct" one. And once again you hardly ever have to do this since your synchronization period will usually be quite small (the exceptions are pretty much just synchronizing on a brand new machine from the genesis block).\n\n\nThat is invoking trust. If you invoke trust in the wrong set of people then you are permanently isolated.\n\n>An attacker who has isolated your network connection can also feed you a fake PoW blockchain at some economic cost. If they prevent you from seeing the real chain (with the larger accumulated work), you will believe the chain they gave you is real and could be vulnerable to a double spend attack. The question is: does the economic cost to the attacker for producing that fake chain exceed the double spend gain? If so, it is not rational for the attacker to do this attack.\n\nYou can add peers with Bitcoin as well. With Bitcoin you need to have one honest person give you information. With Bitshares, you need to choose a set of people to trust and if they\'re wrong you are wrong and have no way of knowing (since you are inherently distrusting people who disagree with them by design of the system).\n\n>But here is the important thing. Since the chain you were on was a majority consensus chain from your perspective but yet turned out to be a fake chain, it necessarily means that some of the delegates double-signed blocks. And since you received that chain, you have in your possession the cryptographic proof to get all 91 of those double-signing delegates fired by simply submitting that proof to the network once your internet connection is no longer isolated. If you get the delegate fired, you hurt them economically. As long the economic harm you cause them is greater than the double spend gain they can potentially get, you don\'t realistically need to worry about such an attack in the first place just like you don\'t with Bitcoin.\n\nYou are implying the only people who can make forks are current delegates AND that the benefit of an attack can\'t outweigh the costs. \n\n>So let\'s compare security between the two models. People say 6 confirmations (estimated to be 1 hour) in Bitcoin is enough security. Considering the block reward is 25 BTC and competition drives down mining profits to 0%, we can assume the cost of producing the 6 fake blocks to double-spend attack you is (6 blocks)*(25 BTC/block)*($318/BTC) = $47,700 (with the current market price of BTC). Keep in mind that the attackers can double-spend as many victims as they can simultaneously isolate (isolate their network connection from the rest of the world) for this fixed cost of $47,700.\n\nWell... that\'s a wrong assumption. You aren\'t understanding how blocks are created. Unlike Bitshares where you know exactly who will make a block and can coordinate a collusion between 6 entities or 6% of the network, Bitcoin has no guarantee of making a block in a certain order. Assuming the largest entity that could force a large reorg has 10% of the network hashrate, they would only succeed [0.024% of the time](https://people.xiph.org/~greg/attack_success.html), costing them (6 blocks)*(25 BTC/block)*($318/BTC) * (~4100 tries) = $195,570,000. Yes, there are mining pools that have more than 10%, but their miners software will change pools if they detect a reorg attempt.\n\n>In DPOS, if 51 unique delegates (of the 101 total active delegates) confirm a block (which at a block interval of 10 seconds is estimated to take anywhere from 8 to 16 minutes before you have at least all 51), you "know" you are on the majority consensus chain. What is the cost to these delegates for creating the fake blockchain? Well if they double-sign a block in a given round (a 16 minute time period) they will be fired and will not receive and further delegate pay. So their cost is their opportunity cost: all of the income they would have received if they had behaved honestly.\n\nAnd when you aren\'t a delegate, the income you would generate from behaving honestly is $0. The rest of your post seems to be based around the lack of understanding of the NaS problem and the assumption that the only people who can create forks are current delegates or current stakeholders. Because of the way a blockchain works, time is subjective and can be forged. A fork using historical delegate private keys or historical stake can be made and unless there is some **centralized** checkpointing mechanism, or some consensus breaking mechanism (like not accepting reorgs) then this fork will be recognized as valid by the network.': 3, 'Yes it is. Creating forks is free in DPoS and that makes it susceptible to NaS no matter how much the BitShares echo chamber denies it.': -3, 'The blog the OP is written on has the white paper for market pegged assets as well.': 3, "> That is invoking trust. If you invoke trust in the wrong set of people then you are permanently isolated.\n\nWell, you definitely are not permanently isolated.

My internet connection is compromised. I download the compromised software fed by my attacker. I audit all of the code (because I sure can't trust third-parties to do it for me because they could be attacking me). I don't know if the checkpoint is correct (or the genesis block for that matter). I ask my friend (who is in on the conspiracy) who has already been using the software for a while to provide me with a recent checkpoint. I use an exchange to buy some of the tokens using my hard earned cash (a small amount for now). I go to spend some of that money at my local supermarket (who is also in on the conspiracy). Finally, I feel confident enough that I am on the correct chain that I can now spend lots of money on the (once again compromised) exchange buying up more coins. But oh wait, now that the attackers got my money they finally allow me to connect to the uncompromised internet and realize I was on the wrong chain this whole time! \n\nIt's ridiculous.\n\nRemember short-range nothing-at-stake problems are solved by DPOS and some other PoS coins by penalizing double-signers.\n\n> You can add peers with Bitcoin as well. With Bitcoin you need to have one honest person give you information. With Bitshares, you need to choose a set of people to trust and if they're wrong you are wrong and have no way of knowing (since you are inherently distrusting people who disagree with them by design of the system).\n\nI think you are confusing two issues here. I was talking about the problem of attacking someone by isolating their internet access (in which case no one with the true blockchain could get through the attacker's firewall). If you have unrestricted internet access then again all it takes is one honest party to feed you the true chain for you to realize in less than 16 minutes that some delegates are trying to trick you (so you don't give them the good/service in exchange for the possibly worthless, since it could be a double-spend, coins).\n\n> You are implying the only people who can make forks are current delegates AND that the benefit of an attack can't outweigh the costs.\n\nThe only people who can make forks are current delegates because you know who the top 101 delegates are and those are the only ones who can produce blocks. If you want to break that assumption then you are either implying a long-range stake attack (which I already addressed) or a 51% stake attack which is *way* more expensive to do than a 51% hash power attack on Bitcoin.\n\n> Well... that's a wrong assumption. You aren't understanding how blocks are created. Unlike Bitshares where you know exactly who will make a block and can coordinate a collusion between 6 entities or 6% of the network, Bitcoin has no guarantee of making a block in a certain order. Assuming the largest entity that could force a large reorg has 10% of the network hashrate, they would only succeed 0.024% of the time, costing them (6 blocks)(25 BTC/block)($318/BTC) * (~4100 tries) = $195,570,000. Yes, there are mining pools that have more than 10%, but their miners software will change pools if they detect a reorg attempt.\n\nAh, you are right, I made a mistake (I will have to fix that). I completely neglected that. I apologize. However, that doesn't change the overall concept. So, let's assume the attacker has 10% of the network hashrate. ~~In that case, with the 2 week opportunity cost assumption, the security of DPOS would be $4,182,000/$195,570,000 = 2% that of PoW for this particular attack scenario.~~ Actually, no wait this isn't correct. A more proper economic analysis is necessary. The investment cost of the mining equipment can be spread over all the attempts. The only cost per attempt is the electricity cost which is a fraction of the total mining cost. I don't have time to do this analysis properly today. Anyway, we know that $195,570,000 would be an upper bound on it.\n\nWhile that isn't great, remember that this is an attack scenario where the attacker has both completely compromised the victim's internet connection. If the victims have an uncompromised internet access, they will detect the double-signed blocks in less than 16 minutes (less than two Bitcoin confirmations).\n\nAlso, in my second example with the opportunity cost being 1 full year, the security provided by DPOS ($213,282,000) is greater than the security provided by PoW ($195,570,000). You have to realize that most delegates will be giving up their real identities. They cannot just try to carry out an attack, throw away their fake identity when they get caught, and do it again for another two weeks worth of pay for the registration cost. Once they are out for double-signing, they are out for good. Another set of at least 51 colluding individuals would have to convince the stakeholders that they are honest delegates in order to get voted in and try to repeat an attack.\n\n> And when you aren't a delegate, the income you would generate from behaving honestly is $0. The rest of your post seems to be based around the lack of understanding of the NaS problem and the assumption that the only people who can create forks are current delegates or current stakeholders. Because of the way a blockchain works, time is subjective and can be forged. A fork using historical delegate private keys or historical stake can be made and unless there is some centralized checkpointing mechanism, or some consensus breaking mechanism (like not accepting reorgs) then this fork will be recognized as valid by the network.\n\nI understand NaS. Most of my post was not addressing long-range nothing-at-stake (just the first paragraph), which is what you are talking about. By the time an attacker can buy control of private keys of old delegates or old stakeholders enough time would have passed that the blockchain would not reorganize to another chain with a fork point starting that far in the past. \n\nIf the client is starting from genesis, they would need  a more recent checkpoint (at most 6 months old should be fine). The checkpoint does not have to be centralized. I already discussed that in the first paragraph of my previous post and the first two paragraphs of this post.\n\n": 1, '> And former stakeholders who vote for them.\n\nThis is the long-range nothing-at-stake problem which is solved with checkpoints. Checkpoints aren\'t a problem once you embrace [weak subjectivity](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/11/25/proof-stake-learned-love-weak-subjectivity/) and realize the checkpoints only practically matter to clients synchronizing with the network after a long period (several months) of being offline. Checkpoints are also not a centralization risk because you don\'t need to trust the developers for the validity of the checkpoints. You can ask anyone who has a stored recent copy of the blockchain. Ask enough people unlikely to collude together, and you can be very confident it is the "correct" one. And once again you hardly ever have to do this since your synchronization period will usually be quite small (the exceptions are pretty much just synchronizing on a brand new machine from the genesis block).\n\n\n> This is ignoring basic info theory. You don\'t have access to all data in the world and you don\'t need to make forks public.\n\nAn attacker who has isolated your network connection can also feed you a fake PoW blockchain at some economic cost. If they prevent you from seeing the real chain (with the larger accumulated work), you will believe the chain they gave you is real and could be vulnerable to a double spend attack. The question is: does the economic cost to the attacker for producing that fake chain exceed the double spend gain? If so, it is not rational for the attacker to do this attack.\n\nIn DPOS, if 91 delegates collude and isolate your network, they can provide you with a fake chain and double-spend attack you. Even after 16 minutes after you first "received" the transaction, you will still believe you are on the right chain with >90% delegate participation, at least until your network is no longer isolated and you eventually discover you were on a fork. At that point the fork resolution mechanics come in to play and probably the other fork will win (and you will have lost money due to the realized double-spend) since the other fork will probably have more than 91 delegates signing the chain.\n\nBut here is the important thing. Since the chain you were on was a majority consensus chain from your perspective but yet turned out to be a fake chain, it necessarily means that some of the delegates double-signed blocks. And since you received that chain, you have in your possession the cryptographic proof to get all 91 of those double-signing delegates fired by simply submitting that proof to the network once your internet connection is no longer isolated. If you get the delegate fired, you hurt them economically. As long the economic harm you cause them is greater than the double spend gain they can potentially get, you don\'t realistically need to worry about such an attack in the first place just like you don\'t with Bitcoin.\n\nSo let\'s compare security between the two models. People say 6 confirmations (estimated to be 1 hour) in Bitcoin is enough security. Considering the block reward is 25 BTC and competition drives down mining profits to 0%, we can assume the cost of producing the 6 fake blocks for a double-spend attack is ~~(6 blocks)\\*(25 BTC/block)\\*($318/BTC) = $47,700~~ (with the current market price of BTC). Keep in mind that the attackers can double-spend as many victims as they can simultaneously isolate (isolate their network connection from the rest of the world) for this fixed cost ~~of $47,700~~. **Edit: There is a mistake with this calculation. The actual analysis is more complicated than this (thanks to 110101002 for pointing it out) and requires further assumptions. I don\'t have to time right now to do the analysis properly, but just read the comments below in this thread to learn more.**\n\nIn DPOS, if 51 unique delegates (of the 101 total active delegates) confirm a block (which at a block interval of 10 seconds is estimated to take anywhere from 8 to 16 minutes before you have at least all 51), you "know" you are on the majority consensus chain. What is the cost to these delegates for creating the fake blockchain? Well if they double-sign a block in a given round (a 16 minute time period) they will be fired and will not receive and further delegate pay. So their cost is their opportunity cost: all of the income they would have received if they had behaved honestly. \n\nHow much is this income? Well let us estimate it fairly by comparing what it could be if BTC were to adopt this. So I will use the same inflation rate as BTC (approximately 10% per year) and the market cap of BTC ($4.3 billion). If BitShares (BTS) had a market cap of $4.3 billion and was inflating at 10% per year, it would be able to pay delegates $430 million per year. Since there are 101 delegates, that means each delegate could get paid $4.25 million per year (or $164,000 every 2 weeks). \n\nA delegate needs to pay two weeks reward to register. Let\'s assume an attacker registers 51 evil delegates (paying a total of $8,364,000), *somehow* tricks the BTS stakeholders to vote them all in, and then tries to double-sign a block (in order to double-spend attack people) immediately after getting them all voted into the top 101. If any one of those victims sends the double spend proof to the network (which they will once they realize they have been attacked), all 51 of those delegates will be fired and no longer be able to receive block rewards. So the question to ask is how long will it take before a double-spend victim is able to connect to the rest of the internet, realize they have been attacked, and send the double-sign proof to the network? Also, how long will it take for the clients of stakeholders to come online detect the double-sign proof and (automatically) update their votes to vote that delegate out? I would say we can estimate 1 day for the victim to get back online and 6 days for enough stakeholders to launch their client, detect the double-sign proof, and vote the evil delegates out. Since the evil delegates will continue earning block rewards during that estimated 1 week, the net loss (not accounting for any double-spend gains) will actually be $4,182,000 (~~which is still orders of magnitude greater than the $47,700 loss from the PoW model~~). ~~**What my analysis shows is that security provided by DPOS is at least 87 times better than PoW given the same cost paid for the security**~~ (at least with the assumptions given in this paragraph).\n\nWhat if the delegate waits longer than two weeks before attacking? One answer to this is that by that point the delegate has earned the trust of the stakeholders and they could make more money just remaining an honest delegate rather than double-spend attacking innocent people (which is guaranteed to get them fired, probably in less than a week, and lose all that potential future income). The other answer is that we could allow a delegate to retire and take back their registration fee (so their registration fee is actually more of a security deposit). Obviously, they would lose their deposit if a double-sign proof is submitted to the blockchain. By requiring a 2 week waiting period after retirement before the delegate can get their security deposit back, we can be very confident that any victims have submitted any valid double-spend proofs by then. ~~With this minor tweak, we design the economics of the system to pretty much guarantee that the minimum 87x better security per fixed cost of DPOS over PoW remains true in all cases (even when the delegate wants to quit or knows will be voted out soon AND also doesn\'t care about their reputation going forward).~~\n\nHowever, the security is often much better ~~than 87x~~. If the opportunity cost for a delegate that double-signs a block is not just 2 weeks pay but rather a full year\'s pay (meaning the delegate could have easily stayed elected and gotten paid for producing blocks for at least a year if they did not double-sign blocks), then the security can improve by more than an order of magnitude. Once again I assume the delays of submitting the double-spend proof and clients reacting to it by voting the delegate out takes approximately 1 week. Then the remaining 51 weeks of pay will be lost to the delegate. Using the numbers of the previous example, this would correspond to a pay of $213,282,000 (~~4471x improvement in security over PoW~~). \n\nIt is clear that this amount of security is overkill. ~~So what we can do instead is reduce the amount we pay for security. With just 2x improvement in security per unit cost over PoW, DPOS can afford an inflation rate that is 43.5 times smaller (0.23% instead of 10%). We could even keep the remaining 9.77% inflation if we want and instead use it to pay for *actual productive work* not just burning electricity. Again at BTC\'s market cap, that would correspond to a total payment stream of $420,110,000 per year. $110,000 per year could pay the server costs of the 101 delegates (a little more than $1000/year each) for the low transaction volume Bitcoin currently needs to handle. Even as more powerful computers are needed to scale with the transaction volume, $20 million of the $420 million could probably take care of it. This leaves more than $400 million per year that could be spent on productive things like development, marketing, legal costs, etc. Or that money could just be destroyed to reduce the inflation to below 1%. And that isn\'t even counting any of the transaction fees that could be burned to make the inflation rate negative (meaning BTS could experience *monetary deflation* while still remaining secure).~~\n\nEdit: The security is still overkill IMO despite the change in the numbers. It\'s not worth wasting $420 million per year to improve security against double spend attacks in the unlikely case where the majority of stakeholder-elected delegates collude to attack users AND completely control the victim\'s internet access.': 3, 'Yes, I have the same concerns.

This is because so many people are headed to their homes in the rural areas.  Transport home for most occurs on a combination of buses (and "matatus") so carrying cash is risky.   What many do is deposit cash into M-Pesa before traveling, then withdrawing from an agent in the rural area. \n\nThe agents can only accept cash deposit if they still have "float" (i.e., a positive balance on their M-Pesa agent account).  By today, many of the agents in the larger cities are completely out of float and thus cannot accept additional cash deposits.    In the rural areas, the M-Pesa agents are reporting the opposite -- they have seen so many withdrawals (by the arriving travelers) that they have no more cash to hand out.\n\nSo Bitcoin has a place in being a direct competitor for the basic cash-in cash-out (CICO) transactions that are the vast majority of M-Pesa transactions.  Because M-Pesa fees are not insignificant there\'s an opportunity for Bitcoin to compete on that front.

': 5, '> You don\'t have a desktop or laptop PC. \n\nUnlikely.\n\n> You could maybe store your bitcoins on a mobile phone?\n\nRight. So the statistics are pretty interesting on this. Both feature phone and smartphone penetration rates are exploding in Africa. And there\'s sign of this trend accelerating, as we\'ve see technology prices drop hard. For example, in 2012 around this time of year, we saw cheap smartphones (with 3g, Android, google maps, youtube, facebook etc) retail at $50 in Kenya. This year, we\'ve seen reports of a similar $20 smartphone hit the market. And this is retail price. Imagine what the 2nd hand and refurbished price will be for those things next year, probably $10-15. By 2020, you\'ll be able to get cheap tech like this for next to nothing. Hell, a single individual, Bill Gates, could literally buy just about every non-phone owning person today, a smartphone, and still have a few billion left, to put things into perspective. This is becoming cheap accessible tech.\n\nSo that\'s the consumer hardware. That\'s all great, but we still need connectivity.\n\nMeanwhile, we\'ve also seen large experiments in networking technology. From Google\'s wifi balloons circling the earth to Facebook\'s internet.org projects to bring low-data connectivity for free. These are just the first forays into networking for all. The key point is to get connectivity out there, getting good speed or nice bandwidth isn\'t crucial. You just need some connectivity and you can do basic things.\n\nWhen I say \'basic things\', let me put it into perspective: an hour of watching some TV show on Netflix is 1 gigabyte of bandwidth. That\'s the same amount of data as roughly 1.25 million bitcoin transactions or so. An average person makes about 2 transactions a day. So while I watch a movie for 2 hours, I use enough bandwidth to power the transaction volume of a city of 1 million for an entire day. In other words, it\'s really cheap to supply the bandwidth to do basic things like send a bitcoin transaction. If we can get a single Netflix-capable connection in every city of millions, you\'ve got enough. By 2020, I don\'t think that will be such a tall order. Nielsen\'s law applies here on a macro-level. (50% improvements to internet speed per year). By decade\'s end we\'ll have more than an order of magnitude more network capability, these things move fast, too. Again, for perspective, a single bitcoin transaction averages about 500 bytes, my $40 internet connection at home consistently gets 70 mbit, or 18k transactions per second. In other words, I could power all transactions for an entire city of 1 million for an entire day in less than 2 minutes of my bandwidth. If I can do that today for $50, and if network speeds follow Nielsen\'s law (11x in 6 years), I think we can manage to offer 1 millionth of a fraction of my home connection to each person in an African city in 6 years from now. (hell that\'s been possible for years, I just skyped my dad in Africa and he\'s got a similar connection like me!). Just saying that it could be free for anyone, like how anyone can just pick up a radio signal for free and you don\'t even think about it.\n\nSo I think it\'s quite feasible to say that by 2020 a lot of the poor and unconnected people today, will have access to the same computing power we did with the first iPhone, and free connectivity to do basic things like sending transactions around.\n\nOf course it doesn\'t have to be smart phones and internet. We don\'t know yet what it would look like. Bitcoin at its core works using cryptography, and that uses private and public keys. These private keys are just small bits of data, like a single sentence. *"this sentence could be a private key"* My point is, you could have a system where money is stored on paper wallets (like many of us do, today). Nobody actually needs to own a phone, only the merchant does. So a company might pay its employees in paper wallets, and people could go to a local store, scan their paper wallet (which has a change-address on it, too, which is a paper wallet stored at home or at a local custodian), and pay that way, like cash. Only the store owner would need a $10 phone to scan these things, with a free app, and only the store owner would need some basic connectivity to make the transaction.\n\nOr we might see an NFC chip wallet, basically a cheap $1 piece of plastic that holds a chip with your private key. You keep it close to the merchant\'s phone, and the payment completes. And you can go to any merchant and load it up with money, just like MPesa works today with feature phones. Hell, you could do a bitcoin wallet on a feature phone (it\'s not very user-friendly, but it\'s been done already. Problem is most feature phone UIs require permission from the carrier, so it\'s been hard to get one to market, but they\'ve been developed and work). You could also do SMS based wallets on feature phones which are cheap, ubiquitous, and (intermittent) connectivity is very comprehensive, they already exist, Coinbase has an SMS based wallet for example. My point is, bitcoin works with private keys and low-data transactions. The computation involved in signing a transaction is next to nothing, a 10 year old nokia\'s chip could easily do it, and the data involved is very small, examples above. If you wanted, you could literally run a bitcoin economy through Radio, Morse code or delivery by pigeon. It doesn\'t matter.\n\nAnyway, the above story really is just one on technical feasibility. In that area I think bitcoin sits very comfortably. But bitcoin in Africa is still a bit of a pipe dream the coming years. Enough tech and connectivity is already there for hundreds of millions, not everyone but still a shit ton of people equaling say the population of the US or South America. But you also need good entrepreneurs, you need investments, you need to shift cultures, and you need to combine this with a deep integrated financial market. We can all do merchant payments at Microsoft today because MS lets Bitpay sell coins at one of a dozen professional exchanges with decent liquidity pools in multiple currencies. That financial market is crucial. We got to it because there was real consumer demand to trade bitcoin, and miners who were looking to sell bitcoin in those same currencies. So you have this whole integrated ecosystem. In Africa, you don\'t have much mining done, so the only bitcoin there comes from people who want to buy e.g. Nigerian Nairas. And there\'s very little of that. So there is no liquidity in Africa. That means you don\'t get a market there, you don\'t get exchanges there, you don\'t get merchants accepting bitcoin there for fiat payouts. That means no VCs invest there, no ATMs exist there etc. Most of all, there\'s nothing attracting African entrepreneurs to bitcoin. That\'s why getting an ecosystem up and running in Africa is so hard, and so slow, not because people don\'t have phones or whatever, that\'s not really the problem. It will happen, but it\'ll be slow. The biggest thing imo that needs to be done right now, is get entrepreneurs into African remittance. That\'s the one area I think that shows a real customer need, that bitcoin can actually do better, and that creates bitcoin liquidity in the continent, as say Europeans with easy access to bitcoin send it to Africa where its sold locally so that their relatives can get a fiat payout. BitPesa is doing great work in this, they\'re one of the most exciting things to follow for me in 2015, really hope they can show decent growth next year as they roll out the product.\n\nIn terms of security, I don\'t think there\'s anything particularly unique here. Storing bitcoin on a phone or paper wallet will not be less secure than doing so in e.g. Europe, generally. Of all things this is probably a minor issue as it\'s likely quite similar to the rest of the world.\n\nLanguage and education also isn\'t really an issue. It\'s not trivial, but MPesa shows it\'s just an obstacle to overcome, not something that makes it impossible.\n\nVolatility also isn\'t really a big issue I think. Long-term, we\'ll have an investor class and a consumer class. The consumers will simply buy derivatives from the investors. The investors carry the risks and the profits of the price of bitcoin moving around and being volatile. The consumers will get a steady price with no volatility. Coinapult Locks and Bitreserve already offer this. So you can lock the price of your bitcoin and use it for payments like a normal currency, without risk of volatility. This will be how mainstream consumers will use bitcoin. In fact, at some point they might not even own bitcoin, they\'ll just have a digital version of their national currency, powered by bitcoin without them knowing anything about it. Just like how your creditcard is essentially a digital payment of your national currency, without you having to know anything about underlying creditcard technology. Bitcoin can work similarly by powering a financial system where its users don\'t know anything about the tech. Yet, it\'s still open to anyone who wants to hold and use it directly.\n\ntl;dr Really the biggest problem to me is that it\'ll be slow because it\'s really hard to get an integrated ecosystem going, starting with liquidity. It\'s no use creating tech, connectivity, wallets, education etc, if nobody can get their hands on bitcoin. It\'s like creating a beautiful kitchen in an area where the crops failed. Liquidity is the first step, entrepreneurs will follow.\n': 25, 'You are a poor African villager, how would you get a bitcoin in the first place?

It is totally insufficieent to explain the ~60% price drop in 2014.  The drop is due to speculation, namely lowered expectations about future prices; which induces people to ask and bid at lower prices.\n\n(2) On the other hand, the effect of those coins on the price is pretty much the same, no matter what the miners do with them.  If they are sold off-exchange, they are filling a demand that would otherwise have to be satisfied by buying somewhere else.  Even if that alternative source was off-exchange too, the same reasoning would apply.  Ultimately that unfilled demand would have been filled from the exchanges.  So, even if they are sold off-exchange, they are indirectly reducing demand on the exchanges.\n\nThat reduction of demand happens even if a miner Joe keeps 60% (say) of the coins that he mines.

If you sell all the bitcoin production at let's say 300$ per BTC, you'll get **900,000$** per month. That makes a profit of 100,000$ per month (before taxes).\n\nWhen the reward halving arrives, with the same hashing power you have, the BTC output of your miners will be HALF of that. So still 4 blocks per day, but that's only 50 BTC per day, 1.500 BTC per month = **450,000$** per month.

Quickly realized it was cheaper to buy on the their "market" than from their storefront. Also another alt coin I had mined before switched algos and I was able to mine a bunch early to buy cheaper Zen Hashlets. Bought most in mid October. So about 2 months I was doing decently, easily a few bucks a day. Noticed past few days the price of these hashlets is diving and now the "genesis" ones seem to be the only profitable ones if you already have money in there or hashlet to trade.  \n\nI became suspicious when they kept promising lower maintenance fees and they haven\'t decreased even as payouts have plummeted. A Zen hashlet right now has a 99.99% fee right now based on current numbers. A Genesis hashlet on their site right now has a 48.9% fee based on current numbers. They can lower the fees with a mouse click but why haven\'t they?\n\nI\'ve moved most of my money on ZenCloud into Genesis hashlets for now. I have some in Paycoin only because they converted hashpoints and let users turn some Zens into hashstakers. \n\nLong winded rambling aside, I see what\'s happening. The 1 satoshi is technically "profit" so they\'re "always profitable." But even at market lows you can see a Zen for a couple bucks, dump it into a Genesis or cash it out and hold as BTC and probably make more. According to my math each Zen makes 0.06 USD a day now. After .08 USD fees, that\'s -0.02 cents a day. And the 1 satoshi cancels that out but still, why won\'t they lower fees to increase profits? From their end it seems that would draw more buyers in anyways.\n\nIn any event I mine in other ways and hold other coins. I maybe dropped a few hundred into GAW ZenCloud and maybe lost 50-75 bucks when all is said and done if I bailed it all now. But I can\'t imagine those that dumped thousands into Zens after October and suddenly are really stuck in the red.
