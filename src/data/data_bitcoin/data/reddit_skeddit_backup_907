The fact that mining difficulty has historically risen over time represents two things:\n\n- Improvements in mining technology (first it was CPUs, then GPUs, now it's ASICs and the chips continue to become faster and more efficient each generation).\n- Increased investment in mining operations:  No matter how much is invested in mining, there is always a fixed amount of coins to be mined, so the more that gets invested just pushes up the cost of production for making blocks.\n\nPeople often make the mistake of thinking that increasing mining difficulty causes miners to have to invest more to find blocks.  That's backwards - it's actually *because* miners choose to invest more in their operations that difficulty keeps growing.\n\nAlso, you're completely overlooking that Bitcoin is a currency.

I think it\'s unlikely, but I definitely know it\'s possible.\n* It doesn\'t collapse if exponential investment does not continue.  The price might not continue increasing exponentially if adoption slows, but it won\'t fall to zero as there\'s actually an ecosystem and economy behind it, and not just returns unsustainably paid up the pyramid.\n* It actually works, you really can transfer a million dollars for 5 cents to anyone anywhere in the world.

Subjects were required to meet DSM-IV-R criteria for the diagnosis of crime or war-related chronic PTSD, and to have treatment-resistant symptoms, defined as a CAPS score of \xf4\x8f\xb0\x8450 (signifying moderate to severe symptoms) following at least 3 months of prior SSRI or serotonin\xe2\x80\x93norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) treatment in addition to at least 6 months of psycho- therapy. Exclusion criteria required freedom from any major medical conditions. In addition, psychiatric exclusion criteria included Borderline Personality Disorder or any current Axis I disorder with the following exceptions which were allowed: anxiety disorders, affective disorders other than bipolar dis- order type 1, substance abuse or dependence in remission for \xf4\x8f\xb0\x8460 days, and eating disorder without active purging. Urine drug testing for cocaine, marijuana, amphetamines, MDMA, opiates and benzodiazepines was performed during initial screening and immediately before each experimental session.
