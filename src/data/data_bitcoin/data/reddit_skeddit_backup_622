It needs to exist without specialized requirements or extra work to accomplish.  If anything a slightly higher fee would be acceptable, but for bitcoin to succeed, it absolutely has to integrate features which provide anonymity, and not just "if you want it."

For them to bear the risk of seeing their money (and directly their livelihood) drop by a factor of two or three or even four, or lose their money when they make a human mistake (data entry mistakes that even rocket scientists make) for the sake of challenging the banking system isn't just naive but it's also wrong. That's the type of people Gates is talking about here, not you and me.\n\nThe currency you describe would definitely be interesting but so far I've not seen technical proposals. Yes you can generate supply on a benchmark of some basket of goods, but how do you revoke supply when the benchmark goes the other way? And how do you calculate the basket of goods in a place where the gray (unaccounted) market is bigger than the accounted market, where the data doesn't even exist. Let alone the issue of corruption and manipulation, even if your protocol finds datasets on prices and trade, how do you verify it's not manipulated? Using a central backer would just introduce either a government or a body that the government could exert pressure on, regulate and control. \n\nIn any case I agree it's an imperfect system. My point is not that there's a solution out there today that is both extremely consumer friendly as well as extremely politically neutral and fair. Rather my point was that where Gates is a fan of Mpesa, I've described a system built on parts that have already been built and function today, that is safer, less volatile, cheaper and with the same oversights as Mpesa, which utilizes bitcoin. It's not supposed to be a perfect proposal without problems, rather its a proposal that is 'merely' better than Mpesa, an invention that powers the vast majority of Kenya's transactions today, using bitcoin. And that's pretty cool.": 1, 'Well, on the other hand Bill Gates is still on the Microsoft board, and Microsoft accepts Bitcoin in the Windows and Xbox stores. ': 8, "Betterthancash isn't incompatible with bitcoin?\n\nFor example Gates is a huge fan of Mpesa. Guess what, Kipochi built a bitcoin wallet like Mpesa (that interfaced with Mpesa, too) and it worked great and was a lot cheaper than Mpesa (it's about $0.6 to send $6 on Mpesa for example). And if they combined that with the open Bitreserve API, Kenyans could've been using a cheaper mobile wallet than Mpesa (on the bitcoin network) and a more stable currency (dollar or euro or gold-pegged bitcoins on Bitreserve).\n\nThe carrier shut down that wallet and they never did integrate with Bitreserve. But what I just described is possible today, not only that but its individual parts were already built and functioning. And it's better than Mpesa in every single way. Yet it'd still afford control and regulatory scrutiny to the carrier, kipochi and bitreserve all of whom abide by their respective legal systems.\n\nGates would love something like that, no doubt. He's not anti-bitcoin, he appreciates it, his legacy company on which he is still an adviser to the most senior staff uses it and plans to expand it. \n\nBut he's also a guy who isn't keen on bringing a speculative asset like bitcoin to the poorest people on the planet with no regulatory oversight. And you can't fault him for that, I wouldn't either. (the first bit at least)\n\nThat's not to say he doesn't like the protocol, but that he wants people to use bitcoin through companies that have consumer protections and oversight. And the example above has all of that: protections, oversight, no volatility, and it's much better (cheaper) than Mpesa. And what's more, not limited to Kenya in any way and applicable worldwide. Gates would absolutely support something like that if he was fully aware of the implications.\n\nDoes that mean Gates and the rest of the world will jump on the bitcoin bandwagon with two feet tomorrow? No, but we can easily see perceptions shifting from just 2-3 years ago when people would laugh at the idea of Microsoft accepting bitcoin or Gates talking about a 'bitcoin revolution'.": 9, 'And it is not Bitcoin???!!\nHE forget to invest in Bitcoin / Bitcoin companies so now he is a bit disappointed.\n': 4, "It isn't anonymous at all really.": 3, 'If Bill Gates implements Bitcoin it will be huge.

Basically every country could have it's own companies who operate like bitreserve. Transaction inside each system can be very cheap and many different services can be build on top of this.\n\nThe power of bitcoin comes into play if you want to transfer value between different systems. For example, it makes it possible to send value from my bitreserve account to PayPall account for zero to low fees. The only thing a service needs to do is to be able to accept bitcoins, and upon receiving, turn them into the account currency preference. If money needs to leave the system of the service provider, they just need to supply the option to send trough bitcoin. This service provider can be anyone you want, banks, paypall, MPessa. They only need to support PayBy and Receiving Bitcoin and they are linked to the global network.\n\n- If you want to switch providers? Just send all value in the account to the other provider supporting bitcoin.\n- Need stability? No problem because no money is kept in bitcoin, only transferred trough bitcoin if it leaves the service provider.\n- Government Regulation?

The reason for a statement like this is probably misinformation. He might even be right. But it's a moot point. Reversal of transactions ATM requires a trusted third party, which means that centralization is the most efficient way to do that. For that, solutions already exist. If people like Gates think that this is an important part of the system, then they need to understand that they are proposing a problem that is not solved by BTC and is solved very easily by banks, mastercard, visa, and their contemporaries. That said, with smart contracts being built into platforms like Counterparty, there may be a way in the future to do transaction reversals without that third party. And that functionality is built on the blockchain. Moreover, if he's concerned about BTC volatility, it means that what Gates doesn't know yet is that the Blockchain is currency agnostic. While BTC is the current currency of the blockchain, it probably doesn't always have to be, and using tokenization on the blockchain, a person can basically trade USD, Reals, Rubles, whatever currency they want. They could even trade currency baskets on the blockchain. I'd be willing to bet that Ripple's functionalities will all be built on the BTC blockchain in the not so distant future. So, while I applaud Gates for dipping his feet in the miry waters of Bitcoin, I don't think he's leveled up enough to be making declarations about the state of Bitcoin quite yet.": 12, 'Partly true, except you are only one of the very few that uses OSX.

If you feel the need to trust a third party, you involve an escrow service and/or use multisig, same as today.\n\nI would expect more from Bill Gates. Moving on...": 9, 'volatility isnt a concern if you dont want it to be. there is no reason you cant just implement a bitpay like system end to end where both users send fiat but the mechanism used is the bitcoin protocol. The fees however would obviously be a a bit higher - probably in the neighborhood of 2-3% though.': 2, "I think that's quite a fair assessment: not everyone will want to use a non-reversible 'you fuck up, you're outa luck' system. And that's okay. And it's completely compatible with an economy built on top of the bitcoin protocol. Note that things like reversible transactions can be built on top of bitcoin. Just look at Changetip, they could reverse tips anytime they want, for example, but it's still built on top of bitcoin.\n\nSame with volatility. Well for one, let's ignore the first few years of 50%, 25%, and today around 11% inflation, with no regulatory certainty in various countries, a fast growing ecosystem etc. You can't speak on long-term volatility by taking samples from the situation I just described. But if we look at inflation it's set to be near zero within a few decades while completely predictable, it's volatility will likely be a lot better than the vast majority of currencies out there that are crap. (I'm only comfortable holding maybe 10ish currencies? Most are quite bad). So already this is a step up for the majority of the world's population. But more importantly, we are already seeing companies like Bitreserve that offer financial services of sending and receiving money using bitcoin but without the volatility of bitcoin. You simply keep your money in dollars or euros or gold. It means you can get digital money, mobile money, to anyone, powered by bitcoin with the volatility of stable dominant currencies, and the speed and low fees of bitcoin using its network.\n\nIn other words, when Bill Gates says 'bitcoin alone is not enough' I agree. Just like 'TCP/IP' is not enough. You actually need companies that e.g. build a freaking browser like Firefox to even browse the web over TCP/IP, Skype to videoconference/call over TCP/IP, Email clients like Gmail to read email data over TCP/IP (and its email protocols) etc. The protocol is not enough. But that doesn't mean the protocol is not part of the solution.\n\nIn other words it seems to me Bill Gates is quite right and in saying 'we need to draw on the revolution of Bitcoin' I see him open to the idea that the bitcoin protocol will power many of the services and businesses that we will also need to get financial services to billions of people.\n\nGood stuff.": 41, "Ask the people in Russia if they've felt the effects of their latest rapid 50% devaluation and how positive it's been for them.": 4, 'I stand corrected.\n\n100 bits /u/changetip private': 9, "Bitcoin alone ISN'T good enough.

": 6, "Even fiat doesn't solve what he's concerned with. Fiat is volatile too, especially these days. It just seems reasonably stable because everything is priced in fiat.\n\nIronically bitcoin can be very stable but it requires a  change in thinking about what is coming as bitcoin matures. Consider that the whole time the dollar price of bitcoin has been so volatile, the actual number of bitcoin anyone holds hasn't changed. If I hold 5 bitcoin I still have 5 bitcoin tomorrow despite any volatility in the fiat pricing world. What I'm saying is the current bitcoin volatility is a reflection of pricing in dollars. As bitcoin matures, becomes used globally,  and more importantly becomes the source of pricing rather than dozens of fiats suddenly it won't be bitcoin that is volatile. A bitcoin is a bitcoin and how many will exist is known--this is practically the definition of stability and is a huge contrast to fiat where billions are created in QE programs in various  countries and value is always being managed down. Bitcoin has the capability of being extremely stable compared to fiat, but it needs to grow more and take on it's own pricing. What I think is coming eventually is fiat will be priced against bitcoin, not the other way around and bitcoin will become stable as a rock by comparison.
