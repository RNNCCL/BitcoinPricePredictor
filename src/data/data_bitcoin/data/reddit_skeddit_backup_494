Bitcoin additionally makes the data public and distributed, allowing anyone to add data and make the blocks secure.  It also is designed to operate without a trusted third party.  But those features are optional. You can design other forms of data storage with varying numbers of parties allowed to add data, access the data, level of centralization vs. distribution etc.\n\nBy comparison, the bittorent protocol uses SHA1 hashes of the "pieces" of the data as checksums, to verify each piece was transferred correctly.  But the metadata (.torrent file) containing these hashes isn\'t itself secured.  So a malicious person could change the contents of the data, and the corresponding hash, and deliver altered data.  Chaining data blocks (or pieces) by including the hash of one block as data in the next makes this sort of tampering harder.  It also places the data in sequence, which is useful for things like data logs, ledgers, or record-keeping systems.\n\nYou can increase the security against tampering or data corruption by adding a random number to each block, and requiring the hash result to meet a test.  Bitcoin does this because it is a public, distributed system involving financial transactions.  The incentive for tampering is thus high, and so is the opportunity, because anyone can participate in the Bitcoin network.  The difficulty of tampering therefore also has to be high, so as to keep it a minor risk.\n\nBut in other applications with different risk profiles, using an auto-adjusting Proof-of-Work difficulty may be overkill.  I expect some gut-level reaction from people who are convinced that the bitcoin way is the only way to use a block chain.  As my discussion above indicates, I think not.  If you think otherwise, please point to a white paper or discussion that shows the reasoning why.  Gut reactions and arm-waving won\'t convince me, or the growing number of financial institutions and software houses that think otherwise.\n\n(Please note, a block chain can still be a solution for a data storage problem while not being the most efficient solution.

": 4, 'I actually think the issue is not about centralization, but about resolving policy in different ways.  PoW might end up centralized, where it\'s only cost effective for three organizations in the whole world to mine 99% of all blocks.  But that still could work out fine for blockchain safety.  Similarly, Stellar\'s SCP might work fine in such a scenario, particularly since other smaller parties would be constantly auditing the big three and would quickly raise the alarm on any double spend attacks.  So I think it\'s interesting to try to cook up some other concrete scenarios and think about what might happen with both Bitcoin and Stellar.\n\nHere\'s one:  US Government says: "We\'ve identified 10 addresses holding tons of coins that belong to bad people and are blacklisting them.  In Bitcoin, if you mine a block containing a payment to or from one of these addresses, you are profiting from terrorism/drugs/etc. and face felony charges."  In that case any US-based miners would censor such transactions.  But foreign miners might not.  So eventually those transactions might make it into the longest block chain.  Basically in this case the USG is delaying the transactions.  In Stellar, it could go down one of two ways:  Don\'t include bad addresses when you are proposing the ledger (similar failure mode to Bitcoin) or withhold consensus from such transactions, in which case the whole network grinds to a halt.\n\nHere\'s another one:  USG says, "Hey everyone, you can now pay your taxes in Bitcoin, but we\'re only going to consider the longest blockchain that after today includes no transactions to/from bad people\'s addresses."  Now this is very interesting because USG has specifically increased the value of a blockchain with one particular property.  Bitcoins potentially have greater or at least different value if you can get then through a USG-approved blockchain.  So now miners have a choice, should they mine on the longest blockchain, or on the longest blockchain whose reward can be spent towards US taxes?  Well, you\'ll probably have a split.  If 51% go for the USG-approved chain, then USG wins and you have censorship.  If 49% do, then you essentially have two flavors of Bitcoin on two different blockchains, though some transactions might happen to be valid in both blockchains.  In the Stellar case, there won\'t be a split, but again either the "bad" transactions are delayed, or the whole system comes to a grinding halt.\n\nNow if the Stellar system does grind to a halt, at least the 51%/49% thing has no relevance.  So what if 51% of the validating power falls under the jurisdiction of USG and allies?  If people decide to "de-peer" US validator nodes, they can consciously decide to approve transactions in the absence of consensus from the US.  It now becomes a giant game of chicken.  The US validator nodes are blocked from acknowledging the ledgers created in the rest of the world.  So they could just give in and accept what the rest of the world has agreed on, arguing that it happened without their consent--they are just reporting what happened, not making it happen.  Or they could consciously decide to de-peer the rest of the world and intentionally fork the ledger.\n\nIf this kind of digital money keeps taking off, eventually we are going to have these kinds of Tussles.  This is very similar to how the Internet evolved.  I highly recommend the Clark et al. Tussle in Cyberspace paper (http://bit.ly/199KPdu).  None of the digital currencies is going to avoid these problems; the question is what effect will they have on how the tussles play out.  The thing I find most appealing about consensus is the "flexible trust" aspect.  This speaks to what Clark et al. call "separation of policy and mechanism," which interestingly they say is too simplistic, while also stating there is value to protecting some parts of the system from policy decisions.  On the other hand, this is also the scariest aspect, because it creates more unknowns.  With Bitcoin, you have the comfort of knowing that for better or for worse tussles will be arbitrated by those with the most mining power.\n': 3, 'Can side-chains potentially speed up confirmations times?': 6, "The trust discussed in the paper isn't about trusting people with credit or loans or anything like that.

Deflationary currencies are just that... deflationary, that is, the wages you make to pay back the loan will continue to purchase less and less, meaning your ability to pay back the BTC you borrowed also decreases.\n\nBTC is arguably the most deflationary currency we've ever seen.  \n\nTo illustrate, imagine if you'd loaned someone 10,000 BTC in early 2010.  That was about $20 worth of BTC then.  Not a big loan, right?  Surely they can pay you back $20? After all, they make like $50,000 annually?  Since then, BTC has deflated by 10s of thousands of percentage points.  The individual you loaned that money to, now owes you about $2.5M worth of BTC.  Their BTC amount owed to you hasn't changed, but their ABILITY to pay you back in equivalent purchasing power has decreased due to the deflation of bitcoin.  You as the lender, just lost out, big time.  You would never make another loan.\n\nAs a potential lender, you never make a loan with a currency you expected to deflated.   Without loans, our economy would stagnate and suffer, this is why the federal reserve works to keep an INFLATION rate of about 2% annually.  Inflationary currencies promote lending (no one wants to hold the hot potato so you loan it out).  Deflationary currencies are the opposite, you HODL them.\n\nSource:  Economist and CPA": 0, "The operational documents of the federally-contracted wing of Buttcoin's Media Narrative Team, for like 40BTC": -2, 'How about that!

If my loan agreement stipulated that I must repay the BTC value (as in your example), I could repay all 1000 BTC today at the USD value of $220k. That\'s a pretty good deal!\n\nSure, if you did that it would have worked out.  You chose one peak and one valley on a 6-year curve and turned a profit.  Nice job, hindsight is 20/20.  But for your example to work, you would\'ve needed a lender to loan it to you at $1000 and then a buyer at $220.  No such lender existed then, which is my original point.  You\'re also ignoring that the  "currency" in that transaction is the $, not BTC.  BTC is the commodity in that example, not a currency.\n\nI\'m asserting that no lenders of BTC will exist... because of the nature of BTC being deflationary.  Are there any lenders of BTC?  I can get a loan in pretty much any currency, EXCEPT, bitcoin.  This is because although BTC claims to be a currecny, it is not, it\'s simply a commodity... and a deflationary commodity at that.\n\n': 1, '>When people say that BTC is deflationary, they\'re saying that the final supply is limited to 21 million\n\nNo, when I say BTC is deflationary, i\'m saying that it is actively deflating against other currencies.

Run the curve on a 200+ day moving average and you\'ve got a steady uptrend in BTC value vs. other currencies.  \n\n>You\'ve illustrated market value inflation, which can be dangerous for lenders. Conversely, market value deflation is dangerous for lenders.\n\nYou\'ll need to clarify this statement.  It seems to be saying that no matter what, it\'s dangerous for lenders.  I fail to see how this disagrees with what I said orginally, "No one would make a loan in bitcoin"\n\nYou know... because... risk.\n\n> It\'s not unique to bitcoin at all \n\nThat\'s correct.  But one difference in bitcoin is that it\'s decentralized, so that when a deflationary cycle starts with bitcoin, there is no entity to help soften the blow or turn things around.   That type of volatility will be it\'s downfall.  You can reset the $\'s value by attaching it to other assets, we\'ve done this a number of times in US history during volatile economic periods.  Bitcoin does not allow for this mechanic, it\'s literally "deflation incarnate"... by design. ': 1, "It doesn't matter at all whether the currency is deflating or inflating.

Since a single bitcoin is near-infinitely divisible, this is not a problem.\n\nYou've illustrated market value inflation, which can be dangerous for lenders. Conversely, market value *de*flation is dangerous for *lenders*. For example, if I borrowed 1000 BTC in 2013 when they cost $1000, my loan would be worth $1 million USD. If my loan agreement stipulated that I must repay the BTC value (as in your example), I could repay all 1000 BTC today at the USD value of $220k. That's a pretty good deal!\n\nOf course, this is an issue with ANY currency or asset that fluctuates dramatically against whatever you're comparing it to. It's not unique to bitcoin at all and it only depends on which currency the loan should be based on. If the economy is primarily BTC based, then a loan for 1 BTC will be repaid as 1 BTC, regardless of what happens to USD value inflation, or any other currency.

Right now financial transactions have to take place end-to-end on rails such as Paypal, Visa or SWIFT, and the rails belong to the railroad company.

As many still believe today, we also initially thought that "banks" and "Western Union" were taking advantage of poor consumers via monopoly of slow-anti-consumer service, that fees were relatively high, and that frequent senders were yearning for a better solution. After couple months of field research, we realized that our stereotypical view was pretty much wrong, and the space is too competitive (in other words, we are not capable enough to successfully play in it). We also estimated that we would need to raise around $100MM to get to a 1% global market share (see TransferWise funding so far or Xoom\'s pre-IPO) - it would still take around 5 years to get to such milestone with highly negative cash flow at the end - and we realistically didn\'t have a track record for "smart money" to make such bet on us. Therefore, we punted to a simple comparison app for now.\n\nHowever, there are much more capable folks out there who could both execute and raise funds (imagine "dream team" of execs from WU Digital, Xoom, Uber, Airbnb) - when all of us see such team and learn that they raised $10+MM in the initial round, it would be an indication that there is finally some minimal chance for bitcoin remittances to become a contender few years later.\n\nIn the meantime, any milestone for bitcoin remittances is the success story, even if it is just 1,000 repeat users among frequent senders. Please write in the blog post\'s thread if you hear of such fiat-to-fiat provider anywhere in the world, so we could research and update our list.\n\nThanks again!': 2, '> Six years after its introduction Bitcoin has yet to win any such tests against reality.\n\nStrongly disagree. The use cases are narrow, limited, and insufficient to support the current price, but they decidedly exist. Present use cases where bitcoin unambiguously wins: dark markets; ransomware; online tipping. Those, combined with speculation, have gotten us where we are today.\n\nI think where we agree is that the *next* such use case is non-obvious.

I agree the sending of money is a very small part of the backend cost in sending remittances. The costs are in the recording, tracking, clearing of transactions.  Bitcoin gets rid of all that by doing it all automagically on the blockchain.  Furthermore, with more speed and accuracy I would think there would be fewer front end customer issues to deal with but time will tell.  In the end for customers to move from traditional carriers to Bitcoin there\'s going to have to be a big motivation...that means money savings that are worth the effort to overcome, as one person put it, the inertia involved  in making the change and learning the new system or routine, when the person would rather be doing something else like "sleeping" or "doing something fun for a change.\n\nCase in point, when I heard you could get Starbucks for 20% using the "foldapp" site, I got off the couch yesterday and made a special trip just to try it out...it works like magic.

In fact it\'s scientifically proven that having too much choice paralyzes people, so they end up not buying anything at all.\n\nSo then maybe a seller might limit choice to only the top 3 cryptocurrencies. But why is this necessary? Bitcoin is a global currency that *anyone* can use. It\'s not like with fiat currency where you must cater to specific regions. Bitcoin is not region locked. Neither are Litecoins or Dogecoins for that matter. So if all cryptocurrency is global, is it really necessary to have to accept multiple ones?\n\nKeep in mind different coins are completely incompatible with each other\'s network. You say that the ability to convert between altcoins is easy, but in actuality it just adds another layer of friction - a pretty unnecessary layer of friction, I might add. There are costs involved in converting. So again, why do it *if you don\'t have to*.\n\nNow imagine a world where there are 50 or 100 different internets. That\'s right, completely different internet protocols where each one is incompatible with the other. It\'s possible to convert information in order to communicate with someone who is on a different internet, but this adds cost and friction. Can you not see how ridiculous this is? The reason we have only one internet is *because* it is intended to be a global network with global reach. Why would someone want to invest in and use a different internet protocol when hardly anyone else is using it? That fact that no one else uses it makes it useless and worthless. So it turns out if you have an issue with the way the internet works, it\'s easier to build a solution on top of it rather that to build an entirely new internet from scratch.\n\nDo you see the parallels? Bitcoin is *the* cryptocurrency. That is why every altcoin\'s price is determined by pairing it with BTC. That is why most of the money from investors and venture capitalists has gone into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Bitcoin is the safest bet because of the immense momentum it has compared to altcoins.\n\nLet\'s be real here. Let\'s not kid ourselves about why people buy altcoins. People buy altcoins because they want to get in early and be like those lucky few who got into Bitcoin early, and reap massive gains. But that\'s simply not realistic. Remember, it\'s easier to build on top of Bitcoin rather than to build an entirely new coin from scratch, expecting everyone to adopt it. Even genuinely innovative coins have a difficult time gaining traction. Also let\'s be realistic, are governments going to allow anonymous coins like Monero or Darkcoin? Of course not.

That\'s 212.5 bitcoins * cost in dollars per bitcoin =\n\nSo line 12 should be about 50,000 dollars --\n\nNow the cool thing with your spreadsheet -- you could do other columns, one column for each value - how far back in time (how many confirmations) do you want.\n\nFor others in the US - the spreadsheet is using European commas and decimals. So the "50.454" figure means $50454 dollars to bribe 1/4 the hashrate to undo 1 confirmation.\n\nWhere things get interesting is the cost to undo 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 confirmations:\n\nAnd there seems to be something not quite right about the formula --- because it\'s getting less expensive to bribe for higher confirmations.\n\nSomethings wrong with the B7 formula .... \n\nYou can see the problem if you make a separate column for higher and higher confirmation numbers and compare them.\n\nEDIT: one thing that\'s weird about the spreadsheet is the "bribing concept" itself -- intuititively, it gets more and more unlikely that they would actually succeed at undoing a deeply confirmed transaction, but it\'s 100% likely that this kind of deep-confirmation bribery market undercuts what bitcoin is trying to do.

But conditions were so harsh that from the late sixteenth century a system of forced labour (la mita) had to be introduced, whereby men aged between 18 and 50 from the sixteen highland provinces were conscripted for seventeen weeks a year.\n>Rodrigo de Loaisa called the mines 'infernal pits', noting that 'if twenty healthy Indians enter on Monday, half may emerge crippled on Saturday'. In the words of the Augustinian monk Fray Antonio de la Calancha, writing in 1638: 'Every peso coin minted in Potosi has cost the life of ten Indians who have died in the depths of the mines.'

And even then it will only be profitable to turn off already-bought equipment if the marginal cost of mining a block is greater than the value of the reward in the block.  I suspect capital costs will be more significant in the short term, so we'll see switch-offs happening slowly rather than suddenly.\n\nAs to effect on bitcoin price, well, unless you think the majority of the bitcoins for sale are newly mined coins (you only need to look at volumes to see that isn't so), the price will barely alter.\n\nAs evidence: the last halving was a complete non-event.": 0, 'Here\'s my theory: the block reward can be thought of as a  "bear whale" who every 10 minutes puts in a market order to sell 25 BTC.  The "supply curve" of the block reward is a vertical line at "3600 BTC/day" (the price doesn\'t matter).\n\nMiners can be thought of as BTC retailers who have a way to buy BTC at "wholesale" prices (long term the cost of electricity plus hardware must be no more than the market price or else miners would just buy the bitcoins at market price). Miners then either resell their "wholesale bear whale" bitcoins to people who buy them at market price (arbitrage), or hold them (in which case THEY are the buyers from the bear whale).\n\nEither way, for the price of bitcoin to stay at say $240, there must currently be demand for 3,600 BTC a day at that price. Some of that demand is from buyers on exchanges and some of that demand is from miners choosing NOT TO SELL on exchanges for that price.\n\nSo the question is, when the "bear whale" decides sometime around next August to start only selling 12.5 BTC every ten minutes, something everybody knows he\'s going to do (the supply curve shifts to the left from "3600 BTC/day" to "1800 BTC/day")... will that affect the demand curve?\n\nIf it doesn\'t then the price should go up, because the place where the supply and demand curves intersect has now moved to the left, which means UP the demand curve, to a higher price (though not necessarily double the old price).\n\nUnfortunately, the demand *curve* (not just the demand) for bitcoin probably IS tied to the price. In fact, people may already be refusing to sell bitcoin in the expectation the price will go up at the next halving, and perhaps when it doesn\'t (or doesn\'t go up enough), they might decide $240 is the time to sell after all, changing the demand curve. Or perhaps the price starting to rise a little will encourage people to buy more, start a bit of a speculative bubble again, and cause the demand curve to shift the other way.\n\nThat\'s markets for you!

At the time, BTC was $290 and hash rate was 320 PH/s.\n\nToday, the price is $237 and hash rate just dropped to 290 PH this morning.\n\nFrom a mining perspective, current generation miners have a gross margin exceeding 50% at present. The average old miner is barely trudging along. Please, note that although new miners are operationally profitable, this does not account for the cost of capital. In everyday speak, it means they make enough to pay for salaries and electricity, but the payback time for hardware and setup costs still stretches into the future.\n\nWith the next halving, which is little more than one year away, and at the current price and hash levels, most miners become unprofitable. Older-generation miners will be hit hardest--I'm estimating that's worth up to 200 PH of hashing power. While new miners can break even at best.\n\nAs old miners drop out, the better capitalized operators will be able to hold on until the hash rate drops to around 180 PH, where they are again breaking even. At this point current generation miners are making around 30% gross margin, but getting a good return on capital is looking bleak. This in turn stifles the amount of investment going into R&D to develop faster, more energy-efficient chips.\n\nA 30% gross margin is still decent, so new entrants may come, pushing the hash rate north of 180 PH/s.\n\nThis scenario is based on constant price and technology assumptions. If bitcoin price were to materially appreciate, the hash rate would also increase. If ASICs suddenly became more energy efficient, the overall hash rate would be higher.\n\nWith the reported amount of investments going into Bitcoin these days, I'm not convinced that the hash rate wouldn't just keep climbing over the medium term due to the flood of money coming on board. In this scenario, the hash rate could reach 500 PH/s, with diminished profits even for the best operator.\n\nAnother variable to consider is price. If miners are expecting bitcoins to be worth thousands of dollars down the line, big players are able to keep mining at an initial loss to accumulate bitcoins. As an aside, the Bitcoin market being notoriously shallow makes it too easy for them to manipulate. They could depress the price for a few months to force out small players and discourage others from entering, or pump and dump to create volatility that scares people away.\n\nIMHO, in the end, it's mostly about who has the most capital.

It depends on a lot of unknowns. If the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is approved, Bitcoin's price could reach $10,000+ IMO. \n\nMy recommendation: start dollar cost averaging in now while the price is still low.  I sat down and looked at what I could afford to lose.  My employer matches 100% of my 401K contribution up to 4% of my pay, and 50% from 4 to 8%, so I didn't want to touch any of that. I originally decided to put 4% of my pay into Bitcoin using Bitwage. I recently received a 2% raise, so I raised my Bitwage contribution to 6%. It hurts, but I think that the long term payoff will be significant. 8% 401K + 6% Bitcoin = 14% of my pay into retirement savings.\n\n Since I am dollar cost averaging in, I feel less impacted by the dramatic swings in Bitcoin's price.

Unless you can connect that wallet to a person, that information is completely useless."\n\nPartially true.  But your blockchain transaction cites your IP address, and we all know that hasn\'t slowed down law enforcement in apprehending actual people.  Sure you could go through Tor, but the average person doesn\'t use that, and even that is potentially leaky.  Furthermore, sending BTC around to different addresses is somewhat useless, unless you can actually spend or exchange that BTC.  Sure, you could hold it for a long time, but that just postpones the process.  In most spending situations, you either buy something online, (in which case a mailing address is frequently required) or you buy something in-person.  In either scenario, your identity can be compromised.  (By the way, According to Snowden, nothing online is 100% safe.  And considering he had PrivAc clearance at the NSA, I take his word for it.)\n\n---\n\n\n> "Fiat can absolutely be transferred "privately" (or anonymously), so long as you\'re physically exchanging paper bills with a party whose identity you don\'t know."\n\nI agree with the first part of that statement, but would cross out: "...so long as you\'re physically exchanging paper bills with a party whose identity you don\'t know."  Nearly all the world\'s wealth is represented in digital fiat.  And nearly all laundering is done via network transactions (digital of course).  At this stage, conversion to paper is unnecessary, and only raises red flags.  The USD serves as a proven mechanism for laundering.  No one knows how much USD is laundered each year, but when the US claims that just Luxembourg launders/ed $200b/yr, then I\'d guess the worldwide total is at least $1t/yr.\n\n---\n\n> "I don\'t think that there\'s any such thing as a "private account" that is completely disconnected from the identity of its owner. And, even if there is, how does the criminal that owns the account actually get to his money? Does he show up in person to get a briefcase full of cash? (And, if so, how does the bank know that he\'s an authorized account-holder, seeing as how they didn\'t bother to get any personally identifying information from him?) Does he transfer the money to a bank account under his own name so he can spend it? Does this hypothetical anonymous off-shore bank account have a debit card associated with it or something?\n\n> If you\'re dealing in fiat through the financial system, you\'re eventually going to have to cough up some personal identifying information or otherwise expose yourself to get at your money. I\'m sure there are potential ways around this (false identities, forged documents, etc.), but any of those avenues are more complicated than just having a bitcoin wallet floating around in the ether that\'s completely disconnected from your identity."\n\nTaking the time to write a primer on laundering isn\'t something I\'d do online, and way beyond the scope of a reddit comment.  Furthermore, I\'m sure there are much more sophisticated mechanisms in place today than the few older techniques I\'m aware of.  The gist of your comment suggests you don\'t think laundering is possible or at least easy.  I\'m not going to debate this with you, except to say it is possible and relatively easy.\n\n---\n\n> "Cash is also fundamentally "non-reversible"; if you hand someone $1000 in exchange for a good or service, how exactly can you go about reversing that transaction?"\n\nYes, non-counterfeited paper cash is truly non-reversible (per my comment above).  Like gold and several other things.  But not the \n**digital** transfer of "cash" **at its base state.**  When you send a SWIFT transfer (I don\'t want to get into the technicals here, except to say SWIFT is essentially a messaging system, not a payment system\xe2\x80\x94contrary to popular belief) the network is essentially sending (and replying to) a series of verifications, as well as structuring insurance into the transfer.  That\'s why you can send a chunk of money say $100k in a few days at reasonable cost, but to do so in under 12 hours, will cost an arm and leg.  The primary cost of the transfer is the augmented insurance to account for a fundamentally weak security architecture.  Not to mention, every bank involved (and a typical international transfer has a minimum of four) wants their slice of the pie.  (Bitcoin is vastly superior to this current approach.)\n\n> "We have, however, "add[ed] reversibility" to the fiat system in most cases because most transactions happen through intermediaries that can do charge-backs."\n\nAt the **base level** of fiat, we haven\'t so much "added" reversibility to digital fiat, as it\'s proven to be fundamentally too difficult to do so.  It\'s more like we\'ve accepted it, and found work-arounds that usually resolve in a reasonable transfer time, while affording degrees of insurance to protect the transaction.  This happens behind the scenes, at the bank-to-bank, bank-to-clearing house and central bank-to-bank levels.  And at this fundamental stage, reversibility is a hindrance to the exchange process, and measures are taken to eliminate reversibility.\n\nWhen we move up a couple levels to the type of money we, as consumers use, then reversibility is most certainly added, and it plays a very valuable role for us.  I think we all like the fact that we can reverse a false charge on our credit cards, as an example.\n\nBy the way, I don\'t mean to sound opaque about some of this.  Your questions are big questions, so I\'m trying to answer as concisely as I can without simplifying too much.\n\nAnyway, the above mentioned consumer fiat, which most commonly appears as that in the M2 monetary index or "purchasing power", via credit cards, etc. is mostly reversible\xe2\x80\x94but at this level, it\'s a good thing.  This is getting integrated into Bitcoin, and surprisingly many of the solutions do not require a third-party intermediary, as you alluded to.\n\n\n---\n\n> "It sounds as though we agree that Bitcoin is a superior payment mechanism in this context because it facilitates an illegal transaction, although we disagree as to how."\n\n\nBitcoin isn\'t superior because it "facilitates an illegal transaction."  It\'s simply superior.  And because it is superior, it facilitates all kinds of transactions better, legal and illegal.  It\'s like the fact that TCP/IP is clearly better than say, the old Minitel network.  Because TCP/IP is superior, all kinds of information exchange is possible (text, 256k-colour, pictures, vidoes), whether they are legal and illegal.  The same analogy holds true for a sports car.  It\'s like saying a sports car is better because it facilitates breaking the law.  No.  A sports car just accelerates, brakes and hugs the road better, therefore it\'s better for all kinds of things that require that.  Mostly having fun.  But of course you could use a sports car for illegal things as well.  As with any good tool.  And Bitcoin is nothing other than a good tool, with all the good and bad that entails.\n\n---\n\n\n> "This seems like a non-sequitur. Why are you assuming that non-reversibility is so great?"\n\nNon-reversibility is one of the cherished gems of a good currency.  I hope I touched on this above.  It\'s rarely better at the consumer level.  But it\'s critical at the inter-bank, inter-business and Fed exchange level.  It\'s a key component of a powerful currency.  And by Bitcoin\'s architecture, it has it natively. Consumer facing charge back services are of course also needed, regardless of currency.

Anyone looking to launder real dollar amounts or anyone truly concerned about privacy isn\'t going to use Bitcoin. The blockchain is clear text[.]\n\nBut the blockchain isn\'t connected to anyone\'s real-world identity.  Anyone can make a wallet and have someone send bitcoin to it, and although the transaction to the newly-created wallet is on the blockchain for all the world to see, nobody knows which _person_ received that money.  Who cares if the public ledger reflects a transaction of 100 BTC to 19W9sz1G9zVegmZTj3hxavs7XUFX75tf5y?  Unless you can connect that wallet to a person, that information is completely useless.  The holder of that wallet could transfer their ill-gotten bitcoin around completely anonymously so long as they stick to the blockchain.  People generally run into trouble when they try to convert their bitcoin into fiat through a broker or payment processor, which actually _does_ require real-world identifying information from the person that they\'re doing business with.  Which leads me to your next point:\n\n>[W]hy subject your transaction to the statistical reliability of a tumbler, when you can use a proven system instead: the US dollar.  Established currencies have been exchanged privately since the beginning of time[.]\n\nFiat can absolutely be transferred "privately" (or anonymously), so long as you\'re physically exchanging paper bills with a party whose identity you don\'t know.  Everyone\'s familiar with the trope of a criminal commanding someone to drop off however-many-thousand dollars of "unmarked" bills in an agreed-upon spot.  If the criminal collects that money and is unobserved, then yeah, the transaction is completely private and essentially untraceable.\n\nBut the fiat system really doesn\'t work that way in practice.  Most transactions happen through intermediaries.  Those intermediaries keep a ton of information about people that use their services, either to protect themselves (if a borrower defaults on you, you\'ll probably want to be able to identify that person and "track them down"), or to comply with regulations (most developed countries have pretty strict recordkeeping requirements).  Some countries do not, which leads me to your next point:\n\n>Established currencies have been exchanged privately since the beginning of time, which is why states like Luxembourg and Lichtenstein have an economy. It\'s also why the Cayman Islands has only one high-school and over 1,400 banks.  People serious about their craft don\'t take chances with things like Bitcoin\'s "pseudonomous" offering.  Money can be wired to a private account just as easily as anything else.\n\nYou seem to be suggesting that someone can open up an "anonymous" bank account in the Cayman Islands (or elsewhere) and safely have ransom money sent there without the funds being traceable to you; like I could just open up a bank account under the name "TobyTheRobot" (as opposed to my real name) and have my fiat ransom sent there.  I\'ll confess that I\'m not an expert in the intricacies of setting up an offshore bank account, but I did a quick Google search for the requirements to open a bank account in the Cayman islands, and it appears that the requirements are much the same as they are just about everywhere else:\n\n>**The basics of opening an offshore bank account are similar to opening a bank account in your home country. Offshore banks will ask for your personal information, such as your name, date of birth, address, citizenship and occupation.**  To verify your personal information, you can expect to submit a copy of your passport, driver\'s license or other identifying documents issued by a governmental agency. Additionally, banks are concerned with verifying your residence or physical address since this may affect taxation issues. This requirement may be satisfied by presenting a utility bill or similar documents.\n\nhttp://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/11/opening-an-offshore-bank-account.asp.\n\nI don\'t think that there\'s any such thing as a "private account" that is completely disconnected from the identity of its owner.  And, even if there is, how does the criminal that owns the account actually get to his money?  Does he show up in person to get a briefcase full of cash? (And, if so, how does the bank know that he\'s an authorized account-holder, seeing as how they didn\'t bother to get any personally identifying information from him?)  Does he transfer the money to a bank account under his own name so he can spend it?  Does this hypothetical anonymous off-shore bank account have a debit card associated with it or something?\n\nIf you\'re dealing in fiat through the financial system, you\'re eventually going to have to cough up some personal identifying information or otherwise expose yourself to get at your money.  I\'m sure there are potential ways around this (false identities, forged documents, etc.), but any of those avenues are more complicated than just having a bitcoin wallet floating around in the ether that\'s completely disconnected from your identity.\n\n>Bitcoin is superior as a general currency for many reasons, but in this context it has nothing to do with a presupposed degree anonymity, and everything to do with its non-reversability.\n>Which brings me to my second point. This quality, which is typically limited to cash and some commodities (such as gold) is a critical function for a currency to be used in thousands of different types of transactions instantly. It\'s trivial to add reversability, to a non-reversable currency, but nearly impossible to do the opposite.\n\nCash is also fundamentally "non-reversible"; if you hand someone $1000 in exchange for a good or service, how exactly can you go about reversing that transaction?  We have, however, "add[ed] reversibility" to the fiat system in most cases because most transactions happen through intermediaries that can do charge-backs.  Bitcoin could certainly do the same thing, as you suggest, by incorporating trusted intermediaries into its own structure.  But sending BTC through the blockchain is the equivalent of leaving a briefcase of unmarked bills in a trash can; it\'s essentially untraceable (the blockchain will reflect that the transaction occurred, but it says nothing about to _whom_ the money was sent; it\'s like knowing that cash was left in a trash can but not knowing who picked it up).  Bitcoin isn\'t unique in this regard, although I suppose doing a blockchain transfer is logistically simpler than leaving a briefcase in a dumpster.\n\n>This is more likely why these criminals would want to use bitcoin here.

Once payment is made, it can\'t be rescinded, even if their coins are traced to an exchange.\n\nIt sounds as though we agree that Bitcoin is a superior payment mechanism in this context because it facilitates an illegal transaction, although we disagree as to _how._\n\n>It\'s also why central banks, insurance companies and corporations will all be using some form of crypto-currency in the future. Whether Bitcoin, FedCoin or what have you.\n\nThis seems like a non-sequitur.  Why are you assuming that non-reversibility is so great?  We\'ve added reversibility to the fiat system because we _like_ reversibility.  Again, fiat is an "inherently non-reversible system"; if you give cash to someone, there\'s no obvious way to reverse that transaction.  Financial intermediaries offer charge-back rights as a business-savvy consumer protection; people are more likely to use their credit cards if they know that they can get a charge-back if they get ripped off.  Companies like knowing that, if a mistake is made, it can be corrected.  And to whatever extent the law requires reversibility in transactions, that indicates that the government likes reversible transactions, too.\n\nThe fiat system could be non-reversible if we wanted it to be.
