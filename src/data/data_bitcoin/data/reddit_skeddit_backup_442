Obviously there are many definitions.  Since you "know" what "fiat" means, you picked the defintition that suited you, declared that the other one is wrong, and then claimed that Wikipedia says that you are right and I am wrong.  Well, if that makes you happy, keep thinking that way; what else can I say?\n\n> Per the American Heritage\xc2\xae Dictionary of the English Language "fiat" means:  2.

I have continued to read more English than Portuguese, almost every day, in the 23 years after coming back to Brazil.  \n\nWell, never ***once*** in all that time did I read or hear someone use the word "fiat" to mean the thing that everybody called "money".  The first time I saw it used that way was 18 months ago, when I started reading about bitcoin.  I found that jargon bizarre, and still cannot bring myself to use it.  It seems that it is "cult speak" among "goldbugs" and/or libertarians and/or ancaps to refer disparagingly to common money as "fiat", to underscore the fact that it is created by evil  irresponsible governments -- as opposed to "real money", which would be gold originally, and now also includes bitcoin the "digital gold".\n\nSo, please, it is not "how the world understands fiat money", but perhaps how *your* world uses that term.\n\n> You also seem to be patently unable to admit a mistake or error.\n\nIndeed, I have this bad habit of not admitting an error as long as I think I am right... ;-)\n': -5, 'It is defintiely a fiat currency.

There was a time when spam was really a big problem (also at my job). Then they changed the law in the Netherlands, where I live, and companies were forced to add the option to unsubscribe. Also e-mail servers tried hard to reduce spam for their custumers. Since then spam is much less of a problem (maybe for the famous people it still is a hard problem?). However, at the time I thought: spam can be a really hard problem that\'s impossible to solve unless you add a whitelist and why haven\'t e-mail clients the option to add a whitelist instead of all the other lousy anit-spam measures they include as options. Of course, the problem then is that nobody can ever enter that is not on the whitelist, not even some old friend that found your e-mail address on the internet or something.\n\nNot long ago I read that the Prove-of-Work that bitcoin is based on was initially developed as an anti-spam measure. So I thought why not use bitcoin as an anti-spam measure because this is basically adding the necessity for the spammer to apply some prove of work. This, combined with my above whitelist solution and problem gave me my idea.\n\nYou have a good point I hadn\'t considered: locking yourself out of registering for any service, so you must be able to disable it easily if you expect such an e-mail.\n\nBased on your comment I would say that we need an on-line service that contains and updates a list of all non-zero bitcoin addresses and returnes f(address, value)=1 if the amount of bitcoin for that address is >= value otherwise 0. You could mail the sender that after an hour you will check the amount of bitcoin and will add the e-mail address automatically to the whitelist if the amount is correct. That way you wouldn\'t overburden the on-line service.\n\nBy the way thinking about it: another solution may be provided by 21inc. In the future you could demand some mining shares from the 21inc mining chip before you except an e-mail address that\'s not on your whitelist. This would also demand some prove of work from a spammer, so it would be very costly to send a lot of spam.\n\nAnyway, it\'s a good example of a possible problem "e-mail spam" that bitcoin could easily stop without killing the patient!': 1, 'Just send the replay only once to the same e-mail address.': 1, 'That\'s a really good idea. And it\'s quite easy to implement as well. All you need is a server that checks your email account via IMAP and automatically responds with the address it generates for every possible spammer. Even a personal solution would be quite cheap since a Raspberry Pi would have no problem dealing with these tasks.\n\nOne problem I see with it however is that you\'re locking yourself out of registering for any service that sends you an email with an activation code. In most cases you don\'t know exactly from which address these are going to come so you need a way of remotely disarming the spam blocker. This interface could be an attractive attack vector to your server.\n\nIf enough people use your method, ad delivery services will quickly pop up, collect payload and burst it through the one address they paid for. Then you\'d have to increase the price per whitelist entry and quickly your Raspberry Pi would need a lot more security to make sure you can actually pay back legitimate contacts without their deposit being stolen while they wait for you to react.\n\nSome of these problems could be solved by a centralized service to whom you give your email service credentials. Yeah... No need to go over the many reasons why this is a bad idea in detail. Apart from those you can expect them to break down pretty quickly and add "verified trusted certified special *add some more bullshit* partners" to your whitelist if they pay a flat rate to the service provider.\n\nAfter writing all this off the top of my head I\'m not sure anymore if I\'ve made more arguments for or against your idea.\n\nHow long have you thought about this?': 2, ">On technical level, the payment part uses a milter to check whether payment is required and then does a reject on SMTP level with a return code 550.\n\nI'm not sure every mail provider actually notifies its users of such return codes.\n\nWhy not send an automatic reply with a customizable message?": 1, "The return code of 550 should cause the sending email server to generate a bounce. According to wikipedia, this is the correct behaviour: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounce_message#Bouncing_vs._rejecting . \n\nThe reason I don't want the service to generate new email message (pseudo-bounce) myself is that I think that may exacerbate rather than solve spam. I realise that there is a tradeoff.\n\nBut at least in the particular objection you have (sender not receiving bounces), the problem would be a misconfigured sender mail server, so its admin should fix it.": 2, 'i see, not bad': 2, "I have this feature in https://mailchuck.com, I tested it but it hasn't been turned on for any real user yet.

User can specify the amount as well, you can specify it in BTC, USD, EUR or GBP, the exchange rate is determined at the time the payment request is generated using Coindesk BPI.\n\nOn technical level, the payment part uses a milter to check whether payment is required and then does a reject on SMTP level with a return code 550.\n\nMailchuck's primary goal is privacy, so it uses Bitmessage as a delivery system for email contents, so you don't need to expose your identity to me. The sender/recipient payment pairings are stored as a salted hash. The third party sender payment UI is fully generated on the client side (e.g. https://mailchuck.com/payment/#bitcoin:12A1MyfXbW6RhdRAZEqofac5jCQQjwEPBu?amount=1.2&label=Recipient&message=For%20what), so I don't know who's paying for what.

Tons of people provide content on Youtube and DeviantArt, even before any sort of ad revenue sharing was in place and today even without tapping into that. Lauren Faust was a Deviantart user before taking the helm of MLP, and Erika Mitchell published Master of the Universe for free, online, as twilight fan fic before it got cleaned up for legal clearance and repackaged as the best selling novel of all time.\n\nPatreon et al demonstrate that people are willing to engage with an audience without more than perhaps briefly delaying work to non-paying subscribers or giving out unrelated benefits like bonuses and offers to vote on future content to the paid subscribers.\n\nI feel like that's a hell of a better shape for how *canned information* should be disseminated, anyway.

Even if somebody robin-hooded to defeat the content delay, most unpaying people would voluntarily wait their turn to get the content properly from a creator who respects them in contrast to giving the finger to the lord of the elitist paywall or even taking their *only* available chance to evaluate whether or not it is content worth paying for.": 1, 'Cool stuff.

I was the one calling it a "scam", calling it a "Ponzi Scheme", and relating it to tulip bulbs.\n\nBut I had a person ask me if I had researched. If I knew how it worked. Was I at least willing to learn about bitcoin before criticizing it. And he was right. I always considered myself a rational person (and actually teach college economics) so how could I speak intelligently on a subject like bitcoin without even researching bitcoin.\n\nSo I started to research. How did it start. What is its purpose. Can it help transactions and movements of assets. So I also created a Coinbase account and bought $20 worth. Then created another Coinbase account and transferred about $5 worth. And saw how easy that was and realized how that could revolutionize asset transfer. Then I did more research.\n\nThen I was hooked. What a remarkable technological advance. I compare this to email back in the early 90\'s. I heard someone say "email address". I had no idea what that meant. Then months later I hear someone ask if I have an email address. Why? Nobody I know HAS an email address? And so it sends typed info. I have to go home, connect to the computer (with dial-up), connect to my Netscape account, and wait....and wait....and wait. What good is that?\n\nBut look at us now. Email is critical for business and communication. Everybody has at least one email address (many of us 5 or 6). Email now allows images and attachments to be instantly sent and received. We cannot live without email and the internet now.\n\nThe same will occur with bitcoin. Bitcoin is the next "round" of internet technology. The ability to send ASSETS as quickly and easily as email will revolutionize global and local transactions. It will take some years for full acceptance (it took email about a decade) but when bitcoin is finally accepted worldwide it will revolutionize "money" and the transfer of assets.': 10, 'its a terrible ponzi scheme, buy high sell low': 0, "It isn't a ponzi but think of it this way: what average Joe sees is Bitcoiners telling them to buy.

Perhaps because it looks totally like one?\n\nAs an e-payment system, bitcoin is defintely not a ponzi.  However, that use is not significant in the "bitcoin economy", because coins that are bought for that purpose will be promptly sold by the payment processor.  The bitcoin transfers then cancel out, and the net economic effect is basically the consumer sends dollars to the merchant, in exchange for goods and services.\n\nThe "ponzi" aspect lies in bitcoin as an investment or speculative instrument.   To analyze this aspect, we can divide the players of the "bitcoin system" into the new investors (N), who are increasing their holdings of bitcoin; the divestors (D), who are getting rid of their coins; the miners and the makers of mining equipment (M); and the service companies (S) like BitPay, Bitstamp, BIT, etc.  (The holders, who own coins but are neither buying nor selling, can  be included in either N or D, it does not matter.)\n\nThe net money flow in the system is: dollars enter the system exclusively from N, and exit the system through D, M, and S.  (For simplicity of analysis, consider exchanges of bitcoins by goods, services, and other national currencies translated into exchanges of bitcoins and dollars.)\n\nThe flow N-->M is currently about 800\'000 USD/day.  It is proportional to the BTC price and to the block reward.\n\nThe flow N-->D is totally unknown, but is certainly positive, and may be more than N-->M.\n\nThe flow N-->S consists of the various fees, spreads, and other revenues that the service companies collect; it is probably small compared to the other two.\n\nBesides the net money flow, there is a return net flow of bitcoins from M and D to N (which may temporarily go through S, but that part eventually cancels out).  However, bitcoins do not create dollars and will not turn into magically into dollars.  The investors N can only recover their investment by changing their role to D (which moves their coins too from N to D), and selling their coins to the other investors in N.  \n\nSo, in this analysis, the bitcoins are created by M and keep churning between N and D; while those people who are in N must continuously pour new money into the system -- one million dollars a day or more.\n\nNo matter what path it follow, that money will eventually and permanently leave the system through D, M, and S.  The system can only be sustained as long as it can recruit enough new investors into N and convice them to put enough new money into the system.\n\nPeople who understand something about investing can easily perceive this money flow as soon as they learn about bitcoin. That is why they call bitcoin a "ponzi".  Bitcoin may not be a *deliberate* ponzi (as a former IMF official observed), but it has turned into one.\n\nActually, the result of a perfect ponzi (where the operator does not take any profit) is simply to shuffle money between the investors.  Therfore, while the earlier investors may expect a profit, and the later ones should expect a loss, the expected gain for a random investor is zero.  In the "bitcoin ponzi", however, the miner class M takes a large fraction of the money that the investors N put in, before the divestors D take theirs.  The expected gain for a random investor (starting at N and eventually moving to D) is therefore negative.  \n\nThe world does not need another ponzi; much less a dumb and complicated one.  Besides fleecing unwary investors, the use of bitcoin as investment and speculative instrument is the main cause of the price\'s extreme volatility, which in turn is one of the obstacles to its adoption as currency.   For the public good, and for the health and success of bitcon-as-currency, bitcoin-as-investment should die as soon as possible.\n\nUnfortunately, bitcoin-as-currency depends on the miners to secure the blockchain, and their hashrate is basically proportional to their revenue.  Until transaction fees become significant, that revenue must come from the new investors N.  \n\nHow will bitcoin get out of this pothole?

Then they think why should i buy coins and then realizes it's because it makes that first person's coins worth more. For an outsider this looks an awful lot like a ponzi. The fact that tons of Bitcoiners actually act this way doesn't help the case.\n\nThat's a good point actually. Most people just keep saying that those bitcoiners are just keep letting more of them involved in bitcoin and then the price will go up and they will make bunch of profits. That's not what bitcoin was intended to do.": 2, '"Ponzi scheme" is a term (mis-)used to describe anything financial that an average person thinks might be a scam. I blame Madoff for popularizing the term.\n\nThey think bitcoin is a scam because of bad press, and the fact that early adopters own significant proportions of all potential coins in existence. In their view, bitcoin is a giant scheme by Satoshi to make himself fabulously wealthy. By convincing others to use it, Satoshi is trying to make himself rich, and that is a scam.\n\nThe best counter-argument to this is that Satoshi hasn\'t cashed out his coins. He could have (setting aside the "if he moves them it all crashes" argument), when their notional value was over $1 billion at the peak of 2013, but he didn\'t. Until he spends his coins, there is no proof that he is scamming anyone.\n\nEither way, bitcoin isn\'t a ponzi scheme. A ponzi scheme involves a central figure promising high returns to investors. He provides those returns by soliciting fresh funds from a new round of investors, which he uses to provide returns to the first round. To pay the second group, he solicits funds from a third, and so on. \n\nBitcoin isn\'t a ponzi scheme because nobody promises anyone else high returns. You own it, you might lose money, and you might make money. But you don\'t go in expecting to earn 20% a year, and that 20% isn\'t coming from other suckers.\n\ntl;dr bitcoin might be a scam (but probably isn\'t), but it certainly is not a ponzi scheme.': 5, "I ended up losing my primary handle for posting a simple survey/request for feedback in /r/boston hoping to find a good spot to launch my Bitcoin ATM, this was back in 2013.

See bitmesh for the first step: https://www.bitmesh.network/.\n\n> Best info I could find on a quick search for Super Wifi throughput is 20mbps down / 6mbps up.\n\nIt\'s also a first step. Basically most of the good spectrum is used for TV channels (unbelievable) and the wireless carriers (AT&T, Verizon, etc). These are essentially government regulated monopolies. When this spectrum is reallocated to something like super wifi the speeds will be much faster. Also, you\'re thinking about a single connection. What if you connect to 10 20mbps connections at the same time. Ultimately, this is just a better design.\n\n> Wireless networking, especially area-blanketing / not a tight point-to-point beam, also tends to have latency and jitter problems.\n\nThis is not really an either/or situation. You might still choose to have a wired connection and you will probably benefit by reselling the bandwidth you are not using to your neighbors to make their connections more efficient. You are not constantly using 100mbps 24/7, so you can share your connection with neighbors for a fee and possibly completely subsidize your bill.

Most streaming video will move to something like bittorrent in the future as well so you can be streaming video from multiple locations at the same time. In terms of savings, this introduces competition and optimizes things and I would expect would significantly reduce the cost of bandwidth overall. Many people would probably get their internet completely subsidized by sharing their connection.\n\nThis is very similar to what is happening in multiple industries right now.

Pure competition on rates. There is also a new technology that is just emerging called super wifi which allows a wifi connection of up to 100km. So, that basically eliminates the last mile. How many potential connections do you think there is in the nearest 100km of the average person? You don\'t have to call up your neighbor and get an agreement with them or do anything like that. Their router would just advertise a rate and you\'d connect to them and pay with bitcoin using payment channels. It\'s not extremely different, but it just allows peer to peer payments and you can connect no matter where you are without asking permission. If one of your neighbors blocks sites they consider immoral, you would just route around it. Your modem (or phone, or whatever device), would just always be negotiating with "Bitcoin ISPs" wherever you go, which include your neighbors, providers, etc. All that you\'d need to do is put bitcoin into your connection and you\'d be able to connect to whatever you want to. Also, in terms of someone potentially trying to block a site, that is also resolved by a technology called I2P (Invisible internet protocol).

Increasingly so as the number of nodes and crosstalk increases.  Wired is always faster and more reliable than wireless at the same level of technology development.  Both systems need to detect small, high frequency changes in an electromagnetic signal state.  Wireless has to deal with a hell of a lot more noise by the very nature of the transmission medium, which means the signal decode rate on wired consistently stays ahead of wireless.\n\nJust lol at the thought of playing a twitch reflex online game while my router is hopping connections to optimize penny shavings.': 1, "Sidechains are like ISPs: they don't exist and there is no roadmap to making them exist or even complete definition of how they would work.

There are a number of other proposals to deal with scaling. If you read the sidechain white paper, it's not really a scaling solution, it's a dev/test solution. They depend on merged mining. It means that in order to have any level of security you need probably around 80% of the miners on the network to mine your sidechain. So, basically it doesn't improve scalability at all because it just means that miners have to run some more software and still process all of the transactions if you want the same level of security. Some of the scaling solutions that have been proposed are:\n\n1.) Off chain transactions (like what coinbase and change tip are doing today)\n\n2.) IBLT - invertible bloom lookup table (proposed by Gavin)\n\n3.)
