Each child public key can then be regenerated independantly using the parent public key and that index information without the need or the private key.

"Most doctors" don\'t run pill mills. So when you say "most doctors" you are speaking about *most of a tiny fraction* of physicians (those who run pill mills). The DEA monitors every physician\'s dispensing history constantly. Pill mill docs histories light up like a fucking Christmas tree an the DEA comes down on them.\n\n> Do you think a shitty doctor exists in the United States that is still practicing?\n\nLogical fallacy - specifically [moving the goalposts](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Moving_the_goalposts). You previously said "where as I explain how doctors were having strip mall offices called pain centers". So we aren\'t talking about shitty doctors. We are talking about pill mill docs. Are there some in the US presently? Yep. Will they be flagged by the DEA and shut down? Also yep.\n\n> Do you think that the system makes it so that these shitty doctors get to practice a lot longer than maybe they should be able to?\n\nAgain, we\'re talking about pill mill docs. And the answer to that question is no. It\'s like asking if we let drunk drivers drive cars longer than they should. To be arrested for DUI, you have to 1) get drunk, 2) drive a car, and 3) get caught doing so. Similarly, pill mill docs have to 1) start prescribing in a fashion that shows them to be a pill mill doc, 2) be flagged by the DEA, and 3) be caught in a sting operation (generally the DEA sends people in as faux patients).\n\nThe problem is that the difference between a pain management doc and a pill mill doc is one of gradations. No one starts out thinking *when I finish school, I want to be a pill mill doc!*. Just as no one takes their first drink of alcohol wanting to become an alcoholic. People get into that situation because they are legitimate pain docs who get too tempted by the prospect of making money hand over fist by churning out narcotic rxs like a candy machine. Moreover distinguishing between a legitimate pain management doc and a pill mill doc is also one of gradations. Legit pain management docs also give a lot of opioids out. However the way they do so is a lot more controlled and it is *one part* of an otherwise full pain management arsenal. So just looking at how much oxycodone a physician prescribes isn\'t adequate, which is why the DEA does sting operations. I have a friend who is a pain management doc who was investigated by the DEA precisely because of the volume of opioids she prescribes, but when she was visited by DEA agents posing as patients, they realized that she was above board. Moreover those kind of things never come up in the news: *DEA stings local pain clinic: finds nothing amiss, film at 11.* \n\nSo given the complexities of the system the DEA does a decent job of keeping pill mill docs from prescribing narcotics as quickly as possible.

However I have written a number of MMJ recs for people who are already my primary care patients. When I do write recs though, I treat this similarly to writing an rx for any drug.

However more frequently, doctors have their DEA certificate limited or revoked. This makes them able to prescribe medicines, but not controlled medicines.\n\nWith regard to the New Yorker article, it\'s full of logical fallacies like this gem: "Studies have shown that patients who receive narcotics for chronic pain are less likely to recover function, and are less likely to go back to work." By the same token people who are treated with diabetes medicines are more likely to have heart attacks, strokes, and kidney failure. This is because diabetes makes you more likely to have those things, not because of the medicines used to treat it. Similarly, patients that are more severely injured in an accident are both less likely to return to work and more likely to need narcotic analgesics. Correlation doesn\'t prove causation. \n\n> By 2010, the United States, with about five per cent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population, was consuming ninety-nine per cent of the world\xe2\x80\x99s hydrocodone (the narcotic in Vicodin), along with eighty per cent of the oxycodone (in Percocet and OxyContin), and sixty-five per cent of the hydromorphone (in Dilaudid).\n\nAnd this is also in part because the rest of the world uses *cheaper* narcotic analgesics like morphine, codeine, and methadone. However it is the case that *western* countries use way more than their fare share of opioids than the developing world. However this is because of legal and bureaucratic restrictions in developing nations, which is a global crisis whereby [millions of cancer patients in the developing world](http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/815362) die in agony because of the unavailability of opioid analgesics.\n\nNow, I am not saying that we don\'t have a problem with prescription narcotics in the US. We do. However the solution to that is changes in drug policy that take away the non-rx demand for opioid analgesics by funding non-punitive drug treatment, methadone and suboxone programs, etc. The US\' problem with prescription drugs is more to do with the fucked up way that America deals with all drugs.': 0, "He was smart enough that he didn't have to accept Bitcoin.": 1, 'Guy must have been self-medicating the day he designed that ad...': 3, 'No, they\'re selling the license that people need to get into the regulated cannabis stores, and it lasts for a year before a renewal is needed.\n\nBasically weed is de facto legal in Cali as long as you have a formal doctor\'s recommendation, so naturally this creates demand for "rec mills" that pump out these licenses to anyone with $49 and some sort of health issue.\n\nThese doctors will go out of business the moment full legalization happens.': 10, 'but he immediately smokes them after 6 confirmations ': 3}, ('VWAP of bitcoin?', 5): {'http://bitcoin-analytics.com': 1, 'Go see http://btctrading.wordpress.com\n\nEnky heavily uses VWAP in many time frames.

Though it's arguable that some Drop Zone messages have value to the sender and receiver, they do not have value to others and persistence is not required. Further, it is merely the intent of testnet that the network be used for staging code without the risk of losing value. **Using testnet for communications is a cheap, anonymous mechanism to communicate. It is particularly efficient for mobile clients which do not maintain an open channel with minimal overhead.**\n\n> Regarding the communications, **the protocol specifically calls for an encrypted [testnet] communications channel**.  Obscuring the locations of those communications will be up to the reference client.  **If a wallet that routes through tor were to implement the Drop Zone protocol, then the location of the transaction location would be sufficiently obscured**.  Insofar as the testnet communications are encrypted, the content of those communications is not relevant.\n\n.\n\nAnd, in the paper (emphasis mine):\n\n> The goal of **the project's design should revolve around fast and efficient access by mobile devices**, without the need to store The Blockchain, and with the goal of executing queries against web-based api services that have no special knowledge of Drop Zone's functionality. Acceleration for Drop Zone clients, by such services, could be added merely by supporting the use of wildcards when querying public output addresses.\n\n> An application specific indexer, such as is available with blockchain.info, will arise that provides useful parsing of the Drop Zone network data in a presentation style similar to that of Craigslist.

They are easy to use and they don\'t require hours of blockchain downloading. \n\nIf you want to keep bitcoins as an investment,  I highly recommend learning how to use 2 factor authentication with services like Coinbase. Google authenticator is pretty good for this purpose. But you need to back up your shared secret somewhere in case your phone/tablet kicks the bucket. 2 factor authentication can be crucial if an attacker has taken your password. They still need your device to access your account. Look into this. \n\nI also recommend learning how to use a "live cd" if you generate offline wallets. A live cd is an operating system on a cd which "forgets" everything you did with it. This is important when creating an offline wallet because you can "air gap" everything between you and the internet attackers. Attackers can\'t steal what they can\'t see, and they can\'t see an air gapped computer.\n\nSorry if the world of bitcoin is overwhelming, keep in mind that bitcoin is still beta software!

Likewise, the investor would either sit on cash or spend it on less worthwhile projects, instead of buying the government bond.\n\nLet this happen on a national scale and you get an economy that runs very poorly.

Well, this is somewhat less clear even on its face\xe2\x80\x94why should the future generations benefit by default for the growth the current generation is responsible for? But even if you discount that moral question, economically speaking: *What if future growth isn't possible without the current financing?*\n\nIt's well accepted that credit economies are much more effective if that credit is used responsibly.
