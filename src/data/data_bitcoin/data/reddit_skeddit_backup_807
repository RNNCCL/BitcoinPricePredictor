Right now, Bitcoin\'s primary utility is as a highly-speculative (high risk, high potential reward) asset.  If it continues to succeed and grow, it may transition to being a less-speculative (lower risk, lower potential reward) gold-like store of value.  And if it\'s *really* successful, its primary utility may one day be as a currency, i.e. a direct medium of exchange with lots of "closed loops" where people earn and spend bitcoins without ever converting to fiat.  But success as a currency is much more reliant on network effects and so will take a much longer time to achieve (assuming it ever happens at all).  Finally, it should be noted that some of Bitcoin\'s current speculative value is based on its future potential usefulness as a currency.

The details are plenty and I've no time to get into them here.\n\nA tradeable product like Bitcoin solves the problems with traditional money while providing a mechanism to offload risk. SInce Bitcoin is not managed by a central entity, its value will remain volatile.  It's on the users to manage the risk.": 3, "There's a third camp: Those who believe that Bitcoin has utility, but believe that the current value is based mostly on speculation and may not be reflective of that utility.

Once it saturates those niche uses, its price should stabilize as there is no more upside since by hypothesis it is stuck. But a stable price really makes it look silly to hold gold instead of bitcoins, since then Bitcoin has almost every advantage in the store of value function that gold bugs seek. But replacing a large part of the gold market makes Bitcoin enormous in terms of market cap, and allows for many other uses not possible today. The ubiquity certainly would allow for pretty cheap and frictionless remittance, which gives another huge set of people the motivation to use it. \n\nBut here\'s where the magic happens. Think of the community of Bitcoin holders and users as an economic bloc, or as a virtual city. Any business that operates entirely within that city gets to experience the full benefits of Bitcoin: for example, not just cheaper remittances but almost free remittances with zero hassle since there is no need to go through fiat money at all. Frictionless transactions for everything. This is a city many businesses will want to "move to" simply because it\'s more profitable. At first it might only be manufacturers paying suppliers overseas in Bitcoin but dealing in fiat money with customers (B2B aspect is entirely in the city, but B2C remains outside). This accretes step by scarcely noticeable step, each one enabling things that were previously impossible, each one motivating more people to join the city and move more and more of their dealings under its umbrella. \n\nThe question of whether Bitcoin (or at least something like it) will take over was, to my mind, answered quite a while ago, when it was not only clear that the endgame of everyone using Bitcoin would be an extremely compelling future, but that the snowball had already starting rolling down the hill. Even if no further innovation happens, I think Bitcoin is destined to replace gold, for example, simply because it offers advantages that gold cannot ever offer. There\'s just nothing conceptually standing in its way other than volatility, which eventually goes away whether it stays niche or goes mainstream. Now implementation is another matter, but your question of whether Bitcoin solves a real problem is a conceptual one.\n\nEDIT: This also suggests a sub-dichotomy within those who object to Bitcoin on a conceptual basis: those who believe a world where everyone uses Bitcoin is not a desirable outcome, and those who merely believe that in the world as it is today Bitcoin adoption by a single individual provides little or no benefit to the average person, so that even if full mainstream adoption would be a great ideal it can never be reached since there is no motivation by the average person to take the necessary steps to get there. ': 11, 'Whoa! You got your whole point backwards, so your conclusion is the opposite of what it should be. \n\nHoarding increases the price, yes, which decreases, not increases volatility. Just think, if the price went down to $.10 per bitcoin, that would mean a market cap of $1.3 million. Anybody could sneeze and the market would go up or down by a factor of 2. Instead, as it is, it takes millions of $ to make the market move a few percent. If the price went up to $100000, all the biggest holders would have cashed out for the most part by then and there would be way less power to move the market.': 14, 'Well, I don\'t think it\'s true that libertarians as a rule don\'t like altcoins. I think that many Bitcoin holders are skeptical of the need for, and the likely success of, alt-ledgers, for reasons both self-interested and enlightened. (See my own views on the subject [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2fch11/would_you_argue_that_bitcoin_has_more_or_less/ck877up).)\n\nI think you\'re overestimating the extent to which the average person does view, or will view, the "bitcoin community" as this hugely politicized fringe group and underestimating the strength of Bitcoin\'s network effect and first-mover advantage. If people view Bitcoin as something that can help their bottom line, most of them are not going to sit on their hands just because they have some huge hangup about "libertarians." They\'re just going to use it. And frankly, I don\'t think most people *do* have any huge hangups about libertarians, not because they agree with the philosophy, but simply because most people aren\'t that ideological.\n\nAnd I think you\'re also overestimating the strength and persistence of Bitcoin\'s "icky libertarian" association. Again, it\'s already gotten weaker of necessity as the network and infrastructure have grown, and more mainstream companies have gotten involved.  And again, I don\'t see how that trend could not continue as Bitcoin grows.\n\nAlso, I think it\'s unrealistic to think that people will be able to simply launch some new cryptocurrency with "all of Bitcoin\'s strengths" and expect it to remain "untarnished" by libertarians. Bitcoin\'s strengths are that it\'s decentralized and censorship-resistant.

Grandmas found the internet to be very confusing, but they were willing to learn and try it because they really wanted to send their grandkids an email. People went to great lengths to overcome the technical issues of the early internet because the internet had so much pull, even if in just the form of pure entertainment and wonder. Personally, bitcoin has pulled me in, like you, but will it draw the masses in? Speculation pulls people in right now, but is that what will pull the masses in?

So I guess my response would be that Bitcoin will not kill the state (even though I\'d like it to), at least not by itself.  The state\'s real source of power is not its control over money (although that\'s important). Its real source of power is the widespread (and in my view, misguided) belief in its legitimacy.  Even if Bitcoin were to see massive mainstream adoption, the state will still have 9,000 different ways to collect revenue and sniff out "tax cheats" (obligatory scare quotes ;)).  What Bitcoin *may* do is shift the balance of power back towards the individual somewhat when it comes to financial freedom and privacy.

The NaS  problem is more than just being able to stake on two chains at once. It also relates to being able to relatively easily to create forks.\n\nBy changing the stake modifier at ever block (if I\'m understanding correctly the internals of blackcoin) it makes it very difficult to calculate the exact time of the next proof of stake, making it difficult to make a long chain of dishonest or malicious blocks. After a dishonest node\'s first block propagates, honest nodes that are rightly next in line for the next stake are highly likely to "cut in line" and prevent a forking of the blockchain, which is what NaS is primarily concerned with.\n\nOf course, this isn\'t a "cryptographic" or "100% without a doubt" way of completely preventing any problem, but almost the entirety of [Bitcoin\'s issues and theoretical attacks](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Weaknesses) are not directly related to cryptography, but rather how blocks are generated and propagate.
