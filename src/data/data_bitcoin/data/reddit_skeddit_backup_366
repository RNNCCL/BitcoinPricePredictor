Why does that matter? Mainly, principle. Bitcoin is the original, and hence only legitimate, cryptocurrency, legitimacy defined by the market, i.e. its 90% share of the cryptocurrency market cap. Projects that deviate from Bitcoin (altcoins) are not pure at heart, in terms of improving what already exists; rather, their developers feel like they missed the Bitcoin boat and so seek profit by instead attempting to blatantly clone or reinvent the \'wheel\' (wheel = Bitcoin). I\'m not saying every single altcoin fits this mold, but the vast, vast majority do.\n\nSo with Augur and all such altcoin-based projects, I feel there is just some sort of fundamental dishonesty and obfuscation at play.

Our reputation has led to a market-leader like Coinbase [naming Augur](https://blog.coinbase.com/2015/07/15/bitcoin-trends-in-1h-2015/) as one of the most exciting projects in 2015. We share this distinction with 21, Streamium, Blockstream and Abra, who are seen as legitimate and trusted throughout this industry. \n\nI have no problem that you support and  promote a similar project, I have a massive problem with your strategy of accusing us of being a scam with absolutely no proof. You further this by taking a subtle dig on how we have promoted what we are doing and the success we have had in doing so, which does nothing positive for anyone involved.

This would be p (the amount the user stands to lose by reporting dishonestly) + some epsilon that would reward them more than just reporting honestly.  Now to commit credibly the worst case loss for a reporter you need to be able to commit a value p equivalent to all of their reputation score + some epsilon.  Let\'s assume epsilon is small and just disregard it to make things simple.  At a case with high contention (i.e. 51% vs 49%) the 49% group loses almost all of its score.  So to commit credibly in case the bribe didn\'t actually succeed, you\'d have to commit to ~49% of the reputation in a system, practically, a 51% attack.\n\nIf you could do this with only 500k, it\'d work.  But since rep would be valued at future cash flow from trading fees discounted for time value of money, it\'d likely cost much more than 500k.\n\nIf this is unclear, I\'ve pasted Vitalik\'s comments on the subject below as well which has a slightly different wording.\n\n>"At the limit, where slightly over 50% of votes are in favor of one outcome and 50% in favor of the other, the entire deposit it taken away from minority voters. This ensures that the attack still works, but the bribe must now be greater than the deposit (roughly equal to the payout divided by the discounting rate, giving us equal performance to the infinite-round game) rather than just the payout for each round. Hence, in order to overcome such a mechanism, one would need to be able to prove that one is capable of pulling off a 51% attack"': 2, 'The Augur Alpha is currently available and we are asking users to submit feedback so we can identify and fix as many bugs as possible.\n\nWe have tried to be as open as possible regarding the development timeline and are currently planning to have the Reputation crowdsale two weeks after the Ethereum Frontier release (although this is always subject to change).\n\nIf you have any questions or concerns regarding any specifics on the development process please feel free to contact us on the website, twitter or slack and we can clarify anything you may need to know.': 9, "Exactly why we're using a market scoring rule": 2, 'Alright so when is it ready?': 9, '> Should you begin to be used as an oracle there will be significant financial stake in making the prediction market lie\n\nThere\'s significant financial stake in making the oracle system lie without it being used as an oracle system for other contracts...

Your statement is orthogonal.  \n\n>  making the market lie will be a simple attack\n\nNo more simple than a 51% attack on any distributed consensus system. [referring to the oracle system here].  \n\nMaking a "market lie" is completely different than fudging the outcomes, for an example of this, look at the intrade romney obama market for a few hours in the 2012 election when romney\'s campaign bought some shares.  \n\n> but have never given any indication of how you would go about securing your project\'s side chain\n\nI have, but you haven\'t paid attention.

A decentralized system can report indeterminate, push back to next batch of reporting (i.e. reporting period) and determine the outcome.\n\n> Blockchains route right around these. This still doesn't address the problem of liquidity.\n\nWell, for one, a decentralized PM also means the first truly global PM (i.e. betfair isn't a global market, and nor was intrade), which means more liquidity.\n\nAnother benefit of decentralizing is that the market can decide what markets it wants to make (since anyone can create a market).  \n\nIf there were a global PM with no counterparty risk and the ability to create your own markets, well, I wouldn't be building augur.\n": 3, 'And Augur is based on Truthcoin.

After working on it a bit, these changes are straightforward, but remarkably tedious.\n\nTedium isn\'t a deal-breaker, of course.  The bigger issue is that Bitcoin\'s source code didn\'t offer any real advantages.
