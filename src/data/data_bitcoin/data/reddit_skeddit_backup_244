If it costs less, then there would be additional miners until it is no longer profitable.\n\nOn the other hand, the recent Litecoin halving showed that either litecoin mining is unusually profitable for most miners or that many litecoin miners mine at a loss. If Bitcoin is similar, then the above estimate is not accurate.': 3, "Well, the difference is the more investment in gold mining, the more gold that is produced.\n\nBitcoin miners are all competing for the 3,600 bitcoins per-day issued (at current difficulty level).\n\nSo Bitcoin mining cost is roughly the value the coins mined.  It could be a little more than value of the mined coins (when miners mine at a loss, when taking into consideration the cost of the capital for the mining hardware)  or a little less.   But generally mining will increase in size until there is no more profitability.\n\nSo at $295/bitcoin the cost of mining is about $1M per day, or nearly $400M per year.  \n\nNow to use some more specifics, currently the amount of hashing occuring is 450996 TH/s (per BitcoinWatch).  If all mining were done with the relatively efficient Antminer S7s (which do 4.86 TH/s each), then there would need to be 92,798 of them mining.  Each unit consumes 1,210W, or 29kWh per day.    At the U.S. average residential power cost of $0.12 per kWh means the power consumption is $323,382 just in electricity.   That's $118M in electricity per year.  With each device costing $1,800 that's a capital outlay of ~$167M.   Give that an 24 month useful lifespan, then ~$84M goes to capity + $118M in electricity totals ~$202M per-year \n\nNow that $202M is about half the $400M of revenue (at current exchange rate levels), but I made a few assumptions that are incorrect. Not all mining is occurring with chips as efficient as what the Antminer S7 uses.   That's why difficulty isn't higher today.  Expect it to rise after S7s (and other equally efficient chips) ship.     Also, two year lifespan is, historically, way too long.  These units produce something like 80% of their production in the first year -- when difficulty continues to rise at its current pace.   So that adds to the first-year cost.\n\nEnd result mining cost rises to be about the level of the revenue.   ~$400M (at the current exchange rate).": 2, 'A guess is $150-200 per Bitcoin': 1}, ('Digital Currency Pyramid Scheme Operators Jailed in Spain', 1): {}, ('Ukraine Becomes CIS\xe2\x80\x99s Bitcoin & Blockchain Leader', 0): {}, ('AlphaPoint Rolls Out Blockchain Tool For Banks', 4): {}, ('1 BTC stuck on iphone', 0): {'I see, only option then is to wait for Blockchain.info to work again for you.': 1, 'In the meantime, use Airbitz.

E.g. put arm around shoulder and in a soothing voice say something like "come on, let me demonstrate how this works in the real world.  it\'s free money, do you like free money?  [yes] you can use this same virtual money to buy things at (insert something cousin likes) using gyft or purse.io.  do you ever do shopping online? [yes] then you would LOVE this app.  may i have your phone, I will install the app for you and show you how to get started [more willing to say okay]" demonstrate by handing cousin *your phone*.  then you, not letting her phone out of your control until the demo is over, you say "tada!" and show her the transaction.  Immediately you send the funds back minus some free getting started coin.  Hand her back the phone only after the first confirmation. I guarantee that is a sale and next time op sees cousin she would have more bitcoin.\n\nCome on, sales is just as easy as getting laid.  ': 4, "To what degree did she understand what was going on?

Another way of saying this is that there are more GBTC holders today willing to sell at the equivalent of a ~$280 coin than there are BTC owners willing to sell at the equivalent of a $290 coin.\n\nPlus, and this is probably the best advice I can give someone interested is that it looks like the average volume is under 3k for GBTC.

For example, I have given money Wikipedia. However, I have recently come to doubt if even that is a good idea:\n\nHere is a quick list of some criticisms: http://mywikibiz.com/Top_10_Reasons_Not_to_Donate_to_Wikipedia\n\nHere is a longer story about Linda Mack = SlimVirgin, that illustrates the kind of madness that goes on at Wikipedia: http://www.geocities.ws/berletwatch/virgin.htm \n\nIt looks like Wikipedia is dying a slow death because the editors of Wikipedia are an exclusive and dwindling club due to editorial wars shunning experienced editors and making the barrier high for new ones: http://i.imgur.com/0FdlO0o.png\n\nThere is probably a lot more both praise and criticism of Wikipedia out there, but  maybe I'm just wearing a tin-foil hat. I used to think that Wikipedia was a straight up good place to donate, but I'm no longer fully convinced of that. I have gone from Wikipedia-supporter to Wikipedia-neutral. Looking into criticisms about Wikipedia will make your head explode, as everything circles over these minute details leading ever further until you just give up.\n\nYes Wikipedia has still been pretty useful for me even though it might be highly deficient on many topics (how would I ever have time to research that on every single topic?). So the question is if they really are a net-benefit, or if they are just a website with a collection of simple facts that you can get from other websites, and the rest is descending into a politically charged shitstorm so severe that almost no-one wants to contribute anymore.\n\nAnd that is the case with so many charities out there, exactly *how* am I supposed to **really know**?\n\nMy point is that when I set out to help other people, **I better be damn sure I'm not in reality being used as a tool to serve some other purpose or inflict net harm** - because I know that is the bias that has been exploited in so many people who *want to help* others (**socialism is a good example**, the movie *The Soviet Story* shows how *helping* the workers can *easily turn into eugenics* in one form or another because what you are fundamentally trying to do is to change other people into becoming something else). \n\nMostly I think like this to minimize the risk of inflicting harm instead of helping: \n\n=I give money to people whom I know personally and can ask questions about what they are going to do with the money - they could still be trying to trick me, but I believe that a majority of humans will not lie to someone they know personally when being interrogated thoroughly *and* have answers to probing questions without being bothered or *seem like they are lying*.\n\n=I just give money directly to people whom I believe could use it.\n\n=That I myself just help people I meet by doing something that helps them.\n\n=That I look out for my own self interest, but also try to not harm others but be helpful, so that if it is harmful by mistake, at least *someone* is benefiting.\n\nOtherwise, I believe the EFF might be a good charity - but maybe I'm na\xc3\xafve. eDRI looks like they are supposed to be fighting for good causes (and giving voice to arguments that are seldom herd in Brussels and sorely needed, but I can't find much information about them).

Never reuse an address if you can reasonably avoid it.': 2, 'Currently the majority of transactions are reused addresses. Here is a chart (sorry I don\'t remember the source): https://i.imgur.com/BrmFaBZ.png\n\nIt is considered bad practice to reuse an address, because it has the potential to make it more traceable in the future. But it is my opinion that if our goal is anonymous transactions we need to address that in different ways. Even without reuse it isn\'t hard to track sources. For example the other day I was digging into the payouts of Purse.io (after the email compromise). Each time they process a withdrawal they send the change to a new address. It isn\'t difficult at all to follow that chain and tell they are all from the same source. It may make it a tad bit harder for manual reading of the blockchain by a person but any simple programmed script can put these together in a snap. So I can easily put together a pool and tell that bitcoin came from Purse.io.\n\nAdditionally some use cases are still difficult without reusing addresses. For example as an average user if I want to put a donation address up anywhere it is way more complex to build a safe system to generate individual addresses. The easiest safe way, and the way I would recommend in that scenario, is to setup a Trezor or offline wallet and paste a public address wherever you want.\n\nI wouldn\'t go crazy over never reusing an address. If you can use wallets or practices that easily avoid it, then great, but if not it\'s fine. Bitcoin, as it is currently built, is not designed for anonymous transactions. It is actually the opposite, it is designed for every transaction to be 100% public. Things that are being layered on top of Bitcoin like Coinjoin *help* with anonymity, but to truly achieve that it will need to be addressed at the protocol level itself.\n\nBitcoin is hard enough for new users as it is, trying to impose more "rules" on them for a supposed benefit is just making the curve harder. I disagree with those in this community that tell new users "ppfffff never reuse addresses, you are hurting us all, oh you don\'t have to put one public address up, get a server with PHP".
