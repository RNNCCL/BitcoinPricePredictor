Essentially, a cartel can enforce a soft-fork which specifies minimal fees.\n\nSo I believe the following scenario is more likely: no block size limit -> fees are too small -> miners create a cartel to protect their investment -> cartel enforces a soft fork -> Bitcoin is more centralized.": 1, "Whether such an action would be an 'attack' is debatable.  The mechanism might be the same as hostile miners would use, but the goals of the cartel and the effects of the action must be considered.

If the cartel abused that power and began to truly over charge for their services, users would probably defect to an alt-coin of some sort.": 2, "Good point.

As long as the cartel had more than 50% of the hash power, they could choose to exclude blocks from miners that did not follow cartel protocol, orphaning them.  Realistically the cartel would need some super-majority of hash power to be effective.  I am convinced that this will eventually come to pass, and I don't think it will be a bad thing.

Maybe some desperate sap comes along and can't make it to the next station and buys a few ounces, but it's not going to work for him.\n\nYou also have where different miners have different marginal costs.  It happens that large miners will generally have lower costs of including smaller fee transactions, thus giving them an even bigger advantage, increasing mining centralization.\n\nMining centralization is problematic because it leads to a system where it is easy to censor transactions, even to the point where miners could exclude smaller miners who avoid such censorship through a 51% attack.": 2, 'Please send any literature to that effect.

Spontaneously behaving like a good socialist when nobody's looking?": 1, '>So, would fees necessarily go all the way to zero?\n\nFees would never go all the way to zero (even with infinite blocksizes) because there is some small cost that the miners pay to include a transaction - that is: every transaction in the block makes it a little bit bigger, which means it will propogate through the network a little slower, which slightly increases the likelihood that it will be orphaned. This of course does not mean a generous miner couldn\'t still include zero-fee transactions - but it does mean that he would be hurt by doing so (via increased orphan rate), and if you generated a zero-fee transaction you would likely have to wait a very long time for it to get confirmed by a weirdly generous miner.  \n\n>couldn\'t this be made to work with fixed fees only?\n\nNot necessarily - if block size was completely uncapped, a malevolent miner could launch a sort of "blockchain bloat" attack, where he mines huge blocks full of spam transactions he generated himself (so he gets go keep all of the txn fees).  Although these blocks would propagate slowly through the network, they could still be incorporated into the blockchain and could cause a rapid increase in the size of the blockchain. This miner would of course lose money acting in this way (mining huge blocks that would be often orphaned), but it just shows that if the blockchain wasn\'t capped at all you could open the door to new types of attacks. ': 4, 'Cf. overfishing.\n\nIf there is a single entity doing all the fishing, it can easily choose to do fishing in a sustainable way, so that long-term profits are maximized.\n\nBut if there are many fishing operations, they need to coordinate to prevent overfishing. They need to impose quotas, control fishing, enforce them. Otherwise, if somebody fishes too much, it affects everyone the next year if fish stocks are not replentished.\n\nAs you probably know, overfishing is a thing. It\'s not always possible to impose quotes. Even more so with Bitcoin miners (mining pools) who can choose to be anonymous.\n\nThe whole point of mining is security against double-spend attacks. Yes, competition can \'drive down fees to the equilibrium between what people are willing to pay, and what miners are willing to include", but that equilibrium might be too low.\n\nThere is a simple formula: a cost of making a block approximately equals average reward per block. This comes from a fact that mining is competitive and difficulty is self-adjusting.\n\nSo if fees are driven down to the point where miners collect 1 BTC per block, it would cost one 6 BTC to make 6 blocks to do a 6-confirmation double spend attack. Thus it might be unsafe to accept 10 BTC payment with only 6 confirmations, let alone 100 BTC payment...\n\nIt comes down to economic incentives: mining fees will be a tiny fraction of what miners can earn by assisting double-spends, thus  double-spending becomes more economically viable.': 1, "Back in the days, some pools decided not to include satoshidice txs. Its not really effective as the majority believed they're still financial txs, but in this case spam is spam, we might be able to agree to exclude some tx pattern and keep fee and blocksize low for a little while ": 1, "Well, it's not quite that simple - the larger the block that a miner publishes, the longer it takes to propagate through the network.
