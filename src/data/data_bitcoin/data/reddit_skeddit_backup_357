All great things must be new at some point."\n\nMan, I see this argument amongst *all* altcoiners, even Litecoiners! Don\'t you guys see the issue with this statement? First of all, Monero is not "new" -- it has been on the open market for years already, and yet still has its tiny 5 million USD market cap. Second, back to my original point, all altcoiners see Bitcoin\'s rise from nothing to worth billions of USD and then without fail think "Oh look! Bitcoin did it, so our [insert altcoin here] will also do it. Bitcoin was nothing at one point, but now look at it!".\n\nWhat you guys miss is that Bitcoin was a novel idea -- the first cryptocurrency in the market, which is why it appreciated in value as powerfully as it did, attracting all the factors of its network effect in the process like a massive dragnet. Altcoins, by comparison, by and large add nothing truly revolutionary over Bitcoin. This includes Monero, for the reasons I\'ve given in my posts so far; sorry, it\'s just not significant, and it\'s further lessened in significance by the fact that Bitcoin already has a degree of privacy (via pseudonymity + coinjoin), and that it is actively further increasing its privacy as time goes on.\n\nEthereum literally seems like the only possible altcoin with developers (or should I say 1 developer, Vitalik) who have the ambition and the funding and the mindshare that could realistically gain any significant market share, by creating a truly revolutionary product. Even in that case though, there are all kinds of obstacles it faces in its path forward. Unrelated to those obstacles, but even Ethereum does not view its coin (ether) as a true competitor to Bitcoin; those guys, too, defer to Bitcoin as the future currency and store of value.\n\nMore on this idea of network effect and kind of a \'juggernaut\' characteristic, I\'d like to show you something else. Blockstream, a Bitcoin company that raised a couple tens of million USD in funding late last year, specifically has its goal to maintain and enhance Bitcoin\'s network effect and dominance. This is literally the reason the company was created, lol, and was explicitly stated in the lead investor\'s public statement (a billionaire with net worth of $4.7 billion in 2015, Hoffman, who personally invested rather than investing as part of some group), who also dropped a line highlighting his respect for the company\'s co-founder\'s privacy background (hint hint):\n> While these alt.coins create interesting new possibilities, Bitcoin is the platform where users, merchants, and entrepreneurs are congregating. It\xe2\x80\x99s where the momentum is. **That\xe2\x80\x99s why it\xe2\x80\x99s so important to promote development efforts that increase the power and flexibility of Bitcoin Core, and to do so in a way that keeps Bitcoin open, accessible to all users and developers, a public good.**\n\n> **In pursuit of this public good, I have personally invested in a start-up called Blockstream.** After extensive discussion with my partners at Greylock, we decided this approach was the best way to achieve our long-term goals for the project. In this instance, **the first objective is to increase the public good by strengthening the overall openness and functionality of the Bitcoin ecosystem through \xe2\x80\x9csidechains\xe2\x80\x9d technology.

For all intents and purposes, Bitcoins value floats, Dollars don't. \n\n**Getting Started**\n\nI would first look at something like Coinbase.com or Bitpay.com to handle your transactions. Coinbase for example lets you choose how much of the incoming Bitcoin is insta-converted into USD and sent right to your bank account. So you can choose how much or how little you use either currency. These companies specialize in handling these things for businesses. Many platforms now have options for Bitcoin, like Shopify (several choices of processor), Wordpress has plugins to integrate, and several others. Ive really liked Shopify myself, which is stupid easy to set up for both currencies. Coinbase also has an easy-button creator that is simple to insert into a website if you only have a couple products.

Only having used Coinbase myself, I would recommend it. \n\nCoinbase.com\nBitpay.com\ncoinpayments.net\ngocoin.com\n\nFor taxes, I would start here - http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Virtual-Currency-Guidance, then speak to a licensed accounting professional (good practice for any business).\n\n_____\n\nOtherwise it is difficult to cover every base here, but one step that cannot be missed is simply educating yourself, because if you don't understand it at least sort of, neither will your customers. \n\nhttps://bitcoin.org/en/getting-started\n\nhttps://www.trybtc.com/ (bitcoin simulator!)\n\nOf course, ask questions!

Decentralization empowers individual participants in the network or marketplace. Some may use the protocol in ways that others consider immoral or that are illegal in some jurisdictions. That should, however, not prevent us from creating an open protocol. TCP/IP and HTTP, for instance, allow content to be shared between any two people who have access to the Internet. Some of that content is morally reprehensible to many if not most people. Some of that content is illegal. Still overall, most would argue that society is better off because the Internet has enabled everyone to connect and communicate. The Internet could have been designed to centralize control, but then it would not have enabled the permissionless innovation that led to so many of the services we now use every day. The OpenBazaar protocol makes the same conscious design choice. It is inherently decentralized. It favors innovation over control, so it is possible that the openness of the protocol could lead to use cases that some or most of us would disagree with. But as with TCP/IP and HTTP, we believe the creative and legitimate use cases will quickly dominate the marketplace.": 26, 'There are many great wallets on the iphone that in fact already have "applesq UI":) \n\nOpen Bazaar shouldn\'t take that long to catch up.

That said, it can be done manually or with a script using bitcoin-tx  (comes with bitcoin core).\n\nYou then can use bitcoin-cli to get an output to redeem, however your script can use any client you prefer to get the outpoint, not only bitcoin-cli.\n\n    bitcoin-cli listunspent\n    ...\n    "txid": "e79001d20f5cb4b7186901f32cafaf6ad54bac08c1bd978ddbd270011f352513",\n    "vout": 17,\n    "amount": 0.21196000,\n    ...\n\nThen you get the address the auto renewal service (Reddit) wants you to pay to. In this example reddit gives you the address n12Vgto27V11qtEsaeSDhk9QkDnT5ofc4n.  Also, Reddit wants you to renew on Aug 22.

Step one, create an empty tx\n\n    bitcoin-tx -create\n    01000000000000000000\n\nStep two, add a redeemed output using "bitcoin-tx currentTx in=TXID:VOUT"\n\n    bitcoin-tx 01000000000000000000 in=e79001d20f5cb4b7186901f32cafaf6ad54bac08c1bd978ddbd270011f352513:17 \n    01000000011325351f0170d2db8d97bdc108ac4bd56aafaf2cf3016918b7b45c0fd20190e71100000000ffffffff0000000000\n\nStep three, add a pay-to-address output. The input amount is 0.21196000, so I will pay 0.20000000 to reddit and pay 0.01196000 in miner fees. The format of this command is "bitcoin-tx currentTx outaddr=VALUE:ADDRESS".

This would be similar to charging to your credit card. You can "cancel" the renewal by spending the output before your renewal time comes.\n\nOnce again, this isn\'t me claiming that this is easy to do, I am only saying that lack of implementation is the reason this isn\'t being done already.

That is the only option to regain sovereignty and dignity.': 1, 'Text below, my emphasis.\n\nAlexis Tsipras should never have hired Yanis Varoufakis as his finance minister. Or he should have listened to him, and kept him on. But instead the Greek prime minister chose the worst of all options. He followed Mr Varoufakis\xe2\x80\x99 advice of rejecting the offer of the creditors \xe2\x80\x94 until last week. But having done this, Mr Tsipras committed a critical error by rejecting Mr Varoufakis\xe2\x80\x99 plan B for the moment when the country\xe2\x80\x99s banks closed down: the immediate introduction of a parallel currency \xe2\x80\x94 IOUs issues by the Greek state but denominated in euros. A parallel currency would have allowed the Greeks to pay for their daily transactions when cash withdrawals were limited to \xe2\x82\xac60 a day. A total economic collapse would have been avoided.\n\nBut Mr Tsipras did not go for this, or indeed any other plan B. Instead he capitulated. At that point, he was no longer even in a position to choose a Grexit \xe2\x80\x94 a Greek exit from the eurozone. The economic precondition for a smooth departure would have been a primary surplus \xe2\x80\x94 before debt service \xe2\x80\x94 and an equivalent surplus in the private sector. Greece has no foreign exchange reserves. If the Greeks were to reintroduce the drachma, they would have had to pay for all of their imports with the foreign exchange earnings of their exports. These minimum preconditions were in place in March but not in July.\n\nSo, like his predecessors, Mr Tsipras ended up with another very lousy bailout deal. And this one suffers from the same fundamental flaws as its predecessors. This leads me to conclude that Grexit remains the most likely ultimate outcome after all.\n\nThere are three principal ways in which this can happen. The first is that a deal is simply not concluded. All that was agreed last week is for negotiations to start, plus some interim financing. A deal might fail because principal participants themselves are sceptical. Wolfgang Sch\xc3\xa4uble, the German finance minister, says he will keep up his offer of a Grexit in his drawer, just in case the negotiations fail. Mr Tsipras denounced the agreement on several occasions last week. And the International Monetary Fund is telling us that the numbers do not add up, and that it will not sign unless the European creditors agree to debt relief.\n\nThe Germans refuse any discussion on this subject, citing some trumped-up rules according to which eurozone countries are not allowed to default. This is legal hogwash, but I suppose the purpose is to describe new red lines in the negotiations.\n\nMy hunch is that they will ultimately fudge a deal, but that will come \xe2\x80\x94 as it always does \xe2\x80\x94 with overwhelming collateral damage: less debt relief than needed, and more austerity than Greece can bear.\n\nA more likely Grexit scenario is that a programme is agreed and then fails. The Athens government may implement all the measures the creditors demand, but the economy fails to recover and debt targets remain elusive. Mr Tsipras already agreed last week that if this situation arose, he would pile on more austerity. So, unless the economy behaves in future in a very different way from the way it behaved in the past, it will remain trapped in a vicious circle for many years to come. At that point, Mr Tsipras, or his successor, could concede defeat and opt for a negotiated Grexit as the least painful option. Grexit could also be forced on them by the creditors.\n\n**My own most likely Grexit scenario is a different one yet again. Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, hinted at this in his interview with the Financial Times last week when he said that he felt \xe2\x80\x9csomething revolutionary\xe2\x80\x9d in the air. He is on to something. The most probable scenario for me is Grexit through insurrection. Give it another three years, and I would not be surprised to see Mr Tusk and his colleagues in the European Council having to entertain even more drastic action to quell a crisis.**\n\nGreece is not quite at the point of insurrection yet \xe2\x80\x94 despite eight years of recession. Opinion polls still reflect a majority of the people in favour of keeping the euro. In real life people choose between a small number of political alternatives and settle for the one they think works best for the economy. They voted for Mr Tsipras and his Syriza party in January because the other parties failed to deliver. If Syriza fails to deliver, too, as it surely will, the Greeks will have no democratic choices left.\n\nCan Mr Tsipras still avert disaster? If there is a snap election in the autumn, he might well win it and then revive Mr Varoufakis\xe2\x80\x99 parallel currency idea at some point. But I think the parallel currency moment has gone with the man. My hunch is that Mr Tsipras will run a rabble-rousing political campaign, with a lot of rhetoric against the creditors but then agree to whatever the creditors are demanding, and follow the programme to its dramatic climax.': 1}, ('Torsten Hoffman on Documentary Filmmaking, Monetary History, and "Bitcoin: The End of Money As We Know It"', 10): {"This was a really enjoyable discussion on the movie and the details of the creative process behind it.
