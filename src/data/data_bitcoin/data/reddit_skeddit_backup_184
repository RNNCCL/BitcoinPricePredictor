{'12-08-2015': {('Please Help Me Understand BitCoins', 3): {'There\'s a number of ways to think about Bitcoin.  The easiest way is to think of it as a commodity, like gold, but that is on the computer, and even though it\'s on the computer and can be transfered via the internet, it still has the non-computer property of not being able to be copied.  So when somebody sends you bitcoins, you actually have a real tangible asset, NOT a digital copy of something.\n\nThe way that all works, and the reason the commodity Bitcoin has value, is the protocol behind Bitcoin, aka the blockchain.  Bitcoin is not backed by anything -- you can\'t just go trade them in for dollars or gold.  People *do* trade them for that because they believe Bitcoin has value.  But that value is completely self-derived.\n\nI personally believe that value comes from the usefulness of that blockchain technology and how it works -- the fact that it enables payments and data to be moved without being "copied".  Other people think it\'s valuable for other reasons, and some people think it\'s not valuable at all and we\'re all fools for believing in it.\n\nThe difficult thing for understanding Bitcoin in every way but the price/value aspects, is that, in terms of the technology and how it works, everything is all mixed together into one thing, and so it\'s often difficult to separate them when you\'re talking about Bitcoin.\n\nAs for being safe -- well that depends on how good you are with your security.  People get hacked all the time.  And since Bitcoin is an actual commodity on your computer (that\'s not technically true, but it\'s the easiest way to think about it) -- since it\'s actually on your computer, if you get hacked and lose it, it\'s really gone.  There\'s no way to get it back, no government or insurance company that will refund you.  It\'s just gone.  Some people like to store their money with other people, like exchanges like Coinbase or Bitstamp, and trust that those institutions will not lose them, or at least that they can be sued if they do lose them.  Some people print out the data that represents the Bitcoins onto pieces of paper and then delete the Bitcoin from their computer, so now they have Bitcoin in the physical world, on pieces of paper, protected from computer hacking.\n\nAnd some other people use a neat optional property of Bitcoin that makes it so multiple people must agree on how the Bitcoin is spent in order for it to move at all, so if any one of them is hacked, the Bitcoin is still safe.\n\nAs for it\'s value... that\'s just what one person is willing to buy and another is willing to sell for.  There is no "official" value.  The way I determine the "actual" value is I go look at a bunch of exchanges and take the average of the price that people traded it for most recently.  Most recently, that was about $410.\n\nAs for buying it, there are government-licensed exchanges like Coinbase and Bitstamp and Gemini, and there are unlicensed exchanges, and there are forums where people just agree to meet and trade in person -- there\'s pretty much every way you can imagine.  The difficulty most people have is that people who sell Bitcoin will usually not let you use a credit card or Paypal to buy from them.  The reason is really simple -- they buy the Bitcoin, then once they have the Bitcoin, they call their credit card company or e-mail Paypal and say "that wasn\'t me, that was a hacker or identity thief, please reverse that charge", and the company *does* reverse it, and now the seller is out the Bitcoin and the credit card or paypal payment.  (And often times, it really *was* a hacker that stole their info, and used that to get Bitcoins.)  Bitcoins trades cannot be reversed.  Think of it like using cash on the street -- once you give it to somebody it\'s gone.  So either the person you trade with, like most in person traders, will only accept cash, or they are big companies/exchanges and require all kinds of identifying documents.\n\nDon\'t feel bad -- Bitcoin is overwhelming and hard to understand.  And it\'s hard to get any, and it\'s hard to learn how it works.  That\'s all just a function of it still being relatively new.  Watch the videos other people have posted, read forums, keep asking questions, and little by little you\'ll get more and more knowledgeable.': 1, "You should start by reading the sidebar.

Circle is a personal payment app, and not an Exchange or Bitcoin Wallet, for which there are many good products and services out there.\n\nWith Circle, by default your account is denominated in USD.  You can instantly send or receive payments from your bank account via your debit card, for free, between users.  That piece is a substitute (a more secure and private one) for something like Venmo.\n\nYou can also convert to other currencies, instantly, for free.  Right now we natively support USD and BTC currencies, which you can store with us.  BTC stored with us and is fully-insured from theft.  You can change your currency at any time in the app settings.\n\nHowever, the primary way that most customers would interact with bitcoin using Circle is by sending a payment to a bitcoin address.  When you send money in the circle app, you can send to an email address, phone number or bitcoin address.  If you are holding USD, or sending USD from your debit card using the circle app, and you send to a bitcoin address, we instantly convert from USD into BTC and transmit and settle the transaction on the bitcoin blockchain network.\n\nThe opposite is also true -- from the circle app you can get your address and QR code (these change dynamically) and someone can send you a payment over the bitcoin network at that address, and when it's received it's instantly converted into USD and stored with Circle.  You can Cash Out to your bank account or bank debit card at any time for free.\n\nSo, to answer your question more directly -- if you want to buy and hold and possibly use Bitcoin, in Circle's app settings just convert your currency from USD to BTC and you'll just be able to buy/sell/hold and use bitcoin on its own.  If your goal is to pay for something using bitcoin but you don't care to hold or have to have a separate bitcoin-only balance, you can just send USD to any bitcoin address instantly, straight from your debit card or circle balance.\n\nHope that's helpful.\n\nJeremy\n": 2, 'you can send USD to any bitcoin address.  if you want to store value in BTC, convert to BTC in your settings.  depends on your use-case (savings/investment - hold/buy/sell BTC OR spending / making payments - hold USD, send over bitcoin network)': 1, 'There should be a "buy Bitcoin" button somewhere in your Circle account, if you click on that and buy whatever amount you want it will be put into your Circle wallet which you can then use to buy with or send to another wallet.\n\nHere\'s a good video presentation on Bitcoin 101:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/E83gnS-EJ94\n\n': 1, 'Circle allows you to hold either USD or BTC, sounds like you have it set to USD.
