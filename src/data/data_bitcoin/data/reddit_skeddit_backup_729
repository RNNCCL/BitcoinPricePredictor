It is unbelievable what was achieved with bitcoin already and still there is promise for much more in the future, the technology is simply incredible.

Didn't mean for it to come across that way.

There will be national side effects in the short term that we\'re aware of, but there will also be global consequences that are hard to predict.\n\nThe world\'s currencies are interrelated, and actions of devaluing/revaluing is equal to changing parameters in a massive, international differential equation. Repercussions...\n\nThere are a couple of other reasons why I believe in bitcoin:\n\n* Banks are making it their multi-billion dollar business to impede instant money transfers. It\'s called floating, and as long as banks have that sentiment, instant transfers between two persons just won\'t happen on a global scale. FX is big business.\n* It\'s time for the banking industry to be the target of a disruptive technology. Legacy banks of today tend to be run like, and have the structure of, any international company in the 1970s. They\'ve since long forgotten how to innovate since there\'s no need to. While most industry sectors underwent massive changes from a business development perspective during the 80s and 90s (rethinking distribution, outsourcing retail channels, renewed positioning, decreasing vertical expansion), banks never had a reason to. "Innovation" has been limited to acquiring insurance companies. Just the fact that "universal bank" is a term. What other industry areas still have "universal" companies?\n\nI think the block chain, along with its side chains, is that technology, and I think the people will be the winners. To my knowledge, the financial sector never had as many startups and young entrepreneurs engaged as today. Disruptive technologies create jobs, move money, redistribute wealth and bring humanity one more step up the socio-economic ladder.\n\n* I\'m hoping that the transparency that the block chain provides could cast a spotlight at what I think is the single biggest perturbation to democracy: lobbying.': 8, 'How so?': 1, "Its not about getting rid of any other currencies, it will never do that.

Perhaps someone could have lost thousands of other people's bitcoins as a result, perhaps someone could have been killed as a result (e.g. anti-government civil movements in more oppressive parts of the world end up risking their lives to their computer security).\n\nBeing frank about the dangers and risks improves awareness for everyone; and it's the best thing we can do right now to reduce future incidents.

Sorry for making a bit of an example of you there, I think it's regretful.\n\nIn some other fields of engineering where mistakes or ignorance can cause massive losses, or even the loss of life the engineering professions are highly regulated.

Ah, and I see this particular implementation does not fix the totally busted RNG that Electrum had fixed in their fork, so there is that too.\n\nIt\'s also _very_ slow and has high overhead (more than doubles the message size). ... and using some bitcoin key based thing over feature rich, widely reviewed cryptographic software like PGP is of pretty dubious value even ignoring the risks of novel, untested, unreviewed cryptographic software: The applications on the website "Log into websites with encrypted messages -- Speak to financial counterparts as the cryptographically prove owner of certain financial assets. Every message you write proves you own X bitcoins." are all more correctly, efficiently, and securely accomplished with message signing, which is an existing feature of every competent wallet application for year now.\n\nSeriously, cryptography is difficult and requires concentrated review and careful construction. Casual tinkering is likely to cause harm to people, and IMO cryptographic software shouldn\'t ever be offered to the general public without some review by multiple experienced people.

I wonder if they rolled their eyes at the belief that millions of brilliant ideas would come out of opening the world of literature to everyone?\n\nBitcoin and the Internet are part of a natural progression of technology pushing towards greater decentralization and the permeation and utilization of new ideas throughout society.  This is actually the trend of life in general, towards more complexity, higher adaptability, and more decentralized systems of order.  Societal structure is absolutely a technology that has progressed in much the same way.  It is the operating system for interaction between individuals.  The tech we are currently using is outdated, horrifically destructive, imbalanced, and inefficient.  If we continue down this path without change, we won\'t survive.  \n\nBut all the pieces are coming into place for a society that remains decentralized, globally balanced, informed, and adaptive.  And most importantly, power will be *actually* democratically distributed.  We have thousands of examples of decentralized organization and association without hierarchical authority structures all over the Internet and new economies.  Even many software companies are taking these structures because they are so much more efficient and progress occurs much faster.  This is all what is referred to as "crypto-anarchy" and it\'s happening right now within companies, associations, and entire industries.  It is currently testing the 2 last bastions of centralized insanity which are financial and political power.  If you think this massive shift is going to just stop and leave your government intact and using the same slow, stupid, easily corruptible, and incoherent incentives then you are sorely mistaken.  "Crypto-anarchy" will be here whether you think organizing society should be run by a religious or political elite or not, because it won\'t be.  In the same way that the entire modern world has divorced themselves from the idea that their leaders should be chosen by God and birthright and have totalitarian control; so too will the political agency, committee, and voting systems of today be ancient history in short order.  \n\nI\'m sorry to break it to you, but statism is going the way of the fax machine.  Just because you choose not to imagine or consider the implications of cryptographic technology doesn\'t mean everyone else is just as narrow-minded.  If the systems are possible, someone will eventually build them.  Many have already been started, some are already maturing, all of them will eventually exist.  As the billions of impoverished, persecuted, and unheard peoples of the world find their equal voice and freedom of association on the Internet, their economic power in decentralized currency, and their freedom in cryptographic ownership - the torrent of decentralization will wash over government like a minor nuisance.  You may not call it crypto-anarchy, but you will likely live in it all the same.

This is a terrible idea because cash is still the most private and fool proof way of buying bitcoins.  If you abolish cash, then the choke hold tightens and the banks can be major roadblocks to obtaining bitcoins.  Right now, if a bank sees that you are buying, they can close your account, and you can still buy with cash.  Take away the cash, then you've just dried up alternatives.": 8, '>There\'d obviously be a coordination problem here. If a bunch of central banks decided to have negative interest rates and banned cash, and a few countries had positive interest rates and didn\'t ban cash, then people would just start selling the former\'s currency short and buying the latter\'s currency. George Soros style speculative attack which would result in hyperinflation.\n\n\nYou have no idea what you\'re talking about. This has nothing to do with the stunt Soros did. \n\n1) The CBs in this scenario **are not trying to maintain fixed exchange rate**, unlike the BOE. exchange rate remains floating. What speculative attack can you pull? There is nothing to attack. You literally have no idea what soros even did. This comparison is retarded. It\'s not even comparing apples with oranges, its comparing an apple with a car\n\n2) Why the fuck would there even be hyperinflation? Where is the new currency coming from to cause that? People selling your currency cause your currency to depreciate, not hyperinflation. The 2 are not the same thing. Inflation cause currencies to depreciate, but depreciating currency does not necessarily cause inflation, and certainly not hyperinflation. \n\n3) No, people won\'t start selling the former\'s currency short and buying the latter\'s currency. By this reasoning, people would be doing the exact same thing for currencies with different interest rates right now. There isn\'t some magical difference between "0 to negative" and "positive to a lower positive". \n\nCurrencies can have low interest rates **BECAUSE** people want to hold them. Thats why german bond interest rate is so low. Saying people will start dumping currencies when it has negative interest rate is like saying people will start dumping currencies when it has lower interest rate. Thats stupid. If this were the case, people would have taken their money out of german banks and moved them into greece. The more people want to hold your currency, the lower interest rate the CB can go. The fact that CBs cannot go below 0 just sets an arbitary limit on this relationship. As demand increases, the CB should be able to choose to go lower and lower. The fact that they can\'t go lower than 0 even as demand continues to increase is an inefficiency in the system and breaks the relationship between this 2 factors for no good reason whatsoever. The same people that are willing to keep their money at 1% or 0% in germany instead of greece will continue to do so if german banks start charging negative interest. \n\nIf interest rates drop from 3% to 2%, you\'re paying 1% to keep holding that currency after the change. If it goes from 0% to -1%, it\'s the **exact same scenario**. If people arent running from a 1% loss from 5% to 4% and 4% to 3% and 3% to 2%, then they wont run from 0 to -1% or -1% to -2%.
