Galileo never lived to see his work vindicated. I don\'t want Bitcoin to be buried just because people want to pick a fight with the establishment.\n\n> _4. Fighting gives you nothing but martyrdom.\n\nI\'m not interested in making martyrs and a long protracted fight. I want to win NOW, I don\'t want Bitcoin to be pushed to the sidelines and marginalised for the next 2 decades because morons tried to pick a fight with governments and the central banks of the world, who suddenly decided to squash the nuisance that is Bitcoin. Picking a fight with governments is not going to make Bitcoin get adopted faster.\n\nI\'m not interested in the romantic platitudes. That somehow Bitcoin will overthrow governments, that the people will flock to Bitcoin in droves and abandon their old currencies, that there will be riots and bankers will be lined up and led into jail cells while the crowd cheers. It\'s a fantasy.\n\nI want Bitcoin to ruthlessly overthrow the current system and completely route out corruption in the existing financial system, but it needs to find ways to interact with the financial system first, and the only way to do that is to get into the financial system and start setting down roots. I summed it up in another post.\n\n"Embrace, extend and extinguish." -- Microsoft.\n\n> In fact why are you here? Are you here to try to warn the innovators that it\'s not worth trying? How odd is that?\n\nI\'ve followed Bitcoin daily since 2010 and I\'m *trying* to tell people to stop acting like teenagers and think smarter. Stop poking the bear and resorting to this mindless, anti-establishment rhetoric that keeps being bandied about like a broken record. The establishment *can\'t* change Bitcoin and they can\'t stop people using Bitcoin yet they still think it\'s necessary to have an us vs them mindset. People should be encouraging governments, banks, the financial system, businesses etc. to use Bitcoin, not constantly parading Bitcoin as a way to thumb their nose at them.\n\nYou, like everyone else still have this us versus them mindset. You need to break away from that way of thinking and really realise that Bitcoin can\'t be corrupted by any government or financial system, all they can do is regulate around it, and once Bitcoin usage rises to a critical point, no-one will need to use the old system, they\'ll simply use Bitcoin. Governments can\'t touch the inside of the Bitcoin system, not with regulation, judges can\'t order Bitcoin to do anything, neither can presidents. But that can\'t happen until it actually starts to co-exist with banks, governments, stock exchanges, etc.\n\ntl;dr Stop fighting, start integrating.\n\n\n': 2, "I can't believe you cite Galileo as an example - his ideas have clearly succeeded, because they were correct and inspite of his struggles at the time.

But one big problem with this sort of thing is that due to the nature of Bitcoin, this "taint" tends to spread very widely. If a transaction has as input 1 tainted satoshi and 100 untainted BTC, the entire output must be labeled as tainted, since the Bitcoin network doesn\'t keep track of individual satoshi. When a transaction has several inputs, the input coins are truly and inseparably mixed, like gold being melted together. The result is that if the thief sends the money to many different people, in a pretty short time a large percentage of all bitcoins (much more than were actually stolen) will be tainted.\n\nAlso, (even if stolen coins could be effectively traced), if a thief sells stolen coins to Mary, and Mary uses those coins to buy something from Bob, and Bob gives them as a gift to Alice, ... and so on through dozens of people, it\'d be unfair to take the money from whoever ends up having it.\n\nAnd even if the thief is known to control some address, and money from that address is sent directly to an exchange, the exchange can\'t just immediately give that money to victims. It is possible, for example, that the thief is using an EWallet with a shared wallet, and this money was actually sent by someone else. Or the thief could have transferred the money by giving someone the private key, without a Bitcoin transaction (perhaps through several people in completely separate and different transactions as above). This sort of transaction is a strong piece of evidence that *police* can use, but an exchange can never take it upon *itself* to steal and redistribute its customers\' money.': 1, "I sure don't want agencies involved.

Under such a system, all of the satoshi in the first output would become colored. But the rule could also be, "X colored satoshi become colored starting with the last output", resulting in all satoshi in the second output becoming colored. Or "Each output of the transaction gets an equal number of colored satoshi, with any remainder being assigned starting from the first output," resulting in 50 satoshi in the first output and 50 satoshi in the second output becoming colored. Each of these define a valid and usable rule for keeping track of individual satoshi, and a colored coin system could use any of these rules. But Bitcoin itself doesn\'t have a way of tracing a satoshi. Any attempt to do so is an imaginary (but exact and usable) rule applied to Bitcoin transactions.\n\nImagine that you want to trace a particular satoshi. You do so by coloring it with a unique color and seeing which satoshi ends up with the same color. But as I explained above, there is no unique, universal, or objectively-right way of propagating color through the system. Different colored coin systems would say that different satoshi end up colored in the end. So there\'s no unique, objective way to trace individual satoshi.': 3, 'The greatest worry is that if an exchange can choose to reject certain coins, it can also be coerced to reject certain coins.\n\nThe market will discipline voluntary decisions, but the spectre of mandatory blacklists is unsettling.': 3, 'Well, that one we knew about already.': 1, "Goalposts.

The benefits of this outweigh the negatives. The negatives being: consistent downward pressure on the market (though that is partly a positive too, the real-price finding can happen quicker than otherwise due to supply being spread), a perceived (or even real, when people don\'t think it through) obstacle for adoption. Current adoption optimally being "buy an amount you\'re willing to lose and hold" due to the current volatile/early phase of bitcoin among other things.\n\nI\'ll expand on the last thing I said; bitcoin currently fundamentally has obstacles for *useability* adoption, which don\'t have to do with the supply mechanism, but rather with it being "early stage" and the use infrastructure not being complete. In fact, the supply mechanism is sort of like a crutch during this phase in order to get things incentivized, the supply spread and the volatility a little lowered.

Then that message (known as a "transaction") is given a unique ID number and I sign that message using my private key and that message to generate a long string of numbers called a digital signature.\n\nA third party can then take the transaction message I wrote, my signature, and my public key (which is embeded in the message) and verify that I own the private key associated with that public key WITHOUT actually telling them my private key.\n\nOnce this transaction message is seen by a large amount of the computers, it is (mostly) secure.\n\nTo get rid of that "(mostly)", a process called mining takes all the transactions it sees and lumps them into blocks.

Preface: I\'m one of the core developers on [Monero](https://getmonero.org), which some mistakenly believe to be in "competition" with Darkcoin. Nonetheless, I have been involved in the cryptocurrency space for many years, and in cryptography / netsec / FOSS projects far longer, so take these observations accordingly.\n\n1. Darkcoin had a problematic launch: [2 million Darkcoin were mined in the first day](http://i.imgur.com/dSe9cRz.jpg) (incidentally, there are around 2 800 Darkcoin emitted daily right now, so that should give some level of contrast). This may not seem to relate to your question, but it is important to establish the legitimacy and technical competency of the developer. The fact that the [block reward does not match either of the three block reward formulae published by the developer](http://i.imgur.com/1KyeATF.jpg) is worrying. This points to an outright scam at worst, pure incompetence at best.\n\n2. When dealing with a *crypto*currency you need to be able to cryptographically and mathematically prove a particular claim. So in [the original Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) Satoshi was able to mathematically prove the validity of the longest chain rule. The rest of his cryptographic claims were backed by the papers he quotes ([Adam Back\'s Hashcash paper in particular](http://www.hashcash.org/papers/hashcash.pdf)). Darkcoin has no cryptographic proofs of their claims. This is important, because a cryptocurrency is a manifestation of cryptographic theory, not the other way around. If you try and shoe-horn it the other way around you\'ll likely find your model unsafe under [the most basic of assumptions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_model_(cryptography).\n\n3. The developer seems to eschew well-defined, anti-fragile, and proven Bitcoin concepts (eg. building a model based on paying for services via micropayment channels) for bizarre models that are poorly implemented and fragile (eg. payments based on uptime make a MasterNode a ripe target for DDoS attacks null-routing that IP).\n\n4. I have seen no evidence that InstantX transactions are not susceptible to malleability. This means that it is trivially easy to disrupt every InstantX transaction, and the network will fall back to processing them as "normal" transactions.\n\n5. This malleability approach also allows for easy forking of the network if you own a subset of MasterNodes, whereby your malicious MasterNodes vote for both of your transactions and feed those votes to two groups of miners. The claim made in the InstantX "whitepaper" is that the conflicting messages will "cancel each other out", but once the network is forked that isn\'t the case, as half the conflicting messages won\'t even be received by the one part of the forked network. By continuing to run this group of malicious nodes, feeding sets of InstantX transactions that appear to be voted in as valid, you can keep the network split indefinitely.\n\n6. The entire basis for "anonymising" transactions is based on clients being online at a given point in time, which means that those clients are also open to leaking information via temporal association.\n\n7. The developer seems to have a grave lack of understanding when it comes to the danger of incentives. The clearest example of this is [this table of MasterNode ROI](http://darkcoin.guide/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/masternode_payment_plan.png). As you can clearly see, a MasterNode\'s ROI is substantially higher when there are fewer MasterNodes. Thus there is clear incentive for a MasterNode operator to systematically attack and destroy other MasterNodes, but not so much that the network ceases to exist. Just enough to double or triple his ROI. Incidentally, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy, as in a hypothetical future where Darkcoin is processing thousands of transactions an hour it will require quite a hefty server to act as a MasterNode. The fewer MasterNodes there are, the more work individual MasterNodes will have to do, which means that those run by non-technical people or on cheap VPS\'s will be the first to go, eventually leaving a group of big boys with big guns operating the remaining MasterNodes.\n\n8. We\'ve already seen ample evidence of law enforcement turning seemingly anonymous people into informants (eg. Sabu), hacking servers, and infiltrating systems in other ways. It is safe to say that LEA could also outrightly purchase large portions of the MasterNode network. It is impossible to tell which MasterNodes are real and which are owned by LEA (in perpetuity). Unfortunately it appears that the developer\'s line of reasoning, with respects to "how much" privacy Darkcoin gives you, started with the assumption that a supermajority of the MasterNodes are honest / not being watched / not infiltrated by LEA. This leaves open a huge, gaping hole whereby all of the "mixing" MasterNodes are involved in can be revealed by an owned / compromised majority. I can guarantee that the bulk of all MasterNode operators do not know even the first piece of opsec required to keep from your tin from being tampered with.\n\n9. MasterNodes can be tricked into believing they can no longer accept new connections, simply by filling up all their file descriptors. It is somewhat trivial to force new connections to a group of MasterNodes under your control.\n\n10. The developer has no clue how dangerous and stupid it is to chain hashing algorithms, as you open them up to pre-image attacks among other things. As a security researcher who [discovered a flaw in chained hashing algorithms in PHP](http://blog.ircmaxell.com/2015/03/security-issue-combining-bcrypt-with.html) concluded: *"The underlying problem is that combining cryptographic operators that weren\'t designed to be combined can be disastrous. Is it possible to do so safely? Yes. Is it a good idea to do it? No. This particular case is just one example where combining operations can be exceedingly dangerous. But the bottom line: never roll your own crypto. It can have fatal consequences."*\n\nOf course, Darkcoin proponents try reply to comments like these with accusations of "FUD" and nonsensical dismissals that occasionally contain a smattering of hand-waving and technical jargon to try make it appear they know what they\'re talking about. Which I will, understandably, ignore and refuse to engage. Instead, I ask only that the onus remain on Darkcoin to cryptographically and mathematically prove that their model, for all claims, remains valid and secure.\n\nEdit: corrected first point to reflect that 2 million Darkcoin were mined in a day, not in 8 days. I had forgotten that it was instamined due to low diff, it only normalised after many retargets towards the end of the day.

He should have enough incentive, there\'s a 5000 Dollar bounty being drafted up atm.': 5, 'Go do some work on Monero then instead of coming to DRK threads!!! ;)': -1, 'Ok I think that my statement may have been misinterpreted. First off: there\'s no "torrent of attacks", there was a request for a technical response to the ideas in the interview. I listened to the interview, and I focused my response accordingly. I chose not to delve into the danger of "sporks" (which is really just Bitcoin\'s alert-key mechanism twisted into a kill switch with no opt-out) nor the "we\'ll test it in production!" attitude it encourages. I focused only on what is architecturally and technically broken in Darkcoin.\n\nNow to that quote of mine. First off, I said that we\'re not fighting for relevance because, quite frankly, I don\'t know if Monero will be around in 20 years time, and that\'s why I said that in that event both Monero and Darkcoin will just be bootnotes in long-forgotten journals. Cryptocurrency will have descended from Bitcoin, and any mention of the history of cryptocurrency will start with Bitcoin and then go on to the thing that replaced Bitcoin with no mention of the floundering sidebars that existed in its infancy.\n\nI mean, when you read about the history of man landing on the moon you mostly read about the American space race, sometimes with some cold war Russian bits thrown in as background. Do you read about the UK space program? The Chinese? The Germans? Heck, even South Africa had a space program in the 60s that researched solid-fuel rockets till it was shut down under pressure from the US government.\n\nThen fighting for marketcap and investors? We\'re not. In fact, I typically tell [those interested in purchasing Monero not to](http://log.bitcoin-assets.com/?date=11-12-2014#951020), at least not without understanding that it\'s unlikely to make them "profit".\n\nA lot of this attitude is because I\'ve worked on and contributed to open-source projects before, and you can be that "marketcap" and "investors" are not terms bandied about. Yes, the fact that this open source project is "money" changes things, but not so substantially that I lose all moral compass and work ethic. The Monero core team chose to divorce ourselves from investors and "the market" and price a long time ago, specifically when we rejected pressure from "investors" that wanted us to flatten the emission curve (under the guise of us not having chosen it in the first place) - even though such a change would have led to an increase in price due to increase scarcity in the short-term. We refused (and still refuse) to modify our social contract. Our emission curve was set in stone the day we launched, and it *does not change*.\n\nOf course we want "the market", but that\'s not "the marketcap", it\'s "the userbase", for two reasons:\n\n1. It is its own special type of reward when you create something useful, like our [OpenAlias](https://openalias.org) project that any cryptocurrency can use and that has a plugin in Electrum 2.0, and people start using it. To see people eschew long and complicated Bitcoin and Monero and Whatever-coin addresses in favour of donate@getmonero.org or epicenterbitcoin.com and so on...that is a reward in and of itself.\n\n2. The bigger the userbase the more we\'ll get [donations and sponsors](https://getmonero.org/getting-started/donate/), and the more the [many contributors to the project](https://getmonero.org/knowledge-base/people) can spend more time on it.\n\nI know that it\'s hard to believe that we actually care that much about the technology we\'re building, but if you\'ve been involved in open-source projects before our attitude will seem completely natural and not at all surprising.': -1, 'There was no premine and coinmarketcap is very aware of it.

The word chimerical comes to mind if you don't think that is what will happen.": -1, "The semantics are arguable- I'll give you that. \nMaybe someone else in the DRK community can give us an answer to how many coins the developers and friends kept. Possibly the right thing to have done was burn those coins.": -1, '> it is not yet workable, meaning not very user-friendly at all (no gui, and blockchain bloat)\n\nThey\'re 100% right in the sense that it is still a very unpolished project, and there are lots of things we need to do before we can release an "official" GUI (see the development section of our [design and development goals](http://getmonero.org/design-goals/) for more detail on what leads up to the official GUI). That having been said, the ["Choose A Client"](http://getmonero.org/getting-started/choose) page on the Monero website should give you various options, from the dead easy to use [MyMonero](https://mymonero.com) web client, to two open-source third-party GUIs that are in active development. Those may be stop-gap solutions to the release of the official GUI, but they\'re stop-gap solutions filling a need whilst we get Monero\'s foundation truly solid.\n\nBlockchain bloat is a different matter entirely (although any mixing process, Darkcoin\'s included, will "bloat" the blockchain as a natural cost for adding obfuscation). At this stage any reduction in the Monero blockchain that we can introduce will be linear in nature (e.g. allowing nodes to discard old group signatures as a form of pruning). There is active ongoing research by the [Monero Research Lab](https://lab.getmonero.org) into SPV-style wallets (passing bloom filters instead of viewkeys) that don\'t reduce privacy, more efficient signature schemes that can introduce a linear decrease in blockchain size that will make a difference in the long term, and blockchain pruning that keeps just the utxoset / key image set.': -1, 'Why are you replying to technical criticism with non-technical hand waving?
