This is basic economics. Therefore it is crucial to take this into account *now* in order to hopefully have some sort of solution ready when the reserves deplete.\n\nFor Bitcoin it is similar. You're saying fees are only about 0.5% of miners income. Maybe so *now*, but the coinbase reward will vanish in future, we *know* this, so fees will eventually make up 100% of miners income. If the size of a block is still 1MB then, the fees will either have to go up dramatically in order to accommodate the miners, or blockchain security will go down dramatically.

Each of those transactions could be an individual making a genuine purchase or trying to buy, sell, basically trying to use bitcoin as it is meant to be used, and they had to wait hours on end, or even days, for 1 confirmation.\n\nThe thing with fees is that capacity is limited. Let us say that there are a million users each making 1 genuine transaction, thus 1 million transactions in total. Only 200k transactions can go through whatever fee they pay. Even if you pay a fee of 1 million dollars, it is only 200k transactions paying that fee that go through. The other 800k have to wait for hours on end, see their transaction drop out etc. because the capacity is simply capped at 200k and there is nothing they can do about it.\n\nNow lightning is being promised as a saviour.

We are dealing with money here so we shouldn\'t rush things and ignore any bugs that might otherwise not be ignored because of bias or whatever debate is going on. Lightning needs to be fully coded, very tested, security penetrated and even then it should be a choice. Perhaps it\'s final implementation is less secure than bitcoin itself, or maybe less private, or more inconvenient to use...

Since doing so severely compromises your security and opens you up to total financial ruin and devastating heartbreak. Visit a hacked or defaced website that exploits a browser vulnerability and boom you have a keylogger, suddenly your cold wallet is in the hands of a Chinese hacking group that will instantly drain it and leave you high and dry.\n\nIOW the hot wallet - cold wallet paradigm is only going to grow stronger over time.

If you do not think that the powers that be are going through various 'What If' scenarios right now relating to things such as crypto currency getting 'out of control' then you are foolish.

Let me explain:\n\n* If you have greater compute than the rest of the network, you will *on average* beat the rest of the network to mining a block.\n* The greater the epsilon, the greater the chance of winning a given block.  At equality it is 50/50, and it approaches 100% (without ever equaling) the greater the ratio.\n* However, this means that your velocity of block production will be greater than others.\n* Which means block withholding attacks approach certainty.  If you keep a hidden block chain and build, you will eventually exceed the public chain with certainty.\n* The choice of which block to start with is arbitrary.  You can start with the genesis block.  Your percentage chance to exceed public block chain size approaches certainty over time.\n\nI'm really not even certain how you believe only one block can be compromised.  I don't know what misconception gives that.  It's not like the same computing wouldn't then be applied to the subsequent block.  Mining is simply finding a number to put in the block header that allows the block hash to have a specified number of leading zeroes.  The block headers are linked by a previous hash in the header.

So many people that it starts to hurt the value of the USD, and draws the attention of the government to fix it.\n\nWell, people can't just put USD into bitcoin without moving the price. I was making some assumptions, but as an example, if just 1/10 of the US population (approx 32 million) put $5000 of savings into buying bitcoin, that is pushing 160 billion dollars into the system. That alone (even ignoring all current bitcoin investors) would put a hard minimum value of $11,000 per BTC. But you can't ignore all the current bitcoin owners, and many won't just dump coins instantly at the market rate, when in reality there are probably millions of bitcoins that won't move at any price (satoshi's, and any intentionally destroyed BTC, for example) so that value could be astronomically higher. Plus, this is only looking at US population- for the above scenario to be true, it would take people all over the world investing in bitcoin. Being conservative here, I'd say the value would reach $20k per bitcoin at a minimum.\n\nAnyway, that pushes the value of a single bitcoin to values almost 100X current values. Mining companies work based on expected profit. If nothing else changes, mining suddenly becomes 100X more profitable. Well, something else would change, it's just human nature. Mining operations would increase their hardware budget by 100X, which pushes difficulty and cost of a 50% attack.\n\nAnd then there is the actual action of investing in mining hardware to perform the 50% attack- word would get around that all the ASIC companies are sold out and/or have huge orders in place for superevil government corp or lots of little fake companies or whatnot. This huge interesting in mining equipment out of nowhere could push things even further. Remember, to get a 50% control of the system requires investing in 100% of the current hardware available. Basically, the cost of buying enough mining hardware to attempt a 50% attack would be increasing simply because of the impact of attempting to make that purchase.

Makes sense from a certain architectural point of view, especially if you consider that current Bitcoin tech can\'t scale as-is to support even the world\'s coffee sales.\n\nBut another group believes that the original peer-to-peer vision of Bitcoin means that it is in fact that "one coffee transaction" - ie the peer-to-peer transfer of value - that is Bitcoin\'s mission.  Such a viewpoint immediately means that maximizing the throughput of the Bitcoin network, and keeping as much commerce as possible on the Bitcoin blockchain, is the goal.\n\nWhere I\'m going with this, is that I\'ve watched this debate unfolding, and I think you\'ve hit the nail on the head.

The idea behind the network is that a consensus on the valid chain will occur for economic reasons.\n\nThe longer it takes for users and node operators to decide which new protocol version will be the 'real' bitcoin the longer the system is effectively shut down.  While this scenario is temporarily a negative presumably the only reason the new branch got big enough to threaten to orphan those still using the old branch us because a large portion if the stakeholders believe the new feature is worth the pain.\n\nIf Bitcoin can't survive contentious forks, repeatedly, then it will have to be entirely centralized with a single official code development organization. This was fine and expected as it was being created but it's growing up now. Distributed development and resulting forks from one teams version to another should be expected.\n\nCan Bitcoin survive and thrive as a truly distributed system?  I hope so. I think it can and I hope it does, but really the worst case scenario (other than a sudden lack of trust and interest after a difficult fork) is for two separate forks to both continue as separate duplicated chains.

But I find it incredible neither side has presented even a rough simulation / demonstration for their case. It\'s all incredibly hand-wavy.\n\nThere isn\'t really a way to simulate economics like that without throwing a ton of assumption into it.\n\nWe can look into Metcalfe\'s law and see that the network effect is damaged by people using different Bitcoins.\n\nWe can look into fake confirmation attacks and see that one side of the fork will have incredible risk and understand that we should minimize the stake of the minority fork. In other words, a 99% / 1% fork is much much better than a 90% / 10% fork because it leaves 1% vs 10% of the network vulnerable to fake confirmation attacks and service interruptions.\n\nOne very important objection is the stupidity of the upgrade mechanism. 75% of mining power does not a fork make. We had 95% miner votes and that still wasn\'t sufficient. We had 6 fake confirmations ON ACCIDENT with 95%. We cannot risk 75%, 95% is still relatively unsafe in todays mining ecosystem. Also, 75% measures the MINERS, not the stake holders. It is very possible that, as it has been with almost every upgrade, 75% of miners upgrade before most full nodes and stake holders. What does this mean? A portion of the miners are mining fools gold not accepted by the merchants, they possibly move back mining with the 1MB rule, there is uncertainly, instability, confirmations are meaningless until this is sorted out, many are at risk of losing money.': 1, "> there may be some clever way to allow some sidechain equivalent that I don't know of\n\nYeah, I was going for that, although this is probably the worst place to brainstorm about it. :-)\n": 2, "1) This 75% is NOT stake holders, it is not nodes, it is miners. The stake holders or full nodes could still be 70% on the 1MB chain. This would lead to, more likely, miners downgrading and the 30% with the new rules having fake confs and being vulnerable to theft, or the 70% being vulnerable to fake confs. It all would depend on which changes first, the miners to 1MB-ruleset or the full nodes and stake holders to the >1MB-ruleset. This leaves us with instability and uncertainty during this time. This is the incredibly dangerous result of a contentious hard fork.\n\n2) Even if it was 75% of stake holders, that is very dangerous, 25% of full nodes or 25% of stake recognizing a different blockchain means 25% (or 75% depending who changes) is vulnerable to fake conf attacks. \n\nIn this scenario 100% of the merchants accept the 1MB rules while only 75% accept the >1MB rules. With the 0.7-0.8 fork we downgraded because it was the smart thing to do, I could see the same thing happening again.\n\n3) Miners don't have to follow their votes. As we saw with the most recent softfork, 95% wasn't even perfectly safe. We ended up with ~55% of the network actually accepting the rules they voted for, ~40% weren't using the rules they voted for. Large miners actually have an incentive to vote for the >1MB rules and switch back because it essentially creates a softfork back to 1MB-ruleset scenario where a large portion of the miners are mining invalid blocks and they profit from the lesser competition.": 4, 'Once the fork will happened (that is to say when one block bigger than 1mb will be publish) the most secure chain will be the one with the most hash rate,\n\n': 1, "> no official ruleset\n\nBut there is a de facto ruleset, and that's what I think OP is talking about.

There's some point where I can profit handsomely if I spend the $300K per-day to subsidize an incentive for miners to return to mining BTCs (bitcoin).   With a premium for mining BTCs, that's where the hashing capacity will go.  \n\nThere are other attacks and approaches that are profitable if the hard fork fails.  Heck, every custodial wallet (i.e., exchanges, e-wallets, online services holding customer balances, etc.) might have a short-term interest in seeing a hard fors result in two persistent chains.

A private key is just a number:\n\nhttp://bitzuma.com/posts/six-things-bitcoin-users-should-know-about-private-keys/\n\nLet's say you choose 5 as your private key. You can create a practically infinite set of key pairs with a simple rule:\n\n    new private key = 5 + offset\n\nwhere offset is a number such as 1,2,3, etc. when you need a new private key, you just add one to the last offset you used, and add the offset to 5. When you need a new public key, you generate it from the new private key. This is called *private derivation*.\n\nIn this case, your master private key would be the number 5.\n\nThis is not such a good system for a few reasons, but it illustrates the basic math.\n\nUnderstanding how a master public key works is a bit tricker. But the basic idea is that you can generate public keys from the master public key in much the same way as you generated private keys. Except you don't actually need private keys to do it. This is public derivation, and requires some understanding of how elliptic curve math works.\n\nThis might be helpful:\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=iB3HcPgm_FI\n": 9, 'Private keys are numbers and public keys are elliptic curve points. In this sense, master and child public keys are a *scalar product* of the private numbers with a *generator* point G (and this scalar product is defined such that it is a one-way calculation, i.e., you cannot derive the *private* scalar from the *public* resulting point).\n\nSo, following your example and keeping the simplification:\n\n    child_key = master_key + offset\n\nbecomes in terms of public keys:\n\n    child_key * G = master_key * G + offset * G\n\nwhich is the same as:\n\n    public_child_key = public_master_key + offset * G\n\nThis is how anyone can determine the whole public-key hierarchy without knowing the private keys.
