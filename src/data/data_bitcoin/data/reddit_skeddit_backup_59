Smart contracts do not have private keys, but since they are a fundamental part of a Ethereum-like cryptocurrency their logic is consensus-enforced.\n\nBitcoin-style smart contracts aren\'t pieces of code, they are cryptographic protocols which enforce certain properties. For example, "If Alice redeems coins she also has to share a secret which Bob can use to claim X". Or "Bob can claim funds after 3 days but he has to pay certain amount to Clair".\n\nMeta-coins like XCP can implement Ethereum-style contracts, but they can only affect assets which exist within the meta-coin, but not the host currency.\n\nNote that in both kinds mentioned above there are no private keys associated with smart contracts, and thus they cannot control multisig (or sign anything).\n\nFinally, there\'s a Codius-style smart contracts which actually have their own private keys. But they aren\'t decentralized, they need to be hosted by certain trusted parties. If a smart contract system relies on private keys it must rely on a limited number of trusted participants. (Otherwise private keys will be known to arbitrary participants who can be adversaries willing to violate contract rules and profit from it.)\n\nSo it seems like you\'re confusing Ethereum-style and Codius-style smart contracts.

Who decides what goes into that release?  Basically Maxwell and Back with moderate input from another half dozen people that mostly include their employees and friends.  The Core team is equivalent to having a ton of full nodes all hosted on one cloud service.\n\nI care far more about dev centralization than mining centralization.  Miners incentives are pretty closely aligned with the general bitcoin community\'s and we\'ve seen that in their actions.  Miners frequently act "altruistically" because the value of their hardware is dependent on the price of bitcoin, which depends on the health of the network.  In contrast, developers\' vision for bitcoin and specific incentives can be very much at odds with large swaths of the bitcoin community.  The blockstream team has received more than $40 million in venture capital funding, an amount that totally dwarfs their bitcoin holdings.  Their vision for bitcoin and their financial success are directly opposed to the current success of most bitcoin businesses; blockstream has very explicitly said that encouraging user adoption near-term is not a priority for them.  \n\nThe hope is that this is resolved with a longer term outlook - once LN or something like it is released, incentives will be better aligned.  My fear is that the gap between now and that release is "inventing" competitors.  We\'ve created major opportunities for competing FinTech to capture current and potential bitcoin users.\n\nThe simplest example for this are microtransactions.  Once considered one of bitcoin\'s potential primary use cases, the core dev team now views these as uninteresting and unfeasible for bitcoin (until LN is released.)  Open Bazaar may succeed or fail based on microtransactions and so we\'ve forced their team to consider implementing a crypto other than bitcoin, something that can support lower fees and faster confirmations.  If Open Bazaar becomes a successful platform for microtransactions and uses some other crypto, we will have pulled a "friendster" and created a big competitor.  While bitcoin certainly can\'t support microtransactions long-term without LN, the question is simply what to do in this interim period.  No one doubts that the bitcoin network can easily and safely support 2 MB blocks, the question is just how many full nodes would drop off and how important such a drop off is.  In my opinion, a decrease from 5000 to 4000 full nodes is far less of an existential risk to bitcoin than the alternative that we\'re currently doing - which is creating unnecessary and serious competitors. \n\n': 1, "They wouldn't have been part of the 75%+ miner consensus beforehand...\n\nThis is the whole point.

The\nfirst is to view the economics of the adoption and diffusion of the blockchain as powerful new\nICT technology. Such a technology-based approach is currently the default perspective in the\nfinance and banking sector, viewing blockchain as a new technology that will be adopted\ndifferentially by some banks, leading to a further round of technological competition in the\nbanking sector. The conclusion to this view is to expect the same market process as we have\nseen with other technologies: some banks will adapt and prosper, others will lag and collapse.\nTheir success will depend on their strategic choices and uses of this new technology to drive\nproductivity and competitive efficiency.\n\nBut there is also a second economic perspective, focusing not on technology, but on\ngovernance. This view based on economic reasoning, begins by asking what type of\ntechnology is blockchain. The answer to that question, we have argued in this chapter, is that\nblockchain is fundamentally a technology of decentralization and is therefore better\nunderstood as a new institutional technology for coordinating people\xe2\x80\x94i.e., for making\neconomic transactions\xe2\x80\x94which then competes with firms and markets. This path seeks to \nunderstand what economic transactions currently occurring in firms or markets will shift to\nblockchains.\n\nThe new institutional economics and public choice economics of blockchains emphasize\ndisintermediation and decentralization. In a world of blockchains the functions and operations\nof banking may not change, but the economic organization of banking may shift significantly.\nIn this view, it is banks that will experience fundamental shifts in their organizational\nboundaries, with many transactions currently governed through hierarchy, relational\ncontracting or market transactions shifting to the blockchain as an outworking of economic\nefficiency over transaction costs.\n\nBlockchain is a technology for internal exit from incumbent institutions. Simultaneously\nit is a technology for the creation of new institutions. The upshot of this is emergent\neconomies built on blockchains. This is a political-economic rupture and bifurcation in which\nan incumbent institutional order precipitates a constellaxy\xe2\x80\x94a constitutionally ordered\ncatallaxy. The relevance of the development of blockchains for banking is that it has shifted\nthe boundary between hierarchical banking organizations and non-territorial, spontaneously\nordered, self-organizing economies. This transition suggests the future of banking will be\nconducted in more evolvable and dynamically efficient institutions of governance.': 2}, ('The Bitcoin symbol was put into Unicode, when and how can I start using it instead of typing btc every time?', 71): {"All hail our new \xe2\x82\xbf overloards\n\nEDIT: Realised I might only be seeing an empty white box as I don't have the correct language pack or something?": 2, '[The planned date of publication for the core specification is August NN, 2016.](http://unicode.org/versions/Unicode9.0.0/) - so I suppose after that, anyone implementing a new unicode font will at least have to think about adding it.

Done." and listed it as being capable of processing enough to net you an amount of bitcoin that totals roughly $72 dollars per month.\n\nIt\'s not exactly major income, but at a $50 hit *once* to make what is essentially a free $72 a month, that seems like it\'s an absolutely incredible amount of profit.
