It\'s faster than my 802.11g router can spit out on a regular wifi and I had to upgrade to a faster 5GHz wifi just to be able to download at full speed.\n\nThe thing is here, there are quite a few internet provider companies competing with each other.  You have local "de cartier" (of the neighborhood) providers that offer really fast service that\'s wired via RJ-45 (!!), plus the cable companies, of which there are 3, plus other companies providing service.  They are all competing with each other.  This brings price down.  Compare that to American cities where by and large nowadays you have 1 huge cable company for the whole city and its interest is in providing the least amount of service possible for the highest price, since it is basically a monopoly.\n\nWherever you go in Romania, there\'s free wifi.  I was at a hair salon for LITTLE KIDS (the kind with toys and fancy chairs to keep kids happy as they get their hair cut), and the free wifi there was blazing fast.  I\'m talking downloading a 1GB file in a 2-3 mins kind of fast.  And that was a hair salon!  Not even a cafe!\n\nEvery crappy cafe or even corner store has a wifi.  There are no nazi laws here making the business owner liable for anything illegal done on the wifi (or if there are, they aren\'t enforced).  So that, and combined with the cheap internet means every business also ends up installing a wifi router when it opens up.  Often they package the whole deal along with a landline for the business owner, thus encouraging the ubiquity.  A store owner almost doesn\'t respect himself if he doesn\'t offer free wifi and is afraid he\'ll lose customers.  And seriously, the free wifi is really fast here.  \n\nI went to Paris and noticed the wifi there sucks.  Most European cities have incredibly shitty wifi everywhere, and most people don\'t even expect to get free wifi at their cafes anymore. Partly this is because in Western Europe the nazi laws in place make the businesses fearful of repricussions if their wifi is used to download child porn, and also partly because the internet in general sucks balls and is expensive in countries like France as compared to Romania.\n\nSo yeah, the internet here is really really incredibly good and cheap.': 9, "Isn't there already like 23 different Bitcoin capitals in the world?\n\nAdd Romania to the list.": 1, "Sweet!

These acts were aimed at a new invention that was beginning to disrupt the rail car and horse and buggy industry. This invention was called the automobile and its purpose was to leverage technology to be more efficient. Unfortunately, due to the Red Flag Acts laws, it had the opposite effect.\n> \n> The Acts included corrosive regulations, like requiring a man to walk in front of the automobile as it entered town waving a red flag to notify the citizens of the pending \xe2\x80\x9cdanger on wheels\xe2\x80\x9d headed their way. They also severely limited the speed these automobiles could travel, which was one of the primary benefits that they offered. But what they really limited was one thing: innovation.\n> \n> The acts stifled innovation and made it difficult for this disruptive idea to grow as quickly as it did in other countries, and in the end, the United Kingdom was left behind in the race to develop the automobile.\n> \n> You might not be shocked to hear that it later turned out it was lobbyists for the rail car and horse and buggy companies pushing for these stifling laws. These companies were able to squeeze out profits for a few more years but they did so at the cost of their country. Their singular focus on the profitability of their own industry, and their powerful grip on politicians who made the laws, allowed them to stifle innovation, which ultimately damaged the United Kingdom. Britain lost its standing in the multi-billion dollar auto industry to Germany, Italy, the U.S., and others.\n> \n> We are in the midst of another revolution now and it embarrasses me to say that the United States is following the path the United Kingdom followed with the Red Flag Acts of over 200 years ago. We are stifling the innovation of what people refer to as one of the most important technological developments since the internet. I am talking about the technology called Bitcoin.\n> \n> You\xe2\x80\x99ve probably heard of it in the news. The mastermind of an online drug empire going to jail, the collapse of MtGox, and the laundering of money through this invisible currency. While these juicy headlines spread like wildfire there is much more going on that does not. Did you know the NYSE is building a platform for trading stocks via Bitcoin technology? What about the fact that nearly $1 billion has been invested into Bitcoin-related startups in the past 2 years? Have you heard of the dozens of Visa executives leaving their jobs to join Bitcoin companies?\n> \n> Bitcoin is surrounded by misconceptions. Despite what many think, Bitcoin is not just a currency. Bitcoin is a technology. It is a platform and it is capable of doing what no other technology has ever done in the past. Imagine escrow without escrow agents, or a real estate title system that didn\xe2\x80\x99t require a $15B industry just because it can\xe2\x80\x99t maintain proper databases. Imagine being able to send a penny to someone in the most remote jungle of China, and then them being able to send it right back to you. All for free and all done instantly.\n> \n> While I could go on and on with examples for you, the truth is, no one really knows what Bitcoin will do in the future. This is the case with every new technology. Imagine back when you first heard about the internet, did you ever imagine what it would be capable of today? What about the cell phone 20 years ago? If someone had told you that you could run your entire life from your pocket, you would have thought they were crazy.\n> \n> My point is this: no one can predict what a technology is capable of because that\xe2\x80\x99s what technologies do, they evolve and expand, and the good ones disrupt inefficient systems.\n> \n> While this seems logical to most, this logic doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be understood in the offices of our state and federal regulators. Several states (recently including New York) are passing aggressive laws that they say are aimed at safely regulating Bitcoin companies. But the laws they are passing are not constructive regulations\xe2\x80\x93they are designed to stymie innovation.\n> \n> Bitcoin will continue to grow, because there is no real way to stop an innovation that people demand and see value in. Innovation is like a stream of water. You can block it, but it will always grow in size and eventually forge new rivers around the dam. That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what we are seeing happen now: jobs, technology, and entrepreneurs are flowing right out of this country.\n> \n> Earlier this month, the BitLicense passed in New York. Twelve leading Bitcoin companies announced they would leave New York that day. Bitcoin sites offer notices on the homepage that they don\xe2\x80\x99t serve Russia, North Korea or New York. Does that not alarm anyone? The financial capitol of the United States, indeed of the world, is being left behind.\n> \n> Do you not find it concerning that a state in the United States of America is appearing alongside countries that are known for abusing their citizens\xe2\x80\x99 rights? What kind of message does this send?\n> \n> The BitLicense of New York passed and other states will likely continue to pass similar laws. These laws will slow down Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s growth here in America, but Bitcoin will continue to shape global financial markets and change the way business is done all over the world. The question is whether America will be there for it, or find itself playing catch up and working at a disadvantage to other countries who were more receptive to innovative technology from the start.\n> \n> It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how much money lobbyists give, the laws that corrupt politicians pass, or how many big companies work to eliminate Bitcoin. It\xe2\x80\x99s not going anywhere and there is nothing anyone can do about that. Bitcoin connects the world financially just like the internet did.\n> \n> The internet brought people online and Bitcoin is bringing money online.\n> \n> I ask you to do your research, call upon experts, and spend time reading about the\xc2\xa0opportunities\xc2\xa0a technology like Bitcoin can bring to our world. Read it with an open mind; pretend you are just reading about the internet for the first time 20 years ago. Would you be skeptical? Of course. Would there be concerns about regulation? Absolutely.\n> \n> Passing regulations on Bitcoin now is a foolish and irresponsible decision. To do so is to assume that one understands how the technology will develop, how it will be applied, and how many applications it might have. These are the very early days of a very powerful technology, and it is too soon to try to draw it into a regulatory box.\n> \n> The United Kingdom missed an enormous opportunity with the automobile, but they learned an important lesson. In fact, today the UK is leading the world in its support for Bitcoin technology by passing laws that make it a favorable destination for companies all over the world. They understand, as we should, that to compete in the global economy demands early adoption of new technologies, not skepticism and heavy handed regulation.\n> \n> You don\xe2\x80\x99t stay on top by stifling innovation; you stay on top by innovating. It\xe2\x80\x99s a truly scary path we are headed down and you have the power to stop it. Will you?\n> \n> We have always been a nation of pioneers, let us continue writing history with our inventions.\n> \n> Sincerely,\xc2\xa0\nPaul Puey\nCo-founder & CEO of Airbitz': 36, 'The pro-"regulation" guy?

(A harm which is only weakly mitigated by cryptographic unlinkability since the _user_ can be coerced to disclose linkages at any time by the mint refusing further transactions.)\n\n[As an aside, in their current codebase I don\'t actually see any implementation of blind signing, just boring x509 stuff-- but the capabilities discussed in their marketing stuff certainly makes it sound like its intended to become an actual ecash system]\n\nThe claims about being able to be taxed seem likely spurious as well, at least in the strong sense.  In that one could use multiparty computation to move funds entirely via the remininting operations in spite of the linked key requirement. Even ignoring MPC, closing off side-channel ways of transferring funds directly will likely require substantially limiting the system\'s capabilities (e.g. no smart contracts, probably no multisignature) if its even possible at all; and this on top of a costly-to-operate "identity" framework (which itself, is also not terribly compatible with human rights-- in our world where the ability to speak and act anonymously is often essential to having meaningful freedoms). To prevent technological bypasses the obvious logical step is to try to use technical measures like remote attest to prevent users from modifying the operation of their wallets.\n\nThe whole notion of integrated tracking for tax collection as a value add is at odds with how tax collection and enforcement actually works in practice: Tax collection is generally accomplished through self-reporting, auditing, and stiff penalties for cheating and not by baking Orwellian surveillance into our money itself.  While it\'s true that people do at times successfully cheat tax collection, using technological measures to attempt to enforce the rules will not change that fact, only change the specific mechanisms which people use to cheat. Additionally, real tax systems also involve complex rules which shouldn\'t be implemented in a low level transfer system and if they are implemented result in trivial bypasses (consider the tax implications for gifts and personal loans in the US system as an example).\n\nI\'m somewhat surprised to see this listed as a GNU project, especially with this particular sales pitch for its virtues. The system\'s design requires all users perform their activities via a central server whose operation they cannot control.

Nowadays, there are some anonymization methods to combat ATC but there has been little research into ways to counter ABPN.\n\n> This paper proposes a new anonymization technology called Transaction Remote Release (TRR). Inspired by The Onion Router (TOR), TRR is able to render several typical attacking methods of ABPN ineffective.\n\n> Furthermore, the performance of encryption and decryption of TRR is good, and the growth rate of the cipher is very limited.
