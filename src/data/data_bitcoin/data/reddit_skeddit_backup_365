And anyone can check their address online, or probably an app will just scan a QR code on the note and tell you the balance so you can be sure it is backed. Since anyone could try to redeem any note at any time, even a tiny bit of fractional reserve cheating would be statistically quite dangerous.\n\nFor bank accounts, they could be required tell you the specific set of serial numbers (BTC addresses) your account balance is backed by.\n\n*Address re-use would make this easiest, though I suspect some will say that is a bad thing.": 1, 'There is an article in 2012 about Greece http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-18279522\n\nOne major difference is that Bitcoin cannot be printed, or produce out of thin air.

That is, they have enough assets or clout that they can sell a promise to pay later, without involving any other party.\n\nThis type of entity is not served by Bitcoin at all.\n\nTo utilize Bitcoin at all it would issue promises to pay in Bitcoin and it could issue as many of these as its assets and credit worthiness allows. These promises could be tokens on a side or alt-chain or plain old fashioned paper money. This would be the Bitcoin Standard way of accomplishing this.\n\nThe benefit would be in gaining access to cryptocurrency developments in smart contracts and prediction markets, etc. (should they use a side or alt-chain) but they would never give up their power over monetary or fiscal policy except in some apocalyptic scenario. Actually, they could and will likely get all of this without Bitcoin but the network will be closed to banks and regulated parties, etc. since they can't incentivize security while keeping these monetary policy powers all to themselves. \n\nThey could incentivize security in their separate network by delegating monetary policy to this network in order to achieve a traditional central banking situation (power to inflate/deflate when necessary) but they would be trusting a network of machines to determine when its necessary. Again, I don't see them choosing this until far after the singularity has made the benefits undeniable. \n\nThe only way to use Bitcoin directly would be to completely dissolve the government authority over money and units. The government would be a node on the network like anyone else. No government would choose this as being sovereign means authority over money. The English even refer to gold coins as sovereigns, rightly so. \n\nThis kind of transition to Bitcoin would go down very much like how Zimbabwe is transitioning from their local currency to the US dollar.

One of the main selling points to vendors was the whole 'no chargebacks' thing. Which is true of course with the standard disclaimer about confirmations and such, but I'm not so sure many merchants are aware of the difference. The issue that I'm afraid of is not that they'll lose a lot of money from Bitcoin fraud, that's pretty unlikely as they should become aware of it quickly if it happens, but that they'll feel like they were lied to about Bitcoin.

Of course, once one little guy is doing it (and profiting from it), then the others slightly bigger might do it as well to compete, and then you quickly end up in a situation where either everyone is doing it or the rules have to be re-worked to disincentivize that behavior.\n\nIdeally you would have short term, individual incentives aligned with long term collective incentives.  The current first seen policy presents some misalignments on that front.  Whether or not it ultimately becomes a significant problem will depend on the subtleties of the situation, and ones that imo are difficult to impossible to model and predict with any confidence.  If you want to play it safe, focusing on aligning incentives is the way to go.\n\nYour argument that miners are incentivized to protect the health and the value of the network is a good one in regards to things like a 51% attack, since the attacker(s) in that case also represent a majority stakeholder in a big part of the network infrastructure, and their actions would have significant consequences to the network.  It\'s a significantly weaker argument when the "offending" miner can be arbitrarily small, as in the case of RBF.

However gold has had its fraud scandals too, with gold-plated bars covering cadmium and tungsten. Also it's difficult to train a merchant to take gold, several tests must be run to be sure the mass, volume, and weight correlate to 100% gold. Here's a great example of using a [gold-coin gage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iklaFDWLR5s) to prove gold is good. Imagine trying to train someone to do that, with a thousand dollars on the line if they're wrong, and they're working for minimum wage.\n\nBitcoin's cryptographic verification is 100%, it either works or doesn't, and cannot be faked.\n\n- **Fungible:** each piece of gold is identical to the others, and equal in worth.\n\nEach bitcoin is certainly fungible as well\n\n- **Incorruptible**: it should be able to store for a long time in any conditions without rusting, breaking down, etc. Gold, which won't oxidize, is beautiful for this. Bitcoin is better for several reasons. \n\n- **Rare:** Here gold begins to break down. Gold is rare only on earth; there are multiples of what we have no on other planets and especially in the asteroids that we will begin mining this century. A single metals-rich asteroid has more gold on it than has been mined in all of human history, and there are thousands and thousands of these out there waiting. Gold's rarity is an illusion.\n\nBitcoin's rarity, however, is a guarantee. Not another bitcoin will be found in the entire universe outside earth.\n\n--- \n\nWhere gold still beats bitcoin is in its long history which makes it really well known, and the large number of people that would be willing to accept a gold payment if push came to shove, and the analog nature of gold.": 10, 'Who audits the auditors?': 6, 'Anonymous solutions have already been created.

It uses container objects, rather than being littered with new and delete,  it doesn\'t create its own string implementation, which virtually every 90\'s C++ project does.  You keep saying "Windows only" and yet it doesn\'t use the windows APIs-- not at all, the software was portable, using wx from the first release.   "No API" for a GUI application? Sure _some_ do that but it\'s not that common.   \n\nIt\'s easy to point out similar vintage applications that have no unit tests, e.g. [fldigi](http://www.w1hkj.com/download.html) -- and it\'s also full of raw pointers and other non-modernisms which Bitcoin\'s initial release lacked (though it\'s currently 10x larger than Bitcoin\'s original release).  So I think I am outright disagreeing with the specific points you\'re making here.   As I mentioned, there were tests that weren\'t distributed with the software; but it\'s absolutely not the case the C/C++ applications today universally come with tests (though its certainly more common).\n\nAs far as "everything in main.cpp".  In the initial release main.cpp is 12% of the lines of code, which is "heavy" but I pointed out: The whole codebase was ~14kloc! a very small program, and 12% is  just 1875 lines. In absolute terms, main.cpp in Bitcoin Core is twice that size now (though a much much smaller percentage). If you are not using some comprehensive IDE having things split up too much is a major burden, prior to LTO there can also be major performance hits for C++ applications in having more separate compilation units. If you disagree I can go cite examples, but it feels like a waste of time. \n\n> Google C++ code base is unusually good. \n\nThe Google C++ code base follows a very opinionated style guide (with, as I understand it, mechanical enforcement) which contains some elements that some people strongly disagree with.

It didn't have extensive modularity-- indeed-- but it shouldn't have: It was 14,615 lines of code (9500 lines without the separate UI parts) and clearly written by ~a single person.  Extensive modularity would have increased the size and complexity without increasing the functionality, at the expense of the defect rate.   Things were not randomly splattered around-- there was a [main.cpp](https://github.com/trottier/original-bitcoin/blob/master/src/main.cpp) which contained most things, and a few separate other files that contained other logical units.  I found it to be highly readable and was able to get a clear understanding of the functionality with basically a weekend read-through.\n\nData structures were largely defined along with the code that used them-- which is good for reading to understand, though less ideal fore reading to reimplement; similar to the use of templatized seralizers (which were also responsble for a lot of bug avoidance).\n\nThe functions and variable names are all clear and descriptive, the code is commented usefully (though not in the kind of epic explanatory way someone might go for). It was largely free of redundant or superfluous code. In all these respects the software would fair very well in a comparison with most commercial proprietary packages I've had the displeasure of working on; and not too poorly against many Open Source projects (especially ones with small development teams).\n\nAnd the defect rate is particularly notable; at inception the software was unusually free of defect. Unlike many other initial Bitcoin packages which in their first releases were full of crashes and deadlocks Bitcoin was nearly free of them. Most of the serious bugs fixed subsequently were added by other people.\n\nThough the software did not ship with tests, it's clear that extensive testing was done-- and there were additional testing harnesses not published with the software (some were shared privately with others), I can only assume for privacy reasons.\n\nWhile the initial version was shipped as windows only, the software was easily portable-- rather than using MS specific functionality, it used cross-platform tools.  It utilized a relatively modern C++ style, largely eschewing manual memory management for container objects (for example), a decision which probably contributed to the low defect rate.\n\nThis isn't to say that it got everything right; it surely didn't-- but much of the weirdness and problems came from external code, not code written here.

Heard about it again in 2013 and kicked myself for not buying some. \n\nStarted making good money for the first time in my life this year and decided to buy some as an investment back in january when the price was around $220. Having that skin in the game really helped educate me on BTC, Blockchain etc... \n\nI became obsessed and devoured everything i could read. Digital gold by Nathaniel Popper was a favorite of mine. \n\nAt first i diversified, I'm a decent investor and i saw the need to buy crypto's as a space. So i bought BTC, XRP and DOGE. About 80% BTC 20% for the other two. After reading more about the ALT's and the lack of a network effect, 51% attacks etc... i consolidated it all back to BTC. \n\nAfter going through the rabbit hole the last few months i've become as hardcore on Bitcoin as anyone from the beginning. It has changed my worldview, Turned me into a raving lunatic at parties and become over 50% of my total investment portfolio. \n\nIm a stark raving lunatic like the rest of you now, and i went from full on skeptic to believing we can change the world in about 6 months.

I wish I hadn't doubted myself so much or I could have bought in a bit cheaper! I was going back in forth in my head for the last month or so about what I should do and finally bit the bullet before the rally we had earlier this week.\n\nI'm in this for the long haul though, I cashed out a portion of a RRSP to purcahse coins. That's how much I believe in bitcoin and how little I believe in the current system.\nI'm one of those people who believes we're in for another 2008-esque market correction and I just didn't feel comfortable having all of my money in the market.\n\nI'll probably try promoting it more once I get my hot wallet all set up and I can actually demonstrate how it works. I'm still a little disappointed in how few options there are to spend, but I know that will come naturally with more adoption.": 11, 'The Bitcoin tip for 1000 satoshi has been collected by *bitcoinchamp*.\n\n\n--\n\n[^^what ^^is ^^ChangeTip?](https://www.reddit.com/r/changetip/wiki/tipping-on-reddit)': 1, 'I started studying it back in Nov \'13 at the peak. Luckily I sat on the sidelines long enough to watch the MTGOX collapse. That gave me enough time to study the underpinnings and read a LOT about it. I was actually reading alt.cypherpunks back in the early 90s but had gone corporate soon after and got out of that life. When I learned that all of this came from that community, I was blown away seeing these abstract concepts had come to life. I\'ve been a technologist for a very long time and an old cipher geek so this stuff came to me very quickly. I have a deep appreciation for how Satoshi solved a wide variety of very real problems and still enjoy reading Nick Szabo\'s library. So much great stuff in there.\n\nSeparately, having worked low level jobs in finance, I knew that there was no such thing as free money, and that there were going to be tax implications for how Bitcoin is being used. Sure enough, I watched the Senate hearings, the NYDFS panel and read the FinCEN notices and IRS guidance and I knew this is simply not just cash that can gain or lose value while it sits in your pocket. Once the dust settled and I developed a strategy for when to buy, how much to buy, what I would actually do with it and how to meet recordkeeping requirements, I finally bought for the first time in January of this year. I keep each purchase in a separate HD wallet so that I know exactly how much I paid for each tranche and I tag each transaction with how much it was worth when I spent or sold it. I only spend if I\'m making less than 50c in capital gains on the transaction. Spending at close to the purchase price is always preferred,  but I\'ve had to spend some that was way down from purchase.\n\nI think some people tend to lose sight of how much you\'re spending to convert your cash into BTC and sometimes back again when making a purchase. I\'m still below $1,000 at LibertyX so I\'m still paying Bitstamp +0%. I once bought via Google Wallet just to try it out with this seller and paid 15%. Ouch.\n\nWhat gets me is the fold app. Do people realize that in the US you\'re supposed to keep track of the exchange rate and date of purchase and the exchange rate and date of sale of all your BTC so that you can calculate how much value your BTC gained or lost while you held it? If all my purchases were in the form of 99c or less worth of BTC every time I swiped my card, I would be in an accounting nightmare. Capturing the exchange rate and purchase date for each transaction isn\'t even the hard or annoying part. Say I go to buy something worth $500 off Craigslist and pay in BTC. At tax time, I need to sit down with every single fold transaction (all less than a dollar, right?) and figure out which 600 or so BTC purchases contributed to the $500 payment I just made. For each and every one, I need to figure out how much each BTC purchase went up or down in value while I held it. Then, after canceling out the gains with losses in the table, I need to look for those that went up more than 50c while I held them and I need to write another check for 42% of the total gained. Holy crap, what a nightmare. And forget about the price fluctuations! Sure, its dollar cost averaging but I may be averaging purchase prices between $200 and $300! That $500 purchase may have actually cost me $575 during a long, slow decline. If I must pay that much for something in BTC, I will go to a LibertyX to buy it and spend it in the same day and get it all in one big tranche at one price. I\'m convinced everyone just ignores that and treats it like cash.\n\nI could never use fold unless they made accounting a dream. /u/trasla is adding an Export to CSV to Mycelium at my request specifically to address this. Whenever I buy, I create a new HD wallet in Mycelium, tag it with the current date + 1 year and the exchange rate. I walk into a LibertyX, plunk down $50 cash and get a receipt. I go into the "Receive" view for the new HD wallet and copy the Bitcoin address to the clipboard. I go to the browser, bring up LibertyX, click Redeem a PIN, enter the PIN code on the receipt and paste in my Bitcoin address. I switch back to Mycelium, see that the transfer for the full $50 has started and go about my day. I do NOT blend BTC purchases from different dates and exchange rates in the same HD wallet. If I do, that blows up my system.\n\nWhen I go to spend, I look for a wallet that has enough balance to cover the intended purchase and was bought at or slightly above the current exchange rate. By spending at or below the purchase price, I avoid spending "free money". That\'s what gets you into trouble if you\'re not careful. /u/bitcointaxes has been an awesome resource in here for a long time.\n\nOTOH I don\'t get to spend all that often. Usually just the monthly drawing in /r/millionairemakers. I use it more as a showcase for some of the capabilities of crypto vs hoping to win a few thousand dollars. For each drawing, I grab a legacy address at bitaddress and import it into Mycelium. Then I move $1 (that is safe to spend!) into it and cryptographically sign a text message using the corresponding private key. I then post that text message with the signing data around it as my entry in the contest. Doing it that way guarantees that anyone can verify that the address has $1 in it before the drawing is held and that the redditor who claims to be me inside and outside the signed content also has the private key to that address. The IRS will accept one average price to use on a given day. So if I ever win and donations start arriving on the legacy address, I will have to create a new HD wallet for each day and transfer the winnings that arrived that day into the appropriate wallet. Same for ChangeTip donations. I always watch winners\' crypto wallets to see if they ever add their ChangeTip winnings or move their overall winnings to another wallet for safekeeping and management. The 5th and 6th have done it and the 7th is trying to keep up, sweeping new donations every so often. The 4th one has never moved their winnings and probably still has no idea that they have over $3,000 still sitting in their wallet.\n\nSorry for the book. tl;dr I\'m an old geek who grew up in the community where Bitcoin was born; I watched for over a year before making my first purchase this year and I can prove I break even or lose a little money every time I use BTC. I have loved the crypto technology behind it for over 20 years and I look forward to the day when I can step off an airplane in any country and buy a cup of coffee with BTC. Maybe even a house.': 13, "i've been keeping up with bitcoin since around/before the silkroad.  i have an account on localbitcoins for over two years.  \n\nmy money was stuck in shitty stocks and i was waiting for them to go back in the green.  \n\na few weeks ago i finally pulled out all my shit from stocks and bought in at around 245.  \n\nit's fun.  been on btcjam and bitlendingclub as an investor.  was really tempted to buy stuff off agora, but i'm moving to seattle anyways.  \n\nTO THE FUCKING MOON, DAMN IT.": 3, 'Thanks': 2, 'Got my friend to buy at 275 cad like a month ago after talking about bitcoin for 2 years.

The above are all external to the blockchain.': 1, '> Modern economics is obsessed with modelling. An overwhelming majority of academic papers on the subject work like so: they take data, and use data to construct formal mathematical models of economic processes. Models mostly describe a situation, and describe how that situation would be changed by a given set of events; a very simple example is that as the supply of a good diminishes, its price will increase. Another is that deficit spending increases the national income. A mathematical model is a predictive tool created to demonstrate the outcome of events in a massively simplified alternate universe.\n\n> As someone who rather enjoys voyages of the imagination, the use of mathematical models in economics is intriguing. The pretension that through using formal mathematical techniques and process  we can not only accurately understand, but accurately predict the result of changes in the economy is highly seductive. After all,we can accurately predict the future, right?\n\n> Wrong. The wonderful and terrible and confounding thing about our world is that it is a deeply unpredictable place, at least in the economic sphere where each number (for instance \xe2\x80\x9caggregate demand\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9caggregate supply\xe2\x80\x9d) in an equation may loosely refer to millions of huge, complex and dynamic events. When you\xe2\x80\x99re using huge simplifications to describe reality, those simplifications may miss the important details, and your projections may go askew.\n\n> Not all modelling is equal. Newton\xe2\x80\x99s model of gravitation (since superseded by Einstein\xe2\x80\x99s relativity) makes relatively accurate predictions about how gravitation works, and what would happen to an object dropped 500 metres above the Earth. NASA used Newton\xe2\x80\x99s equations to fly to the Moon. Of course, even in physics there are occasionally divergences and oddities (which is why there are quite often unrepeatable or anomalous experimental results, for instance the recent experiment that seemed to show neutrinos travelling faster than the speed of light). So economics \xe2\x80\x94 with its fixation on creating models of situations, and using these models to attempt to predict the future, mimics physics, chemistry and biology, where data is collected, and used to produce theories of physical processes which allow a modestly accurate representation of the future.\n\n> The key qualitative difference, though, is that mathematical economic theories don\xe2\x80\x99t accurately predict the future. Ben Bernanke \xe2\x80\x94 the chairman of the Federal Reserve, and one of the most-cited academic economists in the world told the world that subprime housing was contained. That is the economic equivalent of Stephen Hawking telling the world that a meteorite is going to miss the Earth, when it is really going to hit. Physicists can very accurately model the trajectories of rocks in space. But economists cannot accurately model the trajectories of prices, employment and interest rates down on the rocky ground.\n\n> The thing that I believe modern economists are most useful for is pointing out the glaring flaws in everyone else\xe2\x80\x99s theories. Steve Keen has made a public name for himself by publishing a book entitled Debunking Economics, in which he explains the glaring and various flaws in modern economic modelling (DSGE, New Classical, etc).\n\n> Economics is a complex and multi-faceted subjects. Economists must be in some measure, philosophers, historians, linguists, mathematicians, statisticians, political scientists, sociologists and psychologists, and many other things. The trouble is that at some stage in the last century the multi-faceted multi-dimensional economics (like that of Xenophon) was hijacked by mathematicians who tried to turn this huge and delicate subject into an equation. Yet economics \xe2\x80\x94 and economic decisions, from the macro to the micro level \xe2\x80\x94 is a human subject. It is subtle and psychological and sporadic. A human subject requires human language, human emotion, human intuition.\n\n> The grand theoretical-mathematical approach to economics is fundamentally flawed. Trying to smudge the human reality of economics and politics into cold mathematical shackles is degenerative.\n\n> So what to do if you want to understand the economy?\n\n> Follow the data, consider the history (similarities and differences between the past and the present) and explain your conclusions simply, as you would to a child. Consider philosophical definitions: what is money? What is demand? What is supply? What is value? How does demand affect supply? What are the global patterns of trade? Why have they emerged this way and not an alternative way? Consider possibilities. Admit the limitations of your knowledge and explore the boundaries. Stop forcing the construction of absolutes, grand frameworks, grand theories. No theory will ever be robust to everything nature will throw at it, but simple microeconomic heuristics (opportunity cost, cost-benefit analysis) combined with data-focussed historical analysis may be more robust than cold, dead mathematics.\n\n> As Heraclitus noted: No man ever steps in the same river twice\n\n> No two situations are identical. And in this universe even tiny differences can have huge effects on the outcome of a situation. This is the butterfly effect, a term coined by Edward Lorenz, and derived from the theoretical example of a hurricane\xe2\x80\x99s formation being contingent on whether or not a distant butterfly had flapped its wings several weeks before.\n\n> The pseudo-scientific school of mathematical economics hungers and craves for a perfect world, where each river is the same, where there is no butterfly effect, where human preferences are expressed in equation form, where there is no subtlety or ambiguity or uncertainty.\n\n> It is a dreamworld constructed by and for people with Asperger\xe2\x80\x99s Syndrome.\n\nhttp://azizonomics.com/2012/05/02/the-pseudoscience-of-economics/': 8, "I don't remember how/why I tagged him in my Tweet.

German law, for example, requires that in order to be VAT exempt, both currencies must be national currencies. Other countries have different and often more relaxed requirements.\n- Kokott concluded that because the exchange of national currency into a non-national currency (for a fee) is not sufficiently different from the exchange of national currency into another national currency (for a fee), it is also a financial service and the service provider fee is VAT exempt. Also, she thinks that the purpose of this particular VAT exemption is to help make international payments smooth. Kokott also said with respect to the arguments of German representatives (that Bitcoin is volatile and risky), that this is irrelevant, that this is an issue of financial market regulation and not VAT.\n- Bitcoin itself is not a claim on something (as would a demand deposit be), so the exemptions in this area do not apply if you trade bitcoins (the wording seems to imply that the exemption may apply if you were trading claims on bitcoins)\n\nThis was not a ruling, rather it was a "final opinion" and a recommendation for the court decision.
