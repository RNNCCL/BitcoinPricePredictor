You again can do that on multiple devices, but it is likely easier to do in one place, i.e. a server.\n\nWhat is a server?  Well, it wouldn't have to be a rack based system, but in the case of Factom it likely will be, as it is processing quite a bit of data.  But if your application has little demand, I'd guess you could run it on any system you are willing to keep up.": 1, 'TLDR Factom scales the block chain to be used as a storage of hashes which lets you audit systems and prove storage.\n\nAnyone who is storing data that you need to trust can use this to make their data irreversible and trustable.': 6, "Can't I hash a ton of documents, and then hash that collection of hashes?

Place your order.\n\nNow the only part that will suck for you is you'll have to wait for the ACH to clear to get your BTC out of coinbase(but your price is locked in) until you can verify your account.\nOnce you verify your account they'll let you have the coins instantly before the ACH clears. To verify you need to link a credit card, have purchased $100 in Bitcoin, wait 30 days from your first purchase, and answer a few questions. \n\nThere is also circle and trucoin, but they all pretty much operate the same way. Right now this is the easiest way to get BTC at a market price in the USA.

Right now there is only 5 billion or so dollars worth of bitcoin, so when somebody wants to buy or sell 100k or so, often there isn't a party willing to sell/buy that much all at once, so the price can go up and down quickly.   Once there are a ton more people using it, there will always be a lot of people looking to buy and sell, so it won't jump nearly as fast..  \n\n": 2, 'Thanks I will!

As it is completely open source, people are able to copy the bitcoin code to make altcoins such as dogecoin and litecoin. These are just clones with slightly different features such as improved anonymity or different mining reward systems. Because they are copies and because of the way most cryptocurrencies function, they are generally less secure systems and have far more volatile prices which exposes them to attacks and manipulation that are impossible with the amount of mining power and transaction volume Bitcoin has these days.\n\nAltcoins are pretty much experiments to see how certain concepts would work, and if a coin has a useful feature that Bitcoin could benefit from, it will probably be added in eventually.\n\n> I see where you\'re coming from but what would you say satisfies "stability". Zimbabwe dollars  are currency in my eyes but not stable, right?\n\nI don\'t think there is a specific point where a currency becomes stable, it is really your own perspective based off currencies you deal with.\n\nMost larger western currencies are highly stable as governments are able to control production as they see fit.
