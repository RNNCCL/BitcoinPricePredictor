In some ways, IPFS is similar to the World Wide Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high-throughput, content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG. IPFS combines a distributed hash table, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.[3]\n\nThe filesystem can be accessed in a variety of ways, including via FUSE and over HTTP. A local file can be added to the IPFS filesystem, making it available to the world. Files are identified by their hashes, so it's caching-friendly. They are distributed using a BitTorrent-based protocol. Other users viewing the content aid in serving the content to others on the network. IPFS has a name service called IPNS, a global namespace based on PKI, serves to build trust chains, is compatible with other NSes and can map DNS, .onion, .bit, etc. to IPNS.[4]\n": 1, 'IPFS is a really interesting protocol.

This would allow them to sell a sealed unit with a loaded balance as "cash" and then sweep it later. Would this be difficult? Does the device have a persistent memory so that it can warn users  if the seal is removed and then somehow replaced?\n\n* Someone manufacturing a look-alike device with a compromised RNG. \n\nI\'m only guessing all this from the FAQ.

The full-push single-funded channel establishment is superb for how it just drops into the existing Bitcoin payment flow while also giving the both the recipient and the sender (if they overfund or rebalance) a new useful connection to the Lightning Network.\n\nThe probabilistic micropayments are probably the neatest solution possible to the probabilistic payments problem.  All the previous solutions I\'ve heard vaguely outlined involved using regular transactions with some sort of fraud bond or multisig thing, but channels already have that  baked in, so adding probabilistic micropayments there with just a hashing opcode and `OP_SIZE` is really clever and adds no overhead.\n\nBut perhaps what I like best about probabilistic micropayments in a Lightning channel is that they never need to be about more than a single satoshi since the channel itself operates well at satoshi-resolution, so (as long as the Bitcoin price is below say $1 million USD per coin) you\'re only looking at probabilities over a penny or less.\n\nIf we were to do probabilistic payments using regular Bitcoin transactions, they\'d likely have to be some reasonably high multiple of the minimum relay fee to be reasonable, and I don\'t think most people are good at reasoning over probabilities involving money (e.g., if Alice makes a "$1" probabilistic payment at 100-to-1 odds, she\'s probably not going to feel any pain for the 99% of payments that keep her balance at the same place, but she will feel a sharp and sudden loss on the 1% of payments that reduce her balance by $100; but if all she loses is a penny or less, she probably won\'t feel any sense of loss at all.)': 6}, ('Healthcare Industry Will Face Even More Bitcoin Ransomware Threats', 0): {'How can the healthcare industry step up their cyber security in the next few years?': 1}, ('A closer look at gaming companies accepting Bitcoin payment', 0): {"Seems interesting! :) For anyone else interested to try them out here's the link https://xsolla.com\n\nEdit: [Xsolla doesn't accept Bitcoin anymore](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/425490/xsolla_doesnt_accept_bitcoin_anymore/)": 2, '/u/xsollasupport, bit_moon wants to send you a tip for 10 bits.

Interactivity is *really* bad for usability of crypto systems, so I largely agree with you; on the other hand, existing coinjoin systems rely on interactivity of some sort or other - either via a central server (see sharedcoin, darkwallet) or less-central-y but involving a lot of interaction over a message channel (see joinmarket). So one could argue that an extra interaction step is not such a big deal here.\n\nCoinshuffle is a protocol that can enhance coinjoin, and again: it requires another bunch of interaction.\n\nThe extra interactivity here (for nonce commitment) feels intuitively like the inevitable cost of the effectively infinite compactifying achieved by overlaying all the signatures.

Historically, with very few exceptions, people have always paid fees, even in a world where there was ample space in blocks! So history doesn\'t support youir claim, and furthermore, IMO, restricting the number of transactions miners can include in a block just absolutely ensures they will be getting fewer total fees. Why would you take the power of miners to decide away from them? Surely you haven\'t forgotten they, as providers of a service, have the power to set their fees according to the market; not too low (or indeed free) so as to be unprofitable, nor too high so that other miners will decide to include those txns in **their** blocks. So, if miners already have (and have always had) the power to reject low feed txns, why are you arguing for central economic planning? But then again you don\'t even seem sure of what you support, as you claim to support bigger blocks, and then claim to support an artificial fee market ("for the good of the network"); so which one is it? \n\n> Just simple facts, think what you like, just don\'t spread disinformation\n\nNo, it\'s not "think what I like" when you\'re making false claims, and then refuse to back them up.

The actual issue is an easy fix, it\'s the understanding how Bitcoin transactions and signatures work that is the difficult part.\n\nA signature has two valid representations, which are linked together.  One is one value, and the second is that first value subtracted from the order of the curve.\n\nBoth values constitute a valid signature, but in order to make transaction malleability less of an issue, Bitcoin Core only accepts the lower of those two values as the "correct" value, and so it (by default at least) won\'t relay your transaction if it has the wrong value (although it will still accept it as valid if a miner puts it in a block).\n\nSo the fix is pretty easy:  If, when you convert the hex to an integer, the S value of any input\'s signature is greater than half of the order of the secp256k1 curve, change it to the order minus that S value.
