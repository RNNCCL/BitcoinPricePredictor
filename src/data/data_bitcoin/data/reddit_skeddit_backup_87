The centralization pressures are external factors such as electricity prices, cooling capacity, taxes.\n\nI\'m not sure we need disincentives for LN hub creation.

Here's the article text:\n\n-----\n\nOn Friday and Saturday, a group of key players in Bitcoin met in Hong Kong and came to an agreement over some questions that have divided the community for more than a year and caused it to split into factions.\n\nThe accord represented a first step in breaking through the impasse, and afterward, the currency, which had been rising over the previous week when the event details had been finalized, reached a value of around $430, a level last seen in mid-January.\n\nIt was then hostility over the debate reached critical levels when one of the most prominent developers declared Bitcoin a failure and announced he was quitting it altogether in a widely publicized blog post that coincided with a New York Times article. The currency immediately shed 15% of its value, demonstrating one of the persistent threats to the currency \xe2\x80\x93 the issue of governance. The fact that Bitcoin is not controlled by any one entity but by a sprawling group of developers and other economic actors means that it is not always obvious how problems will be resolved or who is responsible for resolving them.\n\nHowever, the new statement by the group calling itself the Bitcoin Roundtable seems to point to a way forward for the community.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere were a lot of arguments [during the Roundtable],\xe2\x80\x9d said Samson Mow, chief operating officer of BTCC, a China-based Bitcoin exchange and one of the organizers of the event, which had about two dozen attendees. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are not like-minded individuals who all think the same thing. However, we do have an intent to work together, which is the differentiator.\xe2\x80\x9d He noted that the group had invited some members of other factions who declined to attend.\n\nThis commitment to finding common ground was echoed by Valery Vavilov, CEO of BitFury, a Bitcoin chip, hardware and mining company that currently accounts for about 10% of the network\xe2\x80\x99s power, whose chief information officer attended: \xe2\x80\x9cFor us it\xe2\x80\x99s important not to decide on our own but to collaborate with other parties because this is the greatest open-source project ever,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe consensus reached by the Roundtable, which wrapped up its negotiations at 3:30am Saturday, presents one of the more definitive resolutions to the standoff, mainly because its members represent 80% of the network security and included five of Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s developers (now called the Core team to differentiate them from the splinter groups) and other economic actors in the ecosystem such as exchanges.\n\nMow acknowledged that the agreement was very carefully worded to account for the concerns of the various Roundtable members and that the majority of the Core developers who were not present still needed to sign on to it, but he was confident that the plan represented the most likely outcome for Bitcoin moving forward.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s futile to run Classic,\xe2\x80\x9d Mow said, referring to a new version of the software proposed by a splinter group. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is done. This is over. Anyone who thinks otherwise is probably not going to be convinced of reality. They have their head in the sand and they will only believe what they want to believe.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAs Bitcoin has become more popular, transaction volume has increased, nearing the limit for the number of transactions that can be processed at any time in what is called \xe2\x80\x9ca block.\xe2\x80\x9d A few developers and large Bitcoin companies have proposed increasing each block\xe2\x80\x99s cap, which is currently at 1 MB, even going so far as to launch new versions of the software themselves without first obtaining consensus amongst most of the developers and other Bitcoin stakeholders.\n\nTen days before this meeting, a new team of developers that broke off from the original group and calls itself Bitcoin Classic made another attempt to boost that cap \xe2\x80\x94 this time to 2 MB (previous proposals called for an 8 MB limit) \xe2\x80\x94 but within a day, the group of companies and players forming the Bitcoin Roundtable released a statement effectively rejecting the Classic team\xe2\x80\x99s proposal. Their stance held weight because the companies behind it comprised enough network power to prevent the Classic version of the software from being implemented, despite the fact that Classic has the support of Coinbase, one of the most well-funded consumer-facing companies in the space. (Coinbase did not respond to requests for comment, but after the Roundtable agreement, CEO Brian Armstrong published a statement on Medium reiterating his support for an immediate block size increase to 2 MB and having miners \xe2\x80\x9cvote\xe2\x80\x9d on competing versions of the software by running the one they prefer.)\n\nOver the weekend, the Roundtable convened in Hong Kong and sketched out a plan for increasing the network\xe2\x80\x99s capacity that did not follow the Classic proposal. The Roundtable plans to implement a software change that separately processes some of the data currently in each block so that it does not contribute to the amount of data used toward the block limit. That effectively increases the number of transactions that the network can handle at any given time without actually increasing the block size.\n\nThe group also announced that it will release the software to increase the block size by July, and potentially activate that new software by July 2017. However, Vavilov, who prefers a quicker timeline, said, \xe2\x80\x9cI think July 2017 is likely a deadline. We think it could be done faster.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMow concurred: \xe2\x80\x9cIn software development, not all dates are firm,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nWhile on the surface, the debate seemed to be about the block size, it eventually became a power struggle, with the factions vying for control over the protocol. When asked why BitFury and other companies with a large portion of the network power decided to go with the Core team, Vavilov said, \xe2\x80\x9cFor us, before we switch to another team, we need to understand if the existing team with the great experience who worked on this for many years can [upgrade the network]. For me, it would be good if Classic and Core could join forces and collaborate. Because of the Classic team, I think the Core team started to move slightly faster. The Classic team is good, but if Core can do this, why take the risk and switch?\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHis comments echoed the sentiment of many of the Chinese companies that also account for a large portion of the computing power. In a previous article, I wrote about how cultural differences between China, where many of the miners are based, and the West, where many of the developers are from, are affecting Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s progress. The Chinese Bitcoin community members I interviewed, while desiring a larger block size, were averse to switching to a new team. Some of Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s bilingual community members surmised that those in the Chinese were not comfortable \xe2\x80\x9cvoting\xe2\x80\x9d for different factions because they had grown up under China\xe2\x80\x99s one-party political system.\n\nFor instance, Jack Liao, CEO of China-based Bitexchange and LightningASIC, told me then, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Core developer team for the past two years did a great job and I trust them more than the Classic team,\xe2\x80\x9d mostly because they were new. (Liao signed the agreement this past weekend.)\n\nVavilov also said that other measures could be taken to help ease the problem of the transaction volume bumping up against the cap with other technological advancements currently in development, such as the Lightning network and side chains, that allow transactions to be processed not directly on the Bitcoin network, but connected to it.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI think multiple competing teams are okay, but those teams should develop something but also somehow make consensus,\xe2\x80\x9d said Vavilov, then concluded. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I think competition is good.\xe2\x80\x9d": 2, "Didn't the price start increasing several days before the meeting?": 18, 'Forbes wont let me view their site unless I turn off adblockers and allow them to track me. \n\n**nope**': 2, ">It was then hostility over the debate reached critical levels when one of the most prominent developers declared Bitcoin a failure and announced he was quitting it altogether in a widely publicized blog post that coincided with a New York Times article.\n\nMike's ragequit is the new Casascius Coin image.

The most known form of that is buying drugs online. But there are more authorities than drug enforcement agencies.\n\nThe most important of which is central banks - their authority sets the inflation rate, and you can disobey that authority by using bitcoin (whose inflation rate is known ahead of time).\n\nHowever for some people it is simply not necessary to use bitcoin for everyday transactions. Let's say you keep your savings in bitcoin and your spending money in fiat. If your spending money loses less to inflation than you'd have spent in bitcoin transaction fees, you'd be better off using fiat for spending (all else equal).\n\nThis depends heavily on a) what your fiat inflation rate is compared to bitcoin and b) what bitcoin transaction fees are.\n\nIf transaction fees go way up, people will stop using it for everyday transactions. Their spending money may lose to inflation, but their savings will not. Unfortunately that means those without significant savings will be priced out.\n\nThat's why I foresee a high-capacity, low fee, lower security network coming to take that niche.

A middleman with a monopoly is an authority, in my view.\n\nWhile it\'s true that most of those are not true monopolies, they\'re definitely not competing in a free market.': 2, "Just because it's the best known doesn't mean that's what everyone actually uses it for.": 1, "I would say i've used bitcoin quite a bit and I've never bought drugs or any other illegal shit with it.
