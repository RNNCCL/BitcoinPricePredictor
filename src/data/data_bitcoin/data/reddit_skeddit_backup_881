So being "for net neutrality" means you want to **keep it that way**.  \n\nSo lets say your ISP disagrees with Bitcoin, or a rival company that owns a website that you frequent, or BitTorrent; if net-neutrality is broken, they can **inspect your traffic and see what you are doing**.\n\nThey could\n\n**blackmail** Netflix into paying more so their users can actually _use_ netflix without stuttering (because they intentionally **throttled** all of your packets going to netflix)\n\n **block** traffic if your using say bittorrent (even if your doing so legally)\n\n**report you to the police** if you sent your mom a photo of her granddaughter and the isp thinks its child porn\n\n**blacklist** websites that might compete with it or have an opinion not in line with the owners of the company (political or ideological like bitcoin), \n\n**use your imagination at how many misunderstandings/events that could happen if you can envision what your network traffic would look like to an algorithm sifting through your daily web traffic**\n\n This is bad for so many reasons.\n\nb)  Right now a federal appeals court just struck down Net Neutrality and sided with giant corporations like Verizon, giving them the power to do what I just described.

Rarely, but possible: if only one company is allowed to make food and it charges $50 for a loaf of bread just because, so-called price controls are going to help.

So the difficulty has been increasing, because the hash rate has been increasing, because ASIC miners make hashing cheaper. A rational mining ecosystem will invest as much in hardware and electricity and cooling costs as there is value in unmined coins. ASICs let miners get more hashing power for less electrical cost, so they can drive the difficulty up for the same investment in mining.\n\nAs the number of outstanding coins declines, we could see some of that hashing power going offline, especially if the total revenue of mining declines (i.e. if transaction fees don\xe2\x80\x99t fill in the deficit, and there aren\xe2\x80\x99t any price increases to offset the halvings of the block reward). However, the difficulty should find an equilibrium where miners in aggregate are just barely breaking even. If the difficulty is any lower, it incentivizes people to bring more capacity online, and if the difficulty is too high, someone is operating at a loss, and will want to stop mining so that they stop losing money on electricity.\n\n\nSo the difficulty emerges as a sort of consensus based on the mix of hardware out there, the cost of electricity, the price of bitcoins, and how many are left to mine. The consensus difficulty for miners using ASICs will always be higher than for miners using GPUs. So, the difficulty may decline, but it will decline to the level where ASIC miners are just barely breaking even, and the GPU miners will still be priced out.': 2, 'Perhaps a more concise statement is that difficulty may decline over time as the block reward decreases, but it will decrease only to the point where the miners with the best hardware are just barely breaking even on their investment.': 1, "sure, i'll check it out. i've always found it interesting but i'm not too much of a hardware guy, so some of the mining stuff is over my head.": 1, '>If the difficulty is any lower, it incentivizes people to bring more capacity online, and if the difficulty is too high, someone is operating at a loss, and will want to stop mining so that they stop losing money on electricity.\n\nthanks. so what do you mean "any lower"? does the difficulty decrease? let\'s say for the sake of argument, if everyone stopped mining, would difficulty levels drop significantly? I know that won\'t happen, but like you said, if miners operate a loss, eventually they will stop. Maybe not GPU mining would come back, but would there be a middle ground with chips not as advanced as ASICS would be needed? ': 1, "You're welcome :)\n\nIf you want to read more about the interesting dynamics of mining, I found this article really helpful:\nhttp://bitcoinmagazine.com/12914/bitcoins-made-in-china/": 2, "I meant any lower than the natural consensus difficulty. Anytime the difficulty is relatively low and mining is becoming really profitable, more miners are going to rush in and drive the hash rate up, and then the difficulty will compensate back up at the next difficulty adjustment.\n\nLikewise if everyone suddenly stopped mining, the next difficulty adjustment we should see the difficulty decrease dramatically. My point is that even if that were to happen, the difficulty wouldn't stay at that level. Miners (with ASICs) would see the profit opportunity, and rush in, driving the hash rate up, and pushing the difficulty back up as high as they can tolerate.\n\nAn interesting consideration is that I'm describing an equilibrium system, where anytime the difficulty deviates from its economically rational level, it gets pushed back towards the equilibrium position. But the difficulty can still be quite volatile around that average value.\n\nI expect that especially around the time when the hash rate growth starts to slow down because mining margins are narrowing we could see a lot of big swings in the difficulty as the mining ecosystem figures out where that equilibrium difficulty is. And around that time we will see people trying to mine with less advanced chips by closely monitoring the hash rate and difficulty and bringing capacity online only when they think there's an opportunity to mine profitably, the way some mining pools will hop from altcoin to altcoin trying to mine only when its most profitable.\n\nAs for less advanced chips, I can see a scenario where people keep working on developing more and more efficient ASICs, but eventually the process of developing and manufacturing these super-ASICs is so expensive that it's not worth the marginal energy savings. Right now between ASICs and GPUs, the ASICs are expensive, but you can recover those costs from the efficiency of the chip. The comparison might look different if GPUs were to suddenly plummet in price relative to ASICs.\n\nBut I don't think that's going to happen. There are long term trends about technology getting cheaper, faster, and more efficient all the time (think Moore's Law), and I see no reason why ASIC designs wouldn't follow that same kind of progression. ": 2, ">I expect that especially around the time when the hash rate growth starts to slow down because mining margins are narrowing we could see a lot of big swings in the difficulty as the mining ecosystem figures out where that equilibrium difficulty is.

So less advanced chips wouldn't even have a chance. thanks for your explanations, they are very interesting!": 1}, ('Gem launches its easy-bake Bitcoin security platform to help mainstream the cryptocurrency', 3): {}, ('Crowdfunding platform Lighthouse alpha preview video', 89): {'yes, and that is one aspect why it will only matter to bitcoin projects and even for those it would be better to also allow other payment methods and an easier workflow that does not involve dragging and dropping key files.

There are some limitations and problems that need to be addressed, but have been put off on the back burner by the dev team as "not important for now".   \n\nI have warned that industries will be evaluating Bitcoin *today* for viability in their business processes, and if it comes up lacking, they\'ll simply walk away, and make their own. Now this is happening. Im not suggesting we change bitcoin into something completely incomprehensible, but I think saying we\'ll address its most problematic limitations "in 5 years when we need it" (Gavin quote).. is poor judgment.  And it will result in Bitcoin itself being passed up as a useful tool for many industries.   Im assuming here that nobody wants that.  Maybe im wrong.

I believe they make products that appear nice, and can make people think that they are quality at first glance, but infact have a shorter lifespan due to the manufacturing and cost cutting. \n\nTake for example a cooling fan for your home. With the current system, the biggest motivator when purchasing a fan in store is usually the size, and price. Companies have to make cheaper fans to compete. Now in a society where people were more cautious in spending their money, they would probably buy a fan that would last 10 years instead of replacing a cheap fan every 2 years. \n\nI just think that when money actually gains value by holding it, then people will be more picky with what they buy, and that means that what they make their buying decisions on will shift towards longevity and quality of the product, and less towards the cheapest, easiest product to buy.\n\nAs far as the global currency, I'm talking about a time in the future, possibly 100 years or more, where everyone uses the same currency, and there are no dollars or euros to speak of.\n\nAs for the smart property/car example, it's just the blockchain technology that enables this, not bitcoin the currency, but Bitcoin the network.\n\n\n\n": 1}, ('Bitcoin gets boost as U.S. watchdog approves first swap', 6): {'You are here all the time.

So why is that? Let me suggest why that is and why it doesn't surprise me.  The TL;DR explanation is because bitcoin is being hoarded.  The longer answer is bitcoin is rightly seen as a better store of value than dollars with a large potential upside.  Bitcoin holders tend to hold onto their bitcoin and spend junk currency like dollars instead.  This isn't a bad thing, it's just the nature of the game right now.  Every day there is nearly 2 million dollars worth of bitcoin mined into existence and most of this bitcoin quietly vanishes into someone's savings, waiting for a future day when its value has appreciated closer to a fair value for what bitcoin truly is.\n\n\n\nSo does it concern me that everyone isn't spending bitcoin?  No--I expect it.  I don't spend much bitcoin myself because it would be silly to sell something at $480 that is easily worth $10,000 (and very likely will be shortly).  I expect many other bitcoin users feel the same way.  Businesses that want the digital gold that is bitcoin will have to discount quite a bit in order to get people to release some.
