A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution. \n\nNote: **"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash"**\n\nAs if that isn\'t clear enough, Satoshi emphasized the cost of transfer and the ability to do "small casual transactions" with Bitcoin even more further down the white paper:\n\n    Commerce on the Internet has come to rely almost exclusively on financial institutions serving as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the inherent weaknesses of the trust based model. Completely non-reversible transactions are not really possible, since financial institutions cannot avoid mediating disputes. The cost of mediation increases transaction costs, limiting the minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions, and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible services. \n\nAnd in the announcement mailing list, said Bitcoin could handle thousands of transactions per second on the blockchain:\n\nhttp://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09964.html\n\n    The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think. A typical transaction would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact). Each transaction has to be broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction. Visa processed 37 billion transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day. That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.\n\n    If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal. \n\nYou\'ve seen these quotes before yet willfully misrepresent what Bitcoin is.\n\n>With sidechains, LN and voting pools, you\'ll be able to make international BTC payments for nearly zero fee.\n\nAs you\'ve been informed of numerous times, voting pools are a type of centralized system (permissioned ledger).

The claim was that you can see how useful OB is by asking how often users are going to use Bitcoin to purchase. There aren\'t many. And you can use Shopify/Woocomerce+Wordpress to accomplish this as well. OB\'s claim is that on Shopify you have to go through a gateway such as Coinbase or Bitpay so you can\'t decide your own personal BTC wallet. So WP+WC allows that.\n\n> OpenBazaar is not a Bitcoin project.\n\nIt is if Shopify is. But the truth is that OB could have been built 20 years ago and offers nothing new.

I\'ve listed the criticisms below. I have bolded items that seem worth discussing. I address these at the end. I have strikethroughed items that are just insults and baseless accusations (I left most off the list). I have italicised items that are essentially meaningless because they are baseless - lacking explanation or evidence. At the bottom of the list I quote a standard definition of trolling for the reader to compare and draw a conclusion.\n\n\n* ~~OpenBazaar is stupid~~\n* **Bitcoin is "uncensorable", but Openbazaar is only "uncensored"**\n* **If someone shuts down your Bitcoin "relay node", you havent been censored because your coins remain accessible. If someone shuts down your OpenBazaar "relay node" then your store goes offline.**\n* *OpenBazaar is not a Bitcoin project.*\n* ~~OpenBazaar developers have misrepresented shopify fees - "straight up lying" - because they stated Shopify fees are 2.9% + 50c, but did not also state that purchases in bitcoin on shopify do not incur the same fees.~~\n* ~~OpenBazaar developers are incompetent.~~\n* **Although OpenBazaar may remove middlemen, they only do so in such a way that the value added by the middlemen is lost with no significant advantage gained.**\n* *OpenBazaar will fail because too few of the podcast\'s listeners have purchased items from Shopify using Bitcoin*\n* ~~Open bazaar developers have a lack of cognizance of issues.~~\n* ~~*Openbazaar developers have lied that sellers on the platform will not need to advertise because customers will magically find them.*~~\n* **OpenBazaar will fail because it competes with Amazon and ~every customer will use Amazon instead of OpenBazaar.**\n* **OpenBazaar will fail because customers will need search functions to find sellers and products and this means that OpenBazaar will compete with Google and ~every customer will use Google and therefore not OpenBazaar.**\n* *OpenBazaar is 5 years away from basic functionality including basic functions that Sendcart has.*\n* *OpenBazaar provides no added value over Wordpress, Shopify, etc*\n* ~~Sam Patterson\'s article on Decentralised article is the worst article ever and terrible~~\n* **Drop Zone does what OpenBazaar claims to do.**\n* **OpenBazaar developers avoid answering questions by saying they have already answered questions.**\n\n\n**Descriptives**\n\nType of Comment | Number | Proportion (%)\n---|---|----\nPoints Worth Rebutting | 7 | 41%\nInsults | 6 | 35%\nBaseless Claims | 4 | 24%\nTotal Insults/Baseless Claims | 10 | 59%\n\n*Note. Most insults and accusation were left out of this list. The true number is substantially higher.*\n\n**Characteristics of a Troll via [Rationalwiki](http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Don\'t_feed_the_Troll)**\n\nA troll usually has little or no interest in contributing to the development of the site in question and is interested in some or all of the following:\n\n * Deliberately angering people.\n * Breaking the normal flow of debate/discussion.\n * Disrupting the smooth operation of the site.\n * Deliberately being annoying for the sake of being obnoxious. For instance, using abusive names to refer to all the members on the site.\n * Pretending to be profoundly ignorant or stupid, gleaning some weird sense of having "won" when other users subsequently come to believe this.\n * Making itself the main topic of interest or discussion.[2]\n\n**Bolded Items**\n\nThe 7 items bolded above are addressed. Note that apart from the 2 items regarding censorship, each criticism applies equally well to Drop Zone which the podcasters claim to be the exemplar decentralised marketplace. And I\'ll argue that even those 2 apply almost equally well to Drop Zone.\n\n**1-2/7. Bitcoin is "uncensorable", but OpenBazaar is only "uncensored"**\n\nThe podcasters\' root concern appears to be a peculiar definition of censorability as opposed to censoredness. In broad terms, they appear to draw a distinction between Bitcoin and OpenBazaar by saying that Bitcoin cannot be censored, but OpenBazaar would only remain "uncensored" in the absence of an active effort by government to censor it. Comparison is drawn with Drop Zone. I suspect because Dropzone stores its listings on the Bitcoin blockchain. \n\nThe podcasters describe Bittorrent as uncensored, but censorable. So, it is clear that when they describe OpenBazaar as not censorship-resistant, what they mean is it is possible to censor, just as Bittorrent is.\n\nIt seems that a reasonable person would describe both Bittorrent and OpenBazaar as censorship-resistant. If the podcasters find this unacceptable, they might consider suing companies who describe their watches as waterproof.\n\nAfter all, nothing is absolutely, verifiably uncensorable. Just as there are no free lunches and nothing travels faster than the speed of light. \n\nAnd, lastly, a Drop Zone listing is as censorship-resistant as its seller. And sellers are as resistant as their anonymity. A Drop Zone seller who has lost their anonymity is no more resistant than an OpenBazaar seller - and now has a permanent record of their activities in the blockchain.\n\n**3/7. Although OpenBazaar may remove middlemen, they only do so in such a way that the value added by the middlemen is lost with no significant advantage gained.**\n\nThe essential services provided by ecommerce platforms are:\n\n\n\nService | Traditional | OpenBazaar\n---|---|----\nMarketing | Central, VC-funded | Word of Mouth or Aggregate of Independent Sellers\nNetwork Effect | Result of Marketing | Result of Open Source Standardisation\nEscrow | Central Database | Automated Bitcoin\nDispute Resolution | Central Staff | Open Market\nHosting | Central Server | Self or Open Market\nSearch | Central or Google | P2P, Open Market, or Google\nSupport | Staff or Site Forum | Open Source Community or Open Market\nRegulatory Compliance | Jurisdictional | Self or Hosted/Jurisdictional\nPayment Processing | Credit Cards (or Bitcoin processor) | Bitcoin\n\n**4/7. OpenBazaar will fail because it competes with Amazon and ~every customer will use Amazon instead of OpenBazaar.**\n\nThis claim is easily addressed. 1) an open source protocol doesn\'t *fail* in the same sense that a business can. As long as n >= 2 peers are connected, it\'s working. 2) If we define success as obtaining a market niche, then let\'s say we need 1,000,000 users. That\'s 1.42e-4 of the world\'s current population to have a particular set of preferences such that OpenBazaar meets their needs as well as or better than other services. \n\nNext, let\'s consider the fact that of the 7 billion people alive today, [2 billion do not have bank accounts and 40% of them live in China, India, and Indonesia.](http://www.vocativ.com/money/industry/nearly-40-percent-of-people-with-no-bank-account-live-in-3-countries/).\n\nSuddenly, success looks like a trickle of the world\'s ocean of trade.\n\n**5/7. OpenBazaar will fail because customers will need search functions to find sellers and products and this means that OpenBazaar will compete with Google and ~every customer will use Google and therefore not OpenBazaar.**\n\nOpenBazaar sellers will be searchable in much the same as torrents are searchable. There will be p2p search and standard website listings (e.g. piratebay or rather [BazaarBay](https://bazaarbay.org/)). And then, as with torrents, many people will probably find sellers just by googling what they\'re looking for. \n\n**6/7. Drop Zone does what OpenBazaar claims to do.**\n\nWell then, what do OpenBazaar and Dropzone claim to be?\n\nDropzone is a solution to the problem of restricted sales in censored markets. [From the [whitepaper](https://github.com/17Q4MX2hmktmpuUKHFuoRmS5MfB5XPbhod/dropzone_ruby/blob/master/Drop%20Zone%20-%20Whitepaper.pdf)]\n\nOpenBazaar is an open source project to create a decentralized network for peer to peer commerce online\xe2\x80\x94using Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x94that has no fees and no restrictions. [[Openbazaar blog: What is Open Bazaar?](https://blog.openbazaar.org/what-is-openbazaar/)]\n\nDropzone claims to enable trade of restricted goods under censorship by nation-states. OpenBazaar claims to create a network that does not charge fees or restrict access or use.\n\nA subtle difference maybe, but it\'s written on their labels.\n\n**7/7. OpenBazaar developers avoid answering questions by saying they have already answered questions.**\n\n[Here are OpenBazaar developers directly addressing criticisms in the comments of the Soundcloud linked.](https://soundcloud.com/bitcoinuncensored/e13-the-plan-backfired-110215)\n\nYou can scroll through /u/junseth\'s Reddit, [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/bitcoinuncensored/e13-the-plan-backfired-110215), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/junseth) to find that he hardly, if ever, mentions OpenBazaar without a developer appearing to politely and pleasantly answer criticism. In fact, the developers appear remarkably responsive to community discussion in general.\n\nAlso note that this comment thread began with my asking /u/junseth, \n\n>"In which ways is openbazaar vulnerable to censorship?

(November 2015) \xe2\x80\x93  WatchMyBit (WMB) allows artists and their management teams to distribute video content and, most importantly, collect and distribute content royalties anywhere in the world regardless of borders and boundaries.  Writer, director, producer & composer Peter McEvilley is a filmmaker whose award winning film, On Falling, is the first full length movie to be uploaded to the Bitcoin powered platform.\n\nIndependent films are passion projects, and rarely make any money,  \xe2\x80\x9cThe idea that my film could earn money on every view is just amazing.  And that viewers don\xe2\x80\x99t need credit card or a bank is revolutionary\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\nThe YouTube trailer of the film can be seen here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKPVDbLyjII\n\nThe film can be seen in it\xe2\x80\x99s entirety here http://www.watchmybit.com/Video/Show/820d24a1-4b53-4786-bfb3-23ab2fdeff59\n\nA portion of every view goes to the Everbody Is A Star Foundation (.http://www.everybodystar.org/)\n\n\nHoward Sapper, the executive producer of the film and an early co-founder of WatchMyBit explains more advantages:, \xe2\x80\x9cThe ability to instantly split incoming payments among artists, writers, management, distributors and even charities has never been possible before,\xe2\x80\x9d he continues, \xe2\x80\x9cWith WatchMyBit, the savings in payment processing, bookkeeping and legal fees alone are astonishing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sapper goes on to explain another way to use the innovative platform: \xe2\x80\x9cRaising production funds has become so much easier now that we can instantly collect and distribute payments with each view.  This means backers aren\xe2\x80\x99t just sharing the risk, but also the direct rewards for each and every view.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n\nDoug Scribner, CEO of WatchMyBit explains his vision for filmmakers and other artists:  \xe2\x80\x9cBorders and boundaries are irrelevant to streaming videos and music, we believe payments to artists should be just as fast and free.  By using Bitcoin (and soon PayPal)  micropayments, the whole team can get paid every single day, not just 12 times a year.\n\n\nMcEvilley has already started funding for his next film; a short film to accompany a track from his latest release,  Analog.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s much easier to get funding, because now, my backers will earn a percentage off every view, just like the lead actors.  This gives everyone a huge incentive not just to make great art, but to share it with everyone they know\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\nWMB is not just for filmmakers. Musicians, Vloggers, Lets Plays, web series and content creators anywhere can monetize their original videos.\n\n\nAbout WatchMyBit\n\nEstablished in 2014, WatchMyBit LLC is the first, ad free, video content delivery service powered by Bitcoin.
