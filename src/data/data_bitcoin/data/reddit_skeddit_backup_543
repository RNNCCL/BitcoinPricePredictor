Keep in mind that Mycelium uses an HD wallet by default, so a string of words is used to generate a new private key / public address pair after each transaction (send or receive). With your Account open, bring up the menu and choose Backup. You will write down a series of words, type them back in to prove that you wrote them down correctly and then store them in a very safe place -- one where no one else will find them by accident, yet will be able to get to them in case of your death. If you lose your phone, you simply install Mycelium on your next device and choose Restore Wallet at install. Re-enter the words you wrote down and all of your keys and addresses (and your respective balances) will return.\n\nAny nicknames (tags) you apply to your wallet names or individual transactions will not be restored, however.\n\nFinally, with your Mycelium up, touch on the QR for "Receive funds" and copy the deposit address to the clipboard. Either paste it into Coinbase or email it to the PC where you do your Coinbase transactions. Send your Coinbase balance to the Receive address shown by Mycelium and your funds will start to come over. You really should get in the habit of using a different address for each transaction, so make sure to grab a new address before initiating each transfer if you have BTC sitting in multiple places. You may wish to do what I did and empty your ChangeTip account into Mycelium first just to get a feel for the process. Again, get your (current) deposit address from Mycelium (it changes after every transaction) and then on the My Money page at ChangeTip, initiate a withdrawal to the deposit address you got from Mycelium. If you have a few dollars in ChangeTip, practice sending small amounts back and forth between the two systems. It\'s free to withdraw from ChangeTip and only costs a couple cents to deposit back into ChangeTip straight from Mycelium.\n\nThere are numerous advanced capabilities of Mycelium -- these instructions are just to get your funds transferred and protected.': 3, 'You could also type the exchange rate into the transaction label and use just one HD account.

It affects the cost basis of the entire wallet and it also affects which BTC you spent according to FIFO or LIFO. If you\'re going to spend BTC that went up in value, you\'re going to pay two different tax rates based upon how long you held it -- either 365 days or less or 366 days or days or more. The tax rate on the gains drops significantly on day 366.  \n\nNow if you choose LIFO and buy a big chunk to start, it will "sit at the bottom" while newer BTC comes and goes off the "top". Picture a single, multicolored bar in a bar chart. At the bottom is the oldest BTC, and as you make your way up the bar you are approaching the newest BTC added to the wallet. If you go to buy a $200 hard drive, you may be lulled into thinking "Cool, I have $250 in my wallet" when in reality you have $10 purchased a week ago, $75 purchased last month, $15 purchased a few months ago, $35 purchased before that, $25 purchased almost a year ago, and the last $40 you need for that hard drive purchased over a year ago.\n\nAll in one wallet, you have six different cost bases for the BTC that is going into the purchase, four that went up in value, two that dropped in value and also two different tax rates on those that went up, assuming one of the four that increased in value was purchased over a year ago. You have to figure out how much money you earned on each of the four groups of BTC that increased in value while you held it, determine how long you held each grouping, and pay either 42 or 23 cents of every dollar earned in each group, depending on whether or not you held the BTC for over a year. If your records cannot convince the IRS that you separated your holdings and can verify how long you held each BTC before spending it, they may eliminate your claim to lower tax rates on gains or even worse, may disregard your assertion that you lost money on certain transactions.\n\nSee what kind of a disaster that is? Sadly, that is the actual current state of tax reporting for BTC use in the US. Bitcoin is property in the US, not a currency, and this outcome is the ramification of that decision. That is why I create a new wallet each time I buy BTC and tag it with the exchange rate and date of purchase. That is also why I only spend BTC from wallets where I\'m losing money. Sure, I could take a few dollars off my income statement to reduce my overall tax bill, but it is so not worth it. You\'re only required to report every gain over 50c. You\'re not required to report any losses, although you could be giving up a good bit of money if your BTC lost a lot of value before you spent it.\n\nI do not recommend mixing BTC bought on different dates with different exchange rates. Instead, start a new wallet each time you acquire BTC and label it with the date and exchange rate. When you go to spend BTC, check the current exchange rate first and spend BTC that was bought at a slightly higher rate than the current rate. Then tag each transaction with a purpose, amount in USD and exchange rate. For example "Coffee at Duffys $5.25 @ 295". That way I can prove that I always spend BTC at a loss, no matter what. If the rate takes off and I\'m up on every wallet (like today), I\'ll stop by a LibertyX location, buy another $100 at current rates and start a new wallet tagged with the purchase date and exchange rate. The rates should go back down soon, unlocking the funds and allowing me to spend again without all the complications.': 1, "That would be super helpful. Still makes us do a little work like starting a new wallet for each purchase and showing the exchange rate in the wallet name, but just this little extra functionality would go a long way to help us recording and reporting our transaction details.

Thus they don\'t make a good long-term store of value.  But until they do go to zero, they have *some* market value, and are therefore not "nothings".\n\nIn fact, I think the US national debt, which is getting larger than the annual GDP, is already getting dangerously high.

Not only were ratings done with incorrect risk models and arm twisting, many fraudulent mortgages were created.  Either the value of the property was inflated, or the borrower\'s income, or both.  Investors weren\'t informed of the "tranche" structured finance method (i.e. being in 14th place to get payouts almost guaranteed you got nothing), and sometimes the fund operators even lied about the value of their holdings.  The whole system was corrupted, from start to finish.\n\nBut having been burned in the 2007 collapse and recession, people are much more wary of what they are investing in, and know what to look for.

There is only so much that can be done politically to squeeze other spending or raise taxes, and if the debt keeps growing, eventually interest compounds exponentially.  Since the world has a finite appetite to buy the debt, they have to offer higher interest rates to sell it, which only makes things worse.\n\nWe don't know exactly when the problem becomes uncontrollable, but economists can make reasonable estimates, and look at part experience in other countries.  As long as the national debt is growing faster than the economy in real terms (after inflation), you will eventually reach the run-away point.\n": 1, 'Perhaps the same question should be asked of the Fed? \n\nA "free market", you say?

But then so have many other commodities.  And any kind of debtor can default, it\'s a risk.  But gold can be stolen and houses can burn down.  Any kind of asset has risks associated.\n\n> Debt is denominated in USD - just make more!\n\nThe Fed increases the money supply by "monetizing debt".  They buy Treasuries and the other kinds of debt, and pay for it by crediting the selling bank\'s account with them.  But there is a finite (though large) amount of such debt.  They can\'t monetize forever without accepting lower grade loans.  The financial markets will recognize the lower quality collateral behind the dollar, and value it accordingly on the foreign exchange market.\n\nSucking up all the outstanding Treasuries as currency backing also will increase the price on them, lowering yield, possibly below the inflation rate.  That would make it hard for the Federal Government to issue more debt.  So they can\'t really monetize *all* the debt, side effects put a limit on it.': 2, 'Entirely possible - but that would be even more bullish for bitcoin': 2, "Excellent use of the word 'golem'.\n\nAlso, agree with all of above.": 1, '> "Once FDR ended gold redeemability, the U.S. government\xe2\x80\x99s currency was effectively an I.O.U. nothing." - *page 3 of article*\n\nThis is widely misunderstood and incorrect.  See table 7 of the Federal Reserve\'s [current balance sheet](http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/current/).  A "Federal Reserve Note" (FRN) is the official name for paper [U.S. money](http://usrarecurrency.com/WebPgFl/2004$50PremiumFederalReserveSets/2004$50FederalReserveNoteSnEE00000800A.jpg), it says so right on them.  These notes are backed by collateral: a small amount of gold certificates, and a lot of Treasury, US agency, and mortgage securities debt.  If you are a bank that was issued FRN\'s for circulation, you can return them and get your collateral back.  An individual can fairly easily swap their paper money for the same kinds of debt used as collateral.\n\nThus they are not "IOU nothings".  They are debt-backed money, and exchangeable back for the debt which backs them.  However, the debt securities typically have denominations of $1000 or higher, and FRN denominations of 1 to 100 dollars are more convenient for daily transactions.  We can debate whether debt-backed currency is a good idea, but you cannot say that debt is nothing. It\'s a claim on future goods and services which can be traded for other things you want.': 2}, ('Why has Kraken blockey my 8 BTC deposit and refuses to answer my support tickets?

I am not a fan of consensus driven decision making for this reason - it tends naturally towards stasis. The reason is if some people say "no it\'s too risky", the change is made and things are fine, nobody remembers the objections. The reputation of the naysayers hardly suffers. Everyone is just happy that the improvement happened and wants to move on. If some people say "no it\'s too risky" and then there are problems, they look prescient and wise and can easily have a told-you-so attitude. And unfortunately then the people who were trying to improve things can easily lose influence and things grind to a halt. "You\'re not being careful enough with other peoples money" is the sort of argument that socially has a lot of weight, and can quickly result in nobody doing anything because nobody wants to stick their neck out.\n\nThis is the story of many large organisations that get big and slow, and given how many years this block size thing has been playing out over, I think it\'s easy to say it\'s happening in Bitcoin too. \n\nAt any rate, Bitcoin cannot stand still. Usage is growing and failing to tackle that growth will result in either a technical collapse or (another) fork of the software by people who are building companies on the assumption of mass adoption, but whatever happens stasis will not be it.

Supply would always be fairly constant, but demand would still greatly vary depending on the day, time of the year, and also by who knows what kind of future SatoshiDices or new ways of using sidechains. Predicting the clearing times and needed fees would be terrible burden for transactors and mining revenues would become highly volatile. There would be constant political issues about increasing/decreasing the block size. Blocks would always need to be close to full and during quiet seasons there would be the same "securing the network issue" enhanced with artificially limited block sizes with less transaction fees in them. High seasons with expensive transactions could throw some transactors out of the system.\n\nI know it\'s good to look into future but with 1MB blocks and difficulty in da moon I think the relevant issue today is raising the max block size and not talk about limiting it in the name of network security.': 1, 'Transaction size is a technical limitation and a far cry from the economic consequences of changing the money supply': 8, "We don't need full consensus, key dev's and 51% of the hashing power will do just fine, everyone else will fall into line. \n\nHis talk starts about here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=96ULlHhia_Q#t=2860": 8, 'No, that\'s why I put "mandatory" in quotes.

And ultimately its the miner\'s choice whether they are willing to include a low or no fee txn.

Up until a certain fee threshold, chances are these are the users who don't get much value from Bitcoin, so losing them isn't a shame.\n\n(I say 'up until a certain value' because at some point fees become high enough to turn away poorer users who do get significant value from Bitcoin.)\n\nI'm not trying to rehash the old arguments about fees, I'm just saying that I don't think we hit a hard wall the moment 1 MB blocks become common, or even for sometime afterwards.\n\n> You haven't defined or justified any numeric goals there so it's hard to argue with these statements as they are so vague.\n\nI apologize; making non-falsifiable statements was not my intention.\n\n* The number of full nodes currently partly indicates our capacity for serving P2P SPV nodes (which is nice, but as you say, not essential)---but it also indicates the number of people and business who take their security seriously.  If full nodes are declining or stagnant as Bitcoin usage is increasing, it means we're trending towards centralization and trusted third parties.  As a metric, full node usage should probably roughly correlate with transaction volume---for every doubling in transaction volume, we should see a doubling of full nodes.\n\n* According to [some back of the envelope calculations I did](http://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/32562/when-to-worry-about-1-confirmation-payments/32564#32564), double spending confirmed transactions enters the realm of feasibly profitable at around 1% network hash rate for once-confirmed transactions and 23% for six-confirmed transactions.  When I wrote that, some pools had more than 23%, but that may no longer be the case---so I guess we're making progress, albeit slowly.\n\n    (I did like your BCF post.

That\'s why today, a block reward is necessary to have sufficient security of the system. If the reward for miners is high, then more miners mine => more security for the system.\n\nBut if you imagine 1000x more people using Bitcoin, fees alone can easily be enough to pay for good security.\n\nWhat you need to take away from this is that it\'s a self regulating system. If the fees are not enough to pay all the miner\'s electricity costs, then more and more miners will stop mining until the reward is enough again for the rest of the miners. The security will be lower, because fewer people are mining, but the system will still work just as before.\n\n>Won\'t the work involved remain the exact same (not factoring in increased computing power)? Therefore, are we depending on miners to do the same exact thing they\'re doing now, for way less reward, or the currency literally grinds to a halt due to blocks ceasing to be mined?\n\nYou will never have *nobody* mining, or "the currency literally grinding to a halt", as long as bitcoins have value. Theoretically, Bitcoin works just fine if there\'s only 10 people in the whole world who are mining.

If miners drop out, the hash rate goes down and it takes longer on average than 10 minutes to find a block. The difficulty would go down, making it more probable to find a block, making the average 10 minutes again.\n\nWithin this 2016 block timeframe, every block is mined with the same difficulty.\n\n[- Current Difficulty & stats](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty)  \n[- Difficulty explained in the bitcoin wiki](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Difficulty)  \n- [The Bitcoin clock](http://bitcoinclock.com/) (helps to visualize Bitcoin\'s "episodes")\n\nFor the rest of your post... If I understand you correctly, you\'re asking whether an already mined block can be smuggled into the chain with different content, but the same hash? That\'s an interesting question. I think it\'s safe to say that for all intends and purposes, that\'s impossible. While it\'s a fact that different blocks *can* theoretically result in the same hash (should be intuitively clear when knowing that when hashing, *long* data gets reduced to *short* data), the possibilty of finding 2 different, *yet valid* bitcoin blocks resulting in the same hash is so abysmally small, there\'s really no point in searching for it. It\'s like asking why you can\'t randomly get the same private key that someone else already used. \n\nThe next issue would be that even when having found such a unicorn, you wouldn\'t get other people to use your block. They would see they have it already and deny loading it from you again. You could perhaps spread it to someone who hasn\'t loaded the blockchain yet and result in him having corrupted data, but that\'s about it. At no point would anyone\'s bitcoins be in danger.\n\n>but the general population, not understanding the depth of the process, would cease to understand this, and hence, not feel secure.\n\nPerhaps. But the general population is not supposed to understand the depth of the process. They should, because understanding stuff is good. But not understanding stuff doesn\'t need to stop them from using it. I don\'t really know much about cars, yet I trust them to drive me around at speeds at which they can easily kill me. Don\'t even get me started on airplaines.\n\nYou probably don\'t know much about the details of the traditional banking system either, and  how your money is moved around there. You just trust it because everyone trusts it. And that is how it is with everything. Bitcoin is still far away from that point where everyone just uses it without having to think about it. But if its security passes the test of time, there\'s really no reason I can see why it can\'t be like that.\n\nOK, I need to end this long post now. Sorry if my english wasn\'t too good. \n\nSince you seem to be new here, maybe you want to check in on the weekly "Mentor Monday" thread to ask all your questions.': 2, '>Can anyone ELI5 what happens when all the bitcoins have been mined? What changes?\n\nNothing really "changes". There\'s no block reward anymore, so the miners will have to live off the fees they gain from transactions. But that\'s not a sudden thing, the block reward will have been gradually decreasing for decades, and when it disappears, miners will already almost completely depend on fees anyway. In principle, the block reward also doesn\'t have to completely go away, it can just continue halving forever.\n\n>Why is the limit set to 21 million and not 42 million?\n\nThe limit is 21 million just results from an initial block reward of 50 bitcoins. When you pay out 50 bitcoins every 10 minutes, and then halve that reward after 4 years, and then again after 4 years and so forth, you end up with an upper limit of 21m coins.\n\nSo the question isn\'t actually "Why 21m coins?" but rather "Why 50 coins initial block reward?". And the answer is: for no reason. It doesn\'t matter what number you pick. Could have been 500, or 7172. The only possible influence it has is psychological, because humans are bad in dealing with numbers.': 5, 'Actually, when all the bitcoins will be mined, nothing special is going to happen. During this transition period, mining income will start to rely more and more on transaction fess and less on the actual block reward. This does not mean that the transaction fees will grow, maybe its a combination of increased transaction volume, less competition in mining, more power-efficient mining equipment (reducing the costs of running it) etc etc. The number of newly mined coins will have been very very low for decades already, its a slow transition, so the final point of no more new coins might only have a psychological impact. Celebrations and cake and so on. The number was picked by satoshi, he tried to come up with something reasonable estimated on how widespread usage he guessed the system to have. He admitted its nearly impossible to make good predictions. It does not matter all that much anyway, the important thing is that its fixed and transparent.': 33, '14 million coins so soon!': 15, "Thank you for your response. I assume the number of transactions in a block does not effect the difficulty of mining that block? \n\nAlso one other tangent; (forgive my inevitably incorrect verbiage) my understanding is that if anyone attempts to alter a hashed code of a block already added to the chain, the output will change and make it immediately evident the chain was attempted to be tampered with and the change will be rejected. Although obviously extremely difficult, I assume it's theoretically possible to completely alter a block of transactions in a way that the output would remain unchanged. Using current mining techniques I assume this is essentially ludicrous and would be potentially considered impossible. But is it? I assume this is one of those cases where someone involved in mining (or programming in general) would understand the impossibility of this, but the general population, not understanding the depth of the process, would cease to understand this, and hence, not feel secure. \n\nIt jsut seems to me that the intuition of the security is so high level that it somewhat defeats the purpose because it will never be fully understood by the general population to harness widespread adoption.\n\n": 1, "who will pay these fees? people conducting transactions? won't these fees collected be miniscule compared to existing block rewards? How could fees come anywhere close to a block reward without making transactions too expensive to transact? Won't the work involved remain the exact same (not factoring in increased computing power)?
