IMO merchants educating their client base about bitcoin is a great way to share the education and generate loyalty by offering unique, exciting incentives...

Obviously this will vary.  There are more reasons that profit is lost due to chargebacks (and the fear of chargebacks) including, but not limited to: rejected orders, cost of paying employees to deal with chargbacks and related issues, paying for services to detect fraud, limiting order sizes due to fear of chargebacks, and extra money lost due to affiliate payments on items that have been subjected to a chargeback, the fact that the chargeback fee of $25 might keep you from even offering certain low cost, high volume items due to fear of chargeback etc.\nhttp://internetretailing.net/2015/02/guest-comment-tis-the-season-for-chargebacks/\n\nBitpay is free for smaller businesses, so there is no 1% fee.\nCredit card processors take 3% off the top\n\nAlso, I didn\'t "demand" that they give an additional discount. I said "please offer".\n\nIn the end - the point is it would be great if merchants could offer - at least for now - a discount equal to their normal cost associated with accepting credit cards and other forms of payment. If that\'s only 2% for you - so be it.': 1, 'Plus, note that if you offer less than 1% discount (or even less than 5% in some cases), a consumer will be worse off using bitcoin because they get more cash-back points from their credit-cards.': 6, 'This needs to be at the top under the topic.': 1, 'You can buy Steam games for at least 5% off at [SteamBitShop](https://steambitshop.com). (based on US prices)': 2, 'It would be nice enough if they just offered the same as they do for cash.': 1, "It's not non-existent. Please see my recent edit.": 1, 'There is no fee for small merchants using Bitpay. Would I rather they accept Bitcoin "more natively" and hold it - sure - but of course many won\'t.\nSo, they can save 3% easily.  Passing that on to the consumer is only fair for the time being at least.\nMaybe only merchants who "See the light" that they can help "change the world" by doing this will do it. But others might see that they can get "Free advertisting" (and even free press) from Bitcoin enthusiasts telling / posting about to other Bitcoin enthusiast that they offer a discount for Bitcoin.\nIn a world where discounts are often offered for no other reason than it\'s some president\'s birthday or something ... offering a small discount that doesn\'t actually cost you anything seems like an easy decision.': 1, "While I agree with your numbers, they don't necessarily tell the full story.  In my business, I need to cap the amounts that customers can buy on Credit Card / PayPal.  That is because the likelihood of fraud increases rapidly as transaction size increases.  A $1,000 USD order is much more likely to be fraudulent than a $10 USD order.  The risk is also much more diversified when accepting 100 orders for $10 as opposed to 1 order for $1000.\n\nBecause of the risk, we often will have to turn away legitimate customers after they have reached a certain volume in a certain time period.  Although our chargeback rate implies the cost of accepting further orders is ~0.7% * the order total, and therefore should be completely acceptable, we simply do not take further orders once the limit is reached.\n\nTherefore, payment methods such as Bitcoin allow us to continue processing orders that we would normally turn away.  For that reason, we will often offer substantial discounts for large Bitcoin orders.  Now, my business is quite unique in the sense that we provide digital products for online games, but it still shows use cases where a 5%+ discount for using Bitcoin makes sense.\n\nEither way though, merchants will not do this simply because they read a post on Reddit.  They will do this because they value the Bitcoin orders, and their competitors do as well, thereby fueling competitive discounted pricing.  Let's stop asking for things, and instead improve the Bitcoin payment system to the point that merchants are compelled to offer discounts due to competition.": 2, "Start a business and offer 5% off yourself. Merchant discounts aren't what is going to take bitcoin mainstream.

However a few ways we can look at it.  Why are you integrating Bitcoin payments, what is the goal and the strategy to reach it.  If you are just accepting them, with no plan to promote, educate or anything.... this would make sense, and you will probably add yourself to the list of businesses that have decided to pack it in because a lack of Bitcoin sales and your employees running around confused.    \n   \nOn the other side, you could build a strategy around Bitcoin as a means to perhaps upsell items, bring people in during off hours, or offer discounts for multi item, or large sales.. Really anything.  I think opp is more suggesting, yes everyone knows merchants save a bit, but also bring the consumer in to enjoy the utility.  \n  \n5% off might not do much for your bottom line, but with incorporation into a complete strategy with end goals a timeline and the proper promotions I think a Bitcoin discount can be used as a tool to accomplish many things that will positively impact the bottom line, like I said, very situational dependent... Merchants need to look at the bigger picture and plan to have all marketing channels firing with creative promotions before pulling the trigger, in my eyes.': 1, 'He never said 7% chargeback rate. Maybe 1.5% chargeback rate. But that could result in a 7% loss in revenue. Hope someone can explain that better below...': -1, "There's not enough cash discounts out there either...": 1, 'just use Purse.io for 5% off Amazon. ': -1, 'Yes, but they have to deal with bitcoin when they really want fiat.  So that means they either have to work with a payment processor to take your bitcoin and give the merchant fiat (which involves transaction fees of its own), or they have to accept bitcoin "natively" and then sell them on an exchange on their own, which also has associated exchange fees and it\'s a hassle.  So there\'s your fees, and they\'re probably higher than what CCs charge (which is like ~2-3%).\n\nI guarantee you they don\'t want to HODL bitcoin.  Their suppliers don\'t accept it, their employees don\'t want to be paid in it, they can\'t pay their rent, taxes, or utilities with it.  Also it\'s volatile as hell, and they\'re probably not in the bitcoin speculation business.\n\nNow on top of all that you\'re proposing a discount?': 1, "You realize that the overwhelming majority of merchants won't take bitcoin for FREE, right?  Now you want them to pay for the privilege of accepting them?": 3, 'Merchant here.\n\nChargebacks are negligible, if you receive enough chargebacks to even make them statistically significant your card processor will drop you [note: there are "high risk" card processors with much higher rates, but nearly all merchants are conventional boring and not "risky" in the chargeback sense]. \n\nSo we\'re working with ~3%. If you\'re using Coinbase or BitPay, they take 1%. So we\'re down to 2%. \n\nFigure the merchant had to spend some time (or pay their developer) to integrate Bitcoin payment, train their employees on how to deal with customer service RE bitcoin transactions, and deal with the occasional hiccup in processing (customer sends BTC to address outside of 15 minute window allotted by BitPay? As a merchant they probably don\'t even know what a public address is and now they have to figure out why the transaction hasn\'t confirmed).\n\nNow figure the merchant is receiving a *very small* portion of their sales in Bitcoin. For my business, in [FY 2014 only 2% of my gross revenue was in Bitcoin](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54546041/Bitcoin%20Sales%20Since%20Implementation.pdf). This month it\'s been less than 1%. And I\'m pretty active in the Bitcoin world. Other merchants haven\'t seen a single sale.\n\nSo from a conventional merchant\'s perspective (one who has no ideological or technological investment in Bitcoin), with all the overhead required to accept Bitcoin and the proportionally low amount of sales made with Bitcoin (sometimes so low that the gross revenue from Bitcoin sales is below their ~3% credit card fees), why would they provide a 5% discount when they\'re only saving 2% on CC fees but have to deal with all the above? We need to work on getting merchants to see the utility of this digital currency, not demand they accept our magic internet money and when they do adopt it, immediately demand that they give us discounts for using it.  \n\nFurthermore, if the merchant is like me and decides to actually integrate the true decentralized p2p nature of Bitcoin and accept it natively in their site, there is not a payment processing fee, but I still have to deal with network fees (for my average order size, it\'s 0.06%) and conversion to fiat to pay my bills (~1%). So in fees I\'m paying about 1.1%. \n\nBut since I accept Bitcoin natively (and hold some BTC for returns, etc), I have to deal with volatility. Had I held all the BTC, a sale made three weeks ago would have provided me with only 2/3 of the real value when I went to pay my bills at the end of the day today.\n\nBut either way the merchant is taking on a substantial amount of work and some additional risk to accept Bitcoin - and their sales from Bitcoin are relatively small - to demand that they give you an additional discount for using the same money you just asked them to begin accepting is a bit much to ask.': 30, "It's not paying for the privilege. It's marketing. They're losing that money anyway with CC's. So, it's free marketing.": 1, 'Also fraud.': 1, "\n>Agreed.  However a few ways we can look at it.  Why are you integrating Bitcoin payments, what is the goal and the strategy to reach it.  If you are just accepting them, with no plan to promote, educate or anything.... \n\nSo you're saying that accepting Bitcoin requires a proposed payment to use it and you need to educate people on the system? Recent changes in Australia (worldwide?) where you must use your pin for a credit card were hard enough yo educate people on, and don't even get me started on the chip cards. This is tech they use everyday and it's hard to get off the ground. Why in god's name would anyone want to educate everyone when the standard payment system does the job well and requires no education?\n": 1, "If a merchant has a 7% chargeback rate, that is considered extremely high. Most main payment processors will not go near a company that has a chargeback rate that high. 1.5%+ is very high.\n\nTake that into account, then say they're saving 3% on CC processing fees... We're now at ~4.5% in savings. \n\nAll that bundled together, would it be worth the merchant offering a 3% discount or would it be better for them to just keep the profits and add to their bottomline?\n\nNot arguing, more just putting it out there.\n\nEdit: In addition, CC processing fees are high in America but not nearly as high internationally.\n\nEdit 2: There are clear advantages for merchants, but focusing on cost is not the best approach.": 7, "Not necessarily. If the profit margins are high you may still take credit cards - as many do. However, believe me you'd rather not have to deal with chargebacks so if you could make the same amount of money (or more) by offering a discount for BTC payments it's a good idea.": 1, 'Thanks Rakuten! http://www.rakuten.com/loc/bitcoin/82406.html?scid=em_Promotional_20150401Daily&adid=18007': 1, '\n>Chargebacks are negligible, if you receive enough chargebacks to even make them statistically significant your card processor will drop you [note: there are "high risk" card processors with much higher rates, but nearly all merchants are conventional boring and not "risky" in the chargeback sense]. \n\nI can vouch for this. Having worked directly in hardware and support for eftpos payment network and the pinpads, I know first hand having worked for a huge chain here in Australia, that chargebacks are negligible. The most a single business has ever had is 5 in a year. They were a huge problem and they eventually left the company.

": 1, "[The Forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2015/03/27/bitcoin-blockchain-pollution-a-criminal-opportunity/) is a bit more informative about the C&C potential of OP_RETURN which has had proof-of-concept. The actual infection doesn't need to have anything to do with the blockchain.\n\nGavin had some comments against the idea of using the blockchain this way:\n\n>Gavin Andreson, chief scientist at the Bitcoin Foundation, said using C&C on the blockchain would be \xe2\x80\x9cvery expensive\xe2\x80\x9d due to the transaction fees hackers would have to pay. He also noted that botnet operators don\xe2\x80\x99t want there to be any permanent record of their crimes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe risk to them is that their command server gets seized, and then they are prosecuted for everything it ever did. It is much better if the commands are impermanent. Using the Bitcoin peer-to-peer network (instead of the blockchain) makes a lot more sense, but there are much larger peer-to-peer networks where botnet activity is easier to hide, so even then it is unlikely any botnet operator would choose to piggyback on the Bitcoin network.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nI'd argue that expense isn't a big deal; txs can be sent with no miner fee and don't even need to be confirmed, just broadcast sufficiently along the network. As far as visibility, botnets have used things as twitter and whatnot for C&C, about as public as it gets. As a possible benefit even of having no-fee transactions, if txs stay unconfirmed or even get double spent, then there isn't even any record.\n\nTL;DR it's a legitimate possibility that will probably increase in likelihood the bigger bitcoin gets, and one that will continue to come up in ongoing conversation about the potential 'dangers' of data on a public digital ledger that no one can simply shut down. \n\nAlso, no one commenting here seems to have actually read either article.

So there was no nefarious redirection here (yes, I know NSA headquarters are a drive away for me, I pass them on my way to Bitcoin Meetups in DC).\n\nOne of the biggest reasons for the delay in getting these devices made was a lot of feedback from people as, or even more, paranoid than you guys.

Flashing firmware requires that the firmware is signed, and the signature matches the signature in the settings file. Screwing with firmware to install malware or compromise security is of course possible (everything's possible), but is super difficult.

However, at present it may be that redemption is disabled even for those high-level brokers.\n\nThere are already some bids recorded on the OTCQX page, up to 31.5 $/share (meaning 315 $/BTC), but there are no sellers yet because the BIT share holders must first receive the appropriate electronic certificates to interact with the brokers; that should happen in a few days.

So because of them we added a whole lot of extra security features, contingency options, stronger RF resistant cases, and software security options. Hardware tampering with devices is technically possible, but not easy, and especially not cheap. Flashing firmware requires that the firmware is signed, and the signature matches the signature in the settings file. Screwing with firmware to install malware or compromise security is of course possible (everything's possible), but is super difficult. And then, even if they succeed, if you add your own Diceware salt to the device in the settings file, it will combine your salt with its internal entropy source, and create a wallet with a hash you can use to 100% verify to include your salt. Basically, just adding salt will make all of the expensive and supper difficult hardware and software tampering completely useless. Boxes, packaging, and hologram seals were the least important security features we included (I'm thinking it may not have been a mistake to include them in the first place, since it seems to have just freaked out a lot of people unnecessarily). All the security comes in the tons of work we did on the software and hardware side. We created these with the assumption that NSA/CIA should be able to borrow it from you, and then when you get it back, for you to still feel safe stirring millions of dollars on paper wallets it creates (as long as you reflash it with a signed firmware file, and add your own salt).\n\n\nMaybe someone can corroborate on that, but it seems like a solid response to me.
