The distinction between subjective vs objective ledgers was my big \'aha moment\' takeaway from the video. I had never considered this idea before.\n\nHis six qualities for good objective ledgers: scarce, durable, divisible, transportable, recognizable, fungible.\n\nGold is a good ledger because it is cross-culturally scarce, durable, etc. \n\nIn the modern era gold\'s *portability* is lacking (cost prohibitive for physical bits of metal to travel from buyer to seller). A good store of long-term value, but bad for short-term trading since the transaction costs are so high.\n\nFiat and other digital currencies are more portable, but have problems in the area of limitation of supply. Bad long term stores of value(I am not going to bequeath my great-grandchildren AA miles, WoW gold, or US dollars), but good for trading, especially trades within the same country.\n\nThe case Casares makes in the video is that Bitcoin can be better than both gold and other fiat/digital currencies. \n\nI agree.\n\nBetter than gold: More durable: math outlasts atoms. More scarce: Absolute knowledge of total supply that can *never* grow (caveat: Bitcoin participants could in theory agree to more supply, but the odds of this agreement happening are vanishingly small (on the order of lead radioactively transmuting to gold?). More transportable: digital transport costs vs physical transport costs.\n\nBetter than fiat/centralized-digital-ledgers: More scarce: Agreement of \nmost miners AND almost all wallet-holders to change rules of software vs Agreement of a few individuals. More durable: physical notes degrade, banks/businesses/governments can fail vs cheap cost of backing up wallet in multiple locations.\n\nIMHO, the case for Bitcoin being a better money than either fiat or gold is justified based on this reasoning.\n\nThe only challenges I see for Bitcoin in the future are in terms of transportability and fungibility.\n\nThe fee for making a bitcoin transaction is around USD $0.05. A blockchain with *similar total USD worth* that can beat that will beat Bitcoin.\n\nThe pseudonymity of transactions might make some bitcoins worth more than others. It\'s possible that a government might attempt to harass owners of certain coins based on their history. "Businesses within this legal jurisdiction found with tainted coins will be fined X amount". This hurts the fungibility of a currency. A currency without this drawback would have an advantage in proportion to the probability of this type of attack.\n\nI think both of these problems have technological solutions. For Bitoin\'s sake I hope it is technologically flexible enough to adopt them. It would be nice if Bitcoin became the one currency of humanity, but it is going to have to earn that title via further innovation.\n\nedit: typo': 5, 'Garbage men are creating value.': 2, "Wonderful explanation.
