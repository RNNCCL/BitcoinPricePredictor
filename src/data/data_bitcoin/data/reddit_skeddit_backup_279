Underclocking is a helluva drug': 2, 'good point': 1, 'cc: u/nullc -- Relates to mining & decentralization & incentives\n\nHey u/luke-jr, I finally found our conversation regarding bitcoin mining and botnets! What a chore.\n\nSo, I just came across Satoshi\'s post in regards to botnets, which I think is quite illustrative, and defends botnets as an unfortunate compromise:\n> "As long as honest nodes control the most CPU power on the network, they can generate the longest chain and outpace any attackers." -- from white paper abstract!\n\nRelate that \'first principles\' concept to this later statement by Satoshi, which is just unbelievably genius in its thought process and pulling together of disparate concepts (like the \'long tail theory\'):\n\n>>> As long as honest nodes control the most CPU power on the network, they can generate the longest chain and outpace any attackers.\n\n>>> Satoshi Nakamoto\n\n>> But they don\'t.  Bad guys routinely control zombie farms of 100,000 machines or more.  People I know who run a blacklist of spam sending zombies tell me they often see a million new zombies a day. This is the same reason that hashcash can\'t work on today\'s Internet -- the good guys have vastly less computational firepower than the bad guys.\n\n> Thanks for bringing up that point. I didn\'t really make that statement as strong as I could have.  **The requirement is that the good guys collectively have more CPU power than any single attacker.**\n\n> There would be many smaller zombie farms that are not big enough to overpower the network, and they could still make money by generating bitcoins.  The smaller farms are then the "honest nodes".  (**I need a better term than "honest"**)  The more smaller farms resort to generating bitcoins, the higher the bar gets to overpower the network, making larger farms also too small to overpower it so that they may as well generate bitcoins too.  **According to the "long tail" theory, the small, medium and merely large farms put together should add up to a lot more than the biggest zombie farm.**\n\n> **Even if a bad guy does overpower the network, it\'s not like he\'s instantly rich.**  All he can accomplish is to take back money he himself spent, like bouncing a check.  To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a merchant, wait till it ships, then overpower the network and try to take his money back.  **I don\'t think he could make as much money trying to pull a carding scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins.**  With a zombie farm that big, he could generate more bitcoins than everyone else combined.\n\n> **The Bitcoin network might actually reduce spam by diverting zombie farms to generating bitcoins instead.**\n\n> Satoshi Nakamoto\n\nhttps://www.mail-archive.com/cryptography@metzdowd.com/msg09967.html\n\nObviously, nothing is "ideal" about using botnets, but if there\'s no other option for a decentralized resistant network, then there is no other choice. We need to be pragmatic, as Satoshi is, and focus on what can work in the real world.\n\nThis is what I suspected too, as I\'d written to you before that botnets are not really "criminals", just interested in making profit, albeit unethically. Anyway, I think solutions need to be devised with the assumption that botnets are "OK". Ideas need to be reoriented to block actors malicious to the network, not judge actors based on their rationale for wanting to mine (since mining = securing the network). Bitcoin\'s genius is that anyone from anywhere can use it, regardless of their motivations or ideologies.

In that instance, your pre-fork coins are spendable on both sides.  That\'s where things will get messy.  You can\'t spend your pre-fork coins on just one side or the other without taking specific action and without that action your funds get spent on both sides -- to the benefi of the recipient of your spend transaction.  \n\nThink of it like how you might earn airline miles when you pay using your credit card, but because of the fork the person you paid gets the miles and not you.

Recent cyanide leaching techniques have made it possible again to profitability mind gold at formerly abandoned sites in the U.S. so that it is now a big producer.  However, the unpredictability of the cost is a negative factor.\n>(ii) The location of potential gold-mining locations may not be \xe2\x80\x9cpolitically appealing.\xe2\x80\x9d so it would seem undesirable to make a political choice to enhance the economic importance of those particular areas.\n>(iii) There is some negative psychology about gold such tat even if it were the most logical choice after all, the unpopularity of the idea could be very obstructive.\n\nBitcoin doesn\'t fail as hard for these reasons.  \n\nBitcoin as a scalable payment network doesn\'t fit the use because changing the scale to much such a thing creates and instability of cost of using bitcoin in relation to the available bitcoins.

After 20 years expire, anybody can replicate the formula and offer a generic version. Generics are always cheaper because the creator of the generic did not have to go through the R&D process and incur the same expenses as the patent holder.\n\nGeneric versions are just not allowed to use the same name as the brand who holds the current patent when the patent actually expires.\n\nFor example Viagra still holds their patent until the year 2017 which is why those little boner pills still costs so much, yet in a 2 year timeframe when the patent expires you are going to see a flood of generic versions of those little blue pills hit the marketplace.\n\nThe generic version will not be called the same thing, yet the ingredients, manufacturing process and end results will be the same as Viagra.

They likely have a contract with the same factory that was used by the previous owners. They acquired this drug last month, after their predecessor recently (2 months ago) changed the distribution model to sole-source, which is a detail no one\'s yet discussed when talking about the marketplace for the drug.\n\nLots of ignorance in previous comments up the chain. A generic equivalent could make it to market to compete with Turing\'s drug in the US, for a theoretical payoff, but no one will do it - Turing could drop the price back down or even discount it to dissuade investment by competitors. The market for this is extremely small in the US.

I will try to answer you as simple as possible.\n\n\nYour wallet keeps track of all your addresses. As you generate new addresses it keeps track of the old ones. So if someone sends Bitcoin to an address you generated previously, then that is fine. Or if they send to the address multiple times that is fine as well. The "balance" you see in your wallet app is showing the sum of all the addresses in your wallet. So your wallet may say you have 5 BTC but behind the scenes it is really 3 BTC on one address and 2 BTC on another. This is really what a wallet is doing, managing all your addresses for you.\n\n\nAs far as for donations. The simplest way is to just to publish one single address that everyone can see. But because everyone is using the same address, anyone can see every donation that has been sent to it. If you are ok with it, and many people are, then go for it. You could even change it manually from time to time if you would like.\n\n\nAs far as I know the only simple way to be able to give different addresses to different people would be to use a third party online "wallet" like Coinbase. They give the ability to add a nice button to your page that takes care of everything for you. They also have an Android app. ***The drawback here is that you don\'t control your Bitcoin directly until you withdraw it from Coinbase.*** At any time Coinbase, just like a bank, can decide to lock your account, they can get hacked, go out of business. This goes against the spirit of what Bitcoin is.\n\n\nNo matter what you do make sure you are familiar with how to backup and restore the wallet you are using. If your phone gets lost or destroyed you don\'t want to lose your Bitcoin as well.': 2, "This is all correct, and there are a couple of solutions currently in development. Stealth addresses are one such solution. ArcBit supports these stealth addresses, but most other consumer wallets don't yet. \n\nFor now, the best solution (avoiding address reuse) is to use a system such as mycelium gears to receive payment. Coinkite also has a good system as well. These systems require the use of an API to generate/track receive addresses, and thus require a developer to implement them. \n\nThat said, for now, I would just keep the same receive address and change it occasionally.
