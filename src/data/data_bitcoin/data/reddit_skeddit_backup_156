If we can accept SW (equiv. capacity increase of ~1.75-2x), then that is the limit as far as miner preferences in 2016. Adding a 2MB hard fork on top brings us to 3.5-4x increase in bandwidth, which is outside the realm of consensus for 2016 increase.\n\nDo you see this logic?\n\nSimply by this logic, the *optimal* solution is to diligently work on bringing "SW soft-fork" forward by April 2016:\n\n* Do the necessary work\n\n* It has already been tested as a sidechain in Elements, since July.

I\'m not trying to speak for the consensus at this time, just what my thinking is.\n\nHard forks should be extremely rarely done and only for very good reasons. My reason for the 2MB increase is not so much the increase as it would give an opportunity to learn more about hard fork mechanics and to teeter us on an edge that I think we could recover from (OH! We didn\'t think about [unknown unknown] consequence, we\'ll know better for next time). The not yet deployed versionbits developed out of the need to work out a way to deploy multiple soft forks simultaneously, and I think it\'s a great idea. It\'s because we now know a lot more on how to manage soft forks now that we gained that data through experience. Similarly we need to develop procedures for dealing with hard forks.\n\nThat said, I do think if we go overboard we will get into a situation where we can\'t get out of. Once centralized (in terms of nodes and mining), the ability to bust that centralization is extremely limited. It essentially requires a revolution in the form of a change in the POW algorithm (I can not think of any other way to "bust" it). Users need to be the economic majority in Bitcoin, rather than institutions for this very reason. Ideally mining would be more distributed than it currently is as well. The problem with relying on the nuclear revolution option is that revolutions always cause collateral damage. Additionally, in order to keep that option open, I believe that a median home computer with a median internet connection needs to be able to function as a node ("Burn the Satoshi defiler!!!").\n\nI keep putting off writing a very long post where I present these ideas more holistically, I just haven\'t had the time to put it together.

Next you can send multi-hop payments using more tricks. So as long as the network is connected to each other, and there is liquidity along some path, you can pay anyone cheaply, and fast.  \n\n': 5, "First you lock your funds in a bitcoin transaction that uses a smart contract to make sure that you can get your money back if the other party betrays you and makes sure to them that you can't spend your funds on the blockchain for that period.\n\nThis creates a trusted channel where you can now constantly send transactions that don't need to hit the network except before the refund tx runs out.\n\nSo let's say you wanted to pay someone by the minute. Every minute you would send them a new signed transaction that pays them more money. So first you send payment for minute 1, then minute 2, etc. They can just discard the minute 1 transaction.\n\nBasically between the two of you, you keep an ongoing record of your balance, and the record is actually a transaction. When you are done you can tell the channel to close and the person you are paying can actually submit that transaction to the blockchain. Now 300 minutes worth of payments are folded into one payment.

The problem is not that no one knows how to do routing, but rather that everyone has an opinion on how to do routing and it will be some time still before best practices emerge. Also, there's a lot of very cool tech being worked on that does things far beyond the original LN vision.\n\nFor example, onion routing allows payments to move through the network without anyone except the payer and payee knowing who was paid, in a way directly analogous to Tor. And like Tor hidden services, it is possible to send payments to a rendezvous address and have them forwarded on without even knowing the lightning node endpoint associated with the person you are paying!\n\nThere's a lot of cool tech being worked on and it just needs a little care and attention before going mainstream.\n\n> I like the idea of LN, but I think eventually big banks will step in and become middlemen, with only 2 hops from Alice to Dave, through them.\n\nPerhaps.

I\'m assuming this "ongoing record" is managed using a far easier approach than a blockchain technology.

': 3, "> Does LN automatically figure out if there is a path from Alice to Carol or is it upto Alice to first discover the path?\n\nThe wording is a bit ambiguous. It's up to Alice to find the path, but path discovery is part of what the LN protocol specification will address. When Alice comes online she syncs her state of the payment channel graph using lightning protocol messages, then uses that graph to find a minimal fee route.\n\n> When the network gets big, won't finding a path become increasingly slow, i.e. O(V+E)\n\nAs a worst-case estimation, sure. Note that these costs are only born by Alice, not the lightning network as a whole or even the nodes being routed through.\n\nIn a moonshot scenario where there are 7bn people using Bitcoin via LN, O(V+E) scaling could get annoying (not impossible for workstation-class hardware, but annoying). But there are pathways to make it work even in that scenario -- you could track the routes you care about and their immediate neighbors up to some local memory limit, and then pay a route-finding server for routes you can't figure out locally, when you need to.\n\n> What happens if Bob goes offline mid-way though my channel operation? Is the channel re-routed? What if there is no other route?\n\nThe payment fails/timeouts and Alice either finds another route or resorts to an on-chain transaction. The process of unwinding the transaction reveals the information needed for the other parties to unlock the funds which were going to be part of the payment.\n\n> Why isnt it more practical for Alice to simply open a channel with Carol instead of finding a route through multiple mid-nodes that need to be online all the time?\n\nDepends on the cost of an on-chain transaction vs lightning fees. It is entirely reasonable that lightning payments may be many orders of magnitude cheaper than an on-chain payment. But there are likely to be frequent cases where LN payments get expensive, either because the destination is not well connected or because intermediate channels are filling up. In this case it does make sense to open a channel directly, for approximately the same cost as an on-chain payment, then collect fees of transactions routed through that channel.

Those of us with going concerns that aren\xe2\x80\x99t engaged in crime or falling into ruin have to cope with the perceptions those grains create.\n\nReleased in 2009, Bitcoin is still very new, as far as network-centric applications go. The blockchain and the peer to peer connections used can be compared to other network applications like DNS, the domain name system, which was released in 1984, and which is still being refined and extended today. Immaturity in blockchain based currencies like Bitcoin is clear; the seven transactions per second and half hour verification times are issues that will have to be addressed as volume increases.\n\nThere have been spectacular, tragic failures in these first years as Bitcoin has spread, and these events, coupled with sometimes hasty journalism, have led to beliefs that are only loosely connected to reality.\n\nAutumn Radke, CEO of First Meta, died at age twenty eight after she jumped from the balcony of her 25th story apartment in Singapore. Echoing the manner of death of stock brokers and bank executives during the crash of 1929, reporters unfamiliar with the industry cut the name First Meta out of the narrative and dramatized Radke\xe2\x80\x99s tragic death the loss of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Bitcoin CEO\xe2\x80\x9d.\n\n\nMt. Gox was a site associated with Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game, where players traded cards in a manner similar to stocks. Like Ebay, which started as a site about the Ebola virus, Mt. Gox stumbled into a burgeoning need for Bitcoin related services. When the company collapsed in February of 2014, 850,000 Bitcoins worth $450 million had vanished. This was an eye catching number, but less than 10% of the total market capitalization at the time. The media again dramatized this event, billing it as the bankruptcy of all Bitcoin, rather than lucidly exploring the need for regulation and insured exchanges.\n\nThe biggest criminal case thus far involving Bitcoin was Silk Road, a darknet drug market whose owner, Ross Ulbricht, made $80 million on $1.2 billion in transactions over fifteen months. He is currently serving a life sentence for six attempts to hire hitmen to deal with problematic users of the market.

Firstly, increasing the block size now would create a dangerous precedent to keep doing so in the future. The only way for there to be a reason for fees to be paid is limited block size. If it has been increased it will be increased again (just think how you would react if someone wanted to increase the supply from 21M to 21.1M? Terrible right? Because of the precedent not the economic impact).\n\nSecondly, there is the economic impact. Fees are rising because the limit is being approach. If we increase the limit now it's centralized intervention which disrupts the entire equilibrium which is developing. I know it's very common in today's society to do centralized planning but it's extremely suboptimal and Bitcoin was a way to escape that. A true free market. Proponents of an increase of the block size are proposing to destroy that.\n\nThe largest differentiating quality of Bitcoin is a truly secure store of wealth (not a transaction system it sucks for that). So this feature must be optimized! An increase of the block size will decrease the eventual security. The eventual security will be a function of the total economic value of Bitcoin, the desired transaction force and the blocksize (capacity). A doubling of the block size will have a huge negative effect on the eventual security of Bitcoin.\n\nVisiting back that Bitcoin is not an efficient way to have a global transaction system used by everyone. It's terribly inefficient for that. You don't need a trillion dollar system to secure your $1 coffee purchase. You do need it for your $100M trust fund. Or to move $100M to another jurisdiction when your country collapses. (see also: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ys73h/jeff_garzik_universal_payments_is_both_a_laudable/)\n\nFinally there is centralization. Hash rate is only half the story when we talk about security. There are people with guns in this world who use violence to get what they want and we must protect against that. Also power corrupts. The only method we have to protect against both of these is decentralization. Bigger blocks increase centralization (less people will run full clients, only miners with huge scale can run economically etc.) and thus endanger Bitcoin as well.

I'm fine with people using it as such in the short term. I just don't want to change (weaken imo) the system to accommodate it\n\n2. Moving $100M is easy today if you hold $100M in Bitcoin and want to continue to hold that. You need to do nothing except get you and your private key out of the location you're in. Satoshi has probably done this already.\n\n3. It doesn't need to be the only. I just don't want to risk that use case at all, since that alone justifies a market cap orders of magnitude above today. Why be greedy? (let other cryptos develop for other use cases, I'll cheer them on)\n\n4. fees will not work from one day to the next. The continuous rising fees over time have made me value Bitcoin higher and higher because it makes it more likely a fee market will develop. So yes, fees do increase the value of Bitcoin according to my valuation technique which may differ from yours.\n\n5. Miners are each others competitors and miners of large size have different incentives than smaller ones. The incentives of the large ones are large at odds with Bitcoin as a whole (but these are currently nicely counterbalanced with the rigid set of rules). \n\nMiners will indeed reject 0 fee tx at some point. 1 Satoshi might be enough for acceptance however.\n\n6. Able to change itself when needed is important. Willing to compromise it's core values is not. In that respect I like to refer to the 21 M BTC limit.

In the long run this kind of usage will disappear or move to altcoins / lightning, but you don't have to force this now. Everything changes.\n\n- 100M trust fund: today it's a bad idea to move 100M with bitcoins. Volatillity, spread on exchanges and exchanges fees make this very very expensive. \n\n- move 100M when your country collapses: That's one of the best usecases bitcoin could serve. But why should it be the onliest?\n\n- miners / fees 1: fees are not needed now. Currently the best support for miners is to make bitcoin more valuable. Many people think that the higher the transaction capacity, the higher the value and so the higher the block reward. The correlation of number of transactions and value suppports this.\n\n- miners / fees 2: miner manage the risk of orphans against transactions. There is a natural fee market. Also they are free to not accept tx with no fees. The more transactions, the more fees.\n\n- precedent: If the blocksize is raised in consens, it would be a precedent that the system is able to change itself if needed. Increase of the supply is a red herring. It's no option to let the system stay the same forever. That's a design to loose.\n\n- store of wealth: Neither you nor me should want to decide what bitcoin is. Bitcoin is what people make with it. And it's a store of value cause people expect it is used as a payment system and it's actual use as a payment system support the demand for bitcoins. So if you want bitcoin to fail as a payment system you risk that it fails as a store of value.\n\n- centralization: yes, decentralization is extremely important for bitcoin and it has to be carefully thought, which blocksize is able to support this. I think it's higher than 1 MB.\n\n": 3, 'That\'s kind of a "big deal", no?': 2, "I don't get it. Wouldn't people who don't want change only care about Dum and people who want change care about Dee?

As often I wonder how people preferring very different methods can agree on the goals. That's tragic part of most conflicts.\n\nI agree with most of your points:\n\n- extending bitcoins usage as a payment-system for coffee should not set the system at risk.\n\n- moving 100M is easy, when you have bitcoins and hold them. It's not, when you don't (like currently 99.9 % of all people having / managing such funds)\n\n- I'm completely ok when bitcoins becomes digital gold and altcoins are used to buy coffee (that's no my vision, but my vision is not important)\n\nCan you go into details why bigger blogs hurt mining-decentralization? Because the orphans? \n\nSome points I don't agree:\n\n- In my view bitcoins usability as a payment systems is an important reason for bitcoins current usage as a store of value. If blocks reach their limit, bitcoins usability as a payment system will implode and with it its value. While to some later time bitcoin will be a store of value by itself (without payment usage), it's everything but clear that it will ever reach this state when we cut out the payment system now. \n\n- the blocksize-debate has nothing to do with the 21M cap. Nobody will accept that, and if a miner's cartell chooses to enforce it, it has nothing to do with some decisions made today about the blocksize. \n\n- bitcoin's ruleset is not that blocks are capped at 1MB. That was a instrument to defend DoS-attacks originally implemented as temporary.\n\n- I don't think 2 MB blocks now would hurt decentralization of nodes too much. If you look at the average upload-capacity of the world's regions and do some math you should assume, that there are enough people capable of running a node. With miner's centralization I ask you for more details. \n\nin short: increasing the blocksize is a limited method to scale bitcoin without risking the system at all. But nowaday the usage as a payment system is necessary for it's usage as a store of value and not scaling bitcoin will be a risk for both.

Now the limit is advocated not to prevent spam, but to encourage paying of fees, or to limit the number of transactions in a block.

Neither would have been supported by Satoshi.  \n\nSo IMHO the important thing is for the *max* block size to stay ahead of the *actual* block size.

So we might end up with 1000 nodes serving 10000000 clients, who run these expensive queries... This won't work.\n\nSo while electrum-server is bad for privacy, it's the only computationally-feasible solution.\n\nSo back to indexing nodes, it's already quite expensive to run that, you can't do that on a $5/mo VPS as you need more storage. If we get to 8 MB blocks many hobbyists will stop running them as it will get too expensive.\n\nSo we might end with handful of commercial companies (like Blockchain.info) providing blockchain indexing service to millions of users.

It may take until june or later to activate, but once it does then only 5% of the network will be running non-compatible software. \n\nIm not sure why this very basic concept is ignored when discussing hardforks.

Perhaps we should use a new term like "chain-settled" or "chain-dependent" to refer to transactions that depend on the blockchain, but are not contained directly in it, like sidechains and Lightning? And maybe "in-chain" to refer specifically to transactions that are contained byte-for-byte in the blockchain? I like "on-chain" best to refer to transactions that are byte-for-byte included in a block, but, you know, I\'m willing to compromise.\n\nI think of a Lightning transaction in which Bob buys a beer at the pub as off-chain, because the marginal size of that transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain is zero, and the marginal fees for the Bitcoin blockchain is also zero. The only part of the Lightning transactions that hit the Bitcoin blockchain are the buy-ins and the settlements. As those are coupled mostly to duration and not to the number of transactions processed, and only weakly coupled to the amount of bitcoin processed (insofar that movement is asymmetrical between parties), it turns the fees Bitcoin sees from Lightning into a subscription model instead of a pay-per-use model. Performing a single in-chain p2pkh transaction could cost as much as a month worth of Lightning subscription in that case. Either the subscription cost is high and strongly discourages in-chain p2pkh/p2sh transactions, or the subscription cost is low and chain-settled Lightning transactions are not contributing significantly to the total fee pool. In either case, chain-settled transactions do not pay a fee that is proportionate to how much they benefit from the blockchain, because the current model is to pay for the block space (which chain-settled transactions use nearly zero of) instead of the hashpower (which chain-settled transactions still make use of).\n\nWe both want to pay for mining with fees. If we are relying on the Lightning subscription fees being high enough to be significant, that crowds out simple in-chain transactions, which I don\'t like. An alternative is that we let capacity grow, and let Lightning be basically free, and make in-chain transactions be affordable and very numerous. I like that much better. I think a Bitcoin in which in-chain transactions are plentiful and cheap is inherently better than a Bitcoin in which in-chain transactions are expensive and scarce.\n\nBut how do we walk the fine line between "cheap" and "free"?\n\n> much fee pressure is from defaults in old non-fee-estimation aware clients and services that are overpaying\n\nYes, I\'ve noticed that too. The highest fees ever in real terms occurred when blocks were around 150 kB on average. Fees/kB then were about 6 times what they are now. They went down again shortly after bitcoin-qt 0.8.2 was released, bringing the default fee from 0.0005 to 0.0001. However, I reach a different strategic conclusion from that. I think this means that people just don\'t care about the fees at current levels. This is a good thing. If we encourage people to stick to reasonable default minimums, at least for the next few years, as a sort of good-citizenship thing, I think people would stick to default fees. I think this could be a more consistent and (actually) reliable method than a fee market driven by a hard blocksize limit.\n\n> Note sudden excess capacity can reduce total fees due to supply and demand\n\nYes, this is one of the dangers of the fee market with capped blocksize. Since supply is inflexible once the limit has been reached, you can get rapid fluctuations in price as free capacity gets exceeded Monday through Friday during business hours in Europe and the USA, etc. Nighttime transactions might be basically free, daytime transactions prohibitively expensive, even though both bloat the blockchain equally. Fluctuations in fees might cause a fee-panic similar to a bank run, where high fees make people think that the system is becoming unusable, which makes them want to sell, which shifts the exchange rate, which makes them want to sell.... Eventually, most people have fled to an altcoin, and blocks are no longer full, so fees drop to zero and miners go bankrupt... Also, if the fee market became lucrative to miners, it may be hard economically/politically to ever increase the blocksize again. \n\nI think that if we\'re going to be doing economic market shaping, using the blocksize as the tool is rather crude and inefficient. I think that really what we want to be doing is setting a price floor. Interestingly, that is pretty close to the effect of the default fee settings in miners and wallets. I think that if we institutionalize that, it can go a long way (maybe 4 to 8 years). My calculations show that it is entirely feasible to pay for mining with large-but-reasonable block sizes and low-but-nonzero fees. I think that we can get enough users and transactions that find $0.05 to $0.10/tx to be close enough to zero that it\'s not worth changing for most users. \n\nIf default fees end up not being sufficient, then perhaps we can look into system for setting up a collective bargaining system for miners to choose a minimum acceptable fee-per-kB, enforced by consensus. Yes, I know that such systems can never be perfectly enforced because of the potential for back-channel deals between users and miners, but we don\'t have to make it perfectly enforced. As long as fee-per-tx is small (on the order of a few cents each), the incentive for people to try to dodge fees should be small enough that we only need to make fee-dodging a little bit awkward and inconvenient, and possibly embarrassing. (E.g. you\'re paying your girlfriend back for the plate you broke while at her apartment, and in doing so you use a coinjoin transaction with F2Pool to avoid the mandatory minimum fee. She gets fed up with what a cheapskate you are and dumps you.)\n\nThe main thing I don\'t like about the collective bargaining approach is that it gives miners a way to choose a price that maximizes their revenue. While that sounds like a totally reasonable thing for a (decentralized) business to do, and would probably result in fees-per-kB that are acceptable to both miners and users (i.e. hits a reasonable point on the demand curve where volume is high but elastic vs price), I think it might give us miners too much revenue and will cost users too much. I\'d prefer for us miners to make enough money to pay for a reasonable amount of hashpower, rather than as much money as possible, because... well, I think we\'re already hashing with more electricity than the use-case requires.\n\nBy the way, sorry for not supporting 2-4-8 a few months ago.

Also the danger of centralisation is real, there is a serious propegation delay as it is..': 0, "Why not a SegWit soft fork instead of a blocksize increase hard fork? Here are my opinions. ([Cross post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3ygu5d/blocksize_consensus_census/cydpcob) from /r/btc)\n\n1. SegWit is a lot more complicated than a simple blocksize increase, and has been under discussion and investigation for a much shorter period of time. I am not comfortable with it being deployed on a time scale that I think a capacity increase should be deployed on. \n\n2. SegWit would require *all* bitcoin software (including SPV wallets) to be partially rewritten in order to have the same level of security they currently have, whereas a blocksize increase only requires full nodes to be updated (and with pretty minor changes).\n\n3. SegWit only increases the capacity for typical transaction loads (mostly P2PKH, some multisig) to a maximum effective size of 1.75 MB. Achieving this increase requires 100% of new transactions and wallets to use SegWit. With 50% adoption, the capacity increase may only be 37.5%. (Previous rollouts of new transaction formats have taken about 1 year for widespread adoption.) On the other hand, SegWit increases the capacity for blocks full of specially crafted multisig transactions to nearly 4 MB. This means that it eats up a lot of our safety headroom (e.g. for adversarial conditions) while only providing a very modest increase in typical capacity. This seems like it might actually be intentional, as it makes the types of transactions that will be needed for Lightning and Blockstream products like sidechains relatively cheaper, and will not benefit on-chain transactions much. The reduction in headroom will also make any subsequent blocksize increases harder to gain political support for, which also may be intentional. This concern can be addressed by limiting the total size of SegWit block+witness to around 1.75 MB.\n\n4. SegWit makes more technical sense as a hard fork. As a soft fork, it would be deployed by putting the merkle root of the witness data tree into the coinbase message or into an OP_RETURN transaction somewhere. The coinbase message field is already quite cramped with block height, extranonce1 and extranonce2, merged mining information, blocksize vote information, and other miner/pool-specific data, and I believe that the remaining space should be reserved for miner use, not for developer use. An OP_RETURN transaction sounds technically preferable, but still pretty crufty and nasty. Both options would have the result that all witness proofs would require including the merkle path to the transaction in question plus the transaction in question, and would increase the size of such proofs by about 50%. Putting the witness data in a sibling tree to the transaction data makes way more technical sense, makes the whole system easier to code for in all wallet and Bitcoin software that will ever be written, and reduces the size and complexity of verifying the witness proofs. However, doing so would require a hard fork, which is what the Core developers are trying so desperately to avoid. Doing SegWit initially as a soft fork then moving the SegWit merkle root later with a hard fork is an option, but that would permanently commit SegWit data to both places in different blocks in the blockchain, and consequently would require all Bitcoin software ever to be written to be able to read SegWit data in both locations in order to be able to complete initial block download.\n\n5. SegWit makes more security sense as a hard fork. With SegWit, all Bitcoin wallets would no longer be able to accurately verify new transactions, and all Bitcoin software would need to be updated to be able to verify the new transaction+witness data format. With a soft fork, old wallets will see all new transactions as being valid regardless of whether they are actually valid or not. Pieter Wuille (sipa) makes the case that this will not result in any actual dangers to most users because miners will be selfishly honest and will only create blocks that are valid under the new rules. With a hard fork, old nodes would still fully validate transactions according to the rules that they were written for, and would not see new transactions or would mark them as invalid. They would remain on a separate and fully validating blockchain that lacked economic and had nearly zero mining. I think it is preferable to indicate the consensus rules have changed by moving mining and economic activity off of the old rules rather than to write the new rules in such a way that old nodes are relying on their trust in miners instead of verifying the rules themselves. I think that with a soft fork, nodes and software will not get upgraded as fast because the old code will still be dangerously mostly compatible, whereas with a hard fork, people will notice that they're not getting new blocks and upgrade because that's the only way they can maintain functionality.\n\nNote that the FAQ linked to by OP addresses some of these objections.

The simplest change would be a hard fork to update that line to say, for example, 2,000,000 bytes (2MB).\n\n***Hard forks are anything but simple***:\n\n- **We don\xe2\x80\x99t have experience:** Miners, merchants, developers, and users have never deployed a hard fork, so techniques for safely deploying them have not been tested. This is unlike soft forks, whose deployments were initially managed by Nakamoto, where we gained experience from the complications in the [BIP16](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki) deployment, where we refined our technique in the [BIP34](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0034.mediawiki) deployment, and where we\xe2\x80\x99ve gained enough experience with BIPs [66](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0066.mediawiki) and [65](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki) to begin managing multiple soft forks with [BIP9](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0009.mediawiki) version bits in the future.\n\n- **Upgrades required:** Hard forks require all full nodes to upgrade or everyone who uses that node may lose money. This includes the node operator, if they use it to protect their wallet, as well as lightweight clients who get their data from the node.\n\n- **Other changes required:** Even a single-line change such as increasing the maximum block size has effects on other parts of the code, some of which are undesirable. For example, right now it\xe2\x80\x99s possible to construct a transaction that takes up almost 1MB of space and which takes 30 seconds or more to validate on a modern computer (blocks containing such transactions have been mined). In 2MB blocks, a 2MB transaction can be constructed that may take over 10 minutes to validate which opens up dangerous denial-of-service attack vectors. Other lines of code would need to be changed to prevent these problems.\n\nDespite these considerable complications, with sufficient precautions, none of them is fatal to a hard fork, and we do expect to make hard forks in the future. But with segregated witness (segwit) we have a soft fork, similar to other soft forks we\xe2\x80\x99ve performed and gained experience in deploying, that provides us with many benefits in addition to allowing more transactions to be added to the blockchain.\n\nSegwit does require more changes in higher level software stacks than a simple block size increase, but if we truly want to see bitcoin scale, far more invasive changes will be needed anyway, and segwit will gently encourage people to upgrade to more scalable models right away without forcing them to do so.\n\nDevelopers, miners, and the community have accrued significant experience deploying soft forks, and we believe segwit can be deployed at least as fast, and probably more securely, than a hard fork that increases the maximum block size.\n\n*Edit: adding proper emphasis for those missing the point of this post*': 4, '> hard forks are dangerous\n\nno they are not, this is the most boogie-man statement I have ever heard.

This requires lots of on-chain scale because most of the bitcoin exchange transactions are off-chain and are collectively much higher volume than bitcoin on-chain transactions.  I view lightning as on-chain because they are cached cut-through Bitcoin transactions and may actually increase on-chain fees because they increase scale a lot (a lot more cheap transactions can result in cheaper fees and more fees).  But either way we need more on-chain scale because Lightning itself uses on-chain space.  Note sudden excess capacity can reduce total fees due to supply and demand - why pay more than minimum if some miner will take minimum or zero with an eye to driving future value, fee-estimation will automate that effect even, much fee pressure is from defaults in old non-fee-estimation aware clients and services that are overpaying http://rusty.ozlabs.org/?p=564 Side-chains are more about opt-in extensibility than scale.  Side-chain elements also uses pegged Bitcoin as a fee currency which creates new fee opportunities for miners once merge-mining is added (most miners seemed pretty enthusiastic about merge-mining side-chains to provide security services to bitcoin 2.0 stuff).  \n\nBitcoin *is* tokenised security fees and all financial transactions need security - the main innovation of Bitcoin comes from automating trust and security.\n\nAnd yes the time-locked bitcoin (plus early adopter/miner or later investor status of many founders & employees).

Instead, the seller of the bitcoins takes \xe2\x80\x9cpossession\xe2\x80\x9d of the CNY that was used for the bitcoin purchase. The seller can withdraw the CNY from BTCC and do whatever they please with it. If the seller wants to exchange the CNY for foreign currency, he/she would still need to do that at a bank or bureau de change, which both enforce capital controls.

Also, they purposely locked the chip at 50GH to avoid dealing with people pushing it too hard and creating support issues/harming the UX. So theoretically it could be even better.\n\nI wonder how much each chip costs them.': 2}, ('Bitcoin Trader Admitted To Selling Drugs On Darknet Markets', 4): {'Well more people use USD to buy drugs than BTC.
