First, he said you can\'t pay your taxes with Bitcoin.  Well, no, there\'s no large gang of armed thugs demanding extortion payable exclusively in Bitcoin.  But so what? You can\'t pay taxes with gold.  To me, his comments there smack of the stupid "intrinsic value" argument that fails to understand that money is simply an accounting system for keeping track of value given but not yet received.  It doesn\'t need a non-monetary use in order to perform that function.  Second, he said that "Bitcoin isn\'t looking too good" / "has sort of collapsed," presumably a reference to its recent price decline.  That strikes me as kind of an absurd claim and seems to reflect ignorance of Bitcoin\'s past "bubbles" / hype cycles.  It was over a thousand bucks a Bitcoin a year and a half ago and now it\'s around 300 bucks. And sure that sounds like a huge decline until you remember that three years ago bitcoins were trading for around 5 bucks a piece and five years ago they were trading for less than a penny.  And third he claimed (or pretended) not to understand Bitcoin\'s value proposition, focusing simply on the fact that Bitcoin is "digital," e.g.: \n\n>"If I want a way to make payments electronically, that\'s, you know, credit cards."\n\n>"Exactly what is it that this thing is doing that we don\'t already mostly do, I mean, there are technical differences, but pretty wild."\n\n>"We have four trillion dollars now in monetary base and it consist of nothing but ones and zeros."\n\n>"I mean so, what you know, the idea that I\'ve got, uh oh, this brilliant new thing that\'s going to be digital, we are already there, you know, yeah."\n\nThat\'s asinine.  Of course, Bitcoin isn\'t revolutionary because it\'s digital. And he\'s right that the dollar is also (mostly) digital. But what makes [Bitcoin so revolutionary is the fact that it\'s the first form of money that is both digital AND decentralized, the first form of money that allows *trustless* value transfer and storage, the first form of money to combine the reliable scarcity of a commodity like gold with the transactional efficiency of a purely-digital medium.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/36wxdl/two_approaches_to_conceptualizing_bitcoins_core/) Of course, all of that was what he was glossing over with his snide: "There is a lot of libertarian ideology about it, so people were looking for something and they bought into it, literally bought into it for a while, but it has collapsed quite a ways."': 22, "I've seen a number of videos with Krugman.

This change comes by popular demand, since many clients have told us they would like to see a maker taker model with reduced fees overall. We have also simplified the fee structure with fewer tiers than before.\n\nWhat is a maker taker model?\nIn a maker taker model, reduced fees are given to the market \xe2\x80\x9cmakers\xe2\x80\x9d who provide liquidity to the market \xe2\x80\x9ctakers\xe2\x80\x9d. The maker fee applies when you add liquidity to the order book by placing a limit buy below market price or a limit sell above market price. The maker fee is paid only when such orders are taken by new incoming orders. The taker fee applies when you remove liquidity from the book by placing a market or limit order that executes immediately against a limit order already on the book. All advanced orders trigger either market or limit orders and the triggered market or limit order will be maker or taker as described above.\n\nWhat are the benefits?\nTraders adding liquidity to the book will benefit from the reduced maker fee. Since we have reduced the fees overall, most traders removing liquidity from the book will also benefit from reduced fees compared to our previous fee schedule. Although takers pay a little more than makers (only 0.10% more), this is generally offset by the deeper liquidity and tighter spreads found in the maker taker model.\n\nWhat are the new fees?\nFor the bitcoin-fiat pairs, the maker fee goes as low as 0% and up to 0.16% depending on the amount you trade. The taker fee goes as low as 0.10% and up to 0.26% depending on the amount you trade. To review the new fee structure, please check the following link to our site.\n\nReview the new trade fees\nOur crytpo-crypto pairs also have a new maker taker structure with reduced overall fees. Note that the fees for the dark pool have also changed but do not follow a maker taker model, since the maker taker model is only advantageous when you can view the order book.\n\nWhen will the new fees be active?\nStarting August 1, 2015.\n\nQuestions or feedback?\nIf you have any questions or feedback about the new fee structure, we would love to hear from you. Please contact us at support@kraken.com.\n\nThank you for choosing Kraken Bitcoin Exchange.\n\nThe Kraken Team': 8, 'This is actually good news!': 3, "That could be, but it's not certain.
