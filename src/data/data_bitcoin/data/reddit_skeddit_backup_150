So to argue it is not a bitcoin project is just plain silly and result of someone just not liking it because it lacks a few features that might be relevant to one.\n\nFor actually working with bitcoin one has to run a server (always on pc) aswell, to keep up with the blockchain. Ofcourse we outsourced that to specialized services in many cases.

You can also accept and use Bitcoin's many features on centralized platforms like Magento or Shopify or through Ebay with Paypal. If OB is a Bitcoin project, then so is Ebay, Shopify, and Magento. The only thing that makes people think OB has anything to do with Bitcoin is that they use it for advertising.\n\n* Merchant-IDs in the blockchain are pointless. So what? There is no counterparty risk in merchant IDs. And that could be as simple as making a merchant-ID a public address. This is not a OB innovation, it is a Bitcoin innovation.\n\n* Using proof of burn to gain trust... this isn't in any way relevant. It's a protocol, and this is a proposed economic system endemic to the protocol. The notion that those with the most to gain (scammers) but who need the platform least, would not be willing to burn, but those with the least to gain but who need the platform most (small, new businesses who are trying to see if there is a market for their product) would be willing to burn to create profiles, is absurd. The idea here is to prevent sybil attacks. But calling something Spam is a judgment that shouldn't be made at the protocol level. That is why http doesn't ban spam, but Google and webrings let people sort around and through it.\n\n* Decentralized p2p rating system is a cute idea. I have read Dr. Washo's proposal numerous times, and I think it's a lot of words, nothign interesting, and almost nothing peer to peer about it. Also, this rating system has nothing to do with Bitcoin.\n\n> For actually working with bitcoin one has to run a server (always on pc) aswell, to keep up with the blockchain.\n\nThis isn't true at all. Other people run full nodes, you do not have to. Even still, this is not the equivalent of running an OB store. A full node is a copy of everyone's accounts on the B/C. An OB node is not, it is just your store, and a way to connect and route to peers so you can find stuff. If your bitcoin node goes down, the network isn't even slightly damaged. If your OB node goes down, your entire store goes with it.\n\nAs to why OB won't work? It provides absolutely 0 efficiency over the current system. It doesn't work over http, it uses UDP. So you can't link to products or benefit from Google crawling your store without a huge amount of rigmarole. A person has to have the alternative OB client installed on their machine to make it work. In the way that children had to host their html experiments on their home network in the early 90s, you will have to host your own OB store on your home computer. If your traffic is too much for your local service to handle, you will have to put it on a third party platform. So while OB developers like to claim that the network isn't censorable, they are not saying who it is censorable from. Right now, they're claim is that etsy, ebay, amazon, and the like can kick you off their platform. That's all well and good, but then you can go and start your own website if you would like. The cost to move from their platform to your own is virtually 0. Bitcoin works because it is censorship resistant from governments. It wouldn't be considered censorship resistant if the censorship resistance was limited to Ebay. It also wouldn't be interesting. You would be laughing at Bitcoin if it were claiming it's censorship resistant to Ebay and that's why it's cool. That's what OB is claiming, because they know there is no governmental censorship resistance. Whether you advocate full censorship resistance or not, the reason Bitcoin or Tor or the internet itself are so interesting is because they are permission-less, not because they are standing up to the great, evil powers of Ebay or Amazon. The tech only works if it's censorship resistant to everyone.": 3, 'I think most mobile wallets focus on making Bitcoin as easy to use as possible.

Because you refuse my answer "OB" as this is not a bitcoin project. Both of our views might have their reasoning, but I must ask you: What makes a project to be a "bitcoin project" in your eyes?

DNMs surely do their part, even if I think they are not the main driver behind bitcoin. And I believed at least (and still have some hope left) that OB will do another good part of this.\n': 1, 'That sounds productive! ': 0, 'Look, if you knew the answer to the question, you could be a billionaire. No one could have foreseen Google in 1992. We had webrings, and they were damn good - very effective at getting you to your content. Your question is begging, however. Your presumption is that Bitcoin needs or will be adopted en masse. The incentive for Bitcoin speculators is to pump, and want more users in the way that an MLM schemer wants more people to get in. But the Universe doesn\'t owe you that.\n\nYou should sit down, strap in, and just kind of let this ride happen.\n\nIn my not so humble, and always correct opinion, Bitcoin\'s core user group is the under-serviced: prostitutes without bank accounts, porn stars, drug dealers, people who need it for capital flight in countries where their currencies are being devalued by their governments (people can run miners in these countries to convert their money into energy which will give them Bitcoin at, what is probably, a slight loss that they consider to be less than the risk of holding their own fiat). Think of Bitcoin sort of like you might think of protein receptor. It works when it fits.\n\nI think that this community has a tendency to jimmy it in to every nook and cranny. Bitpay is AMEX, but with the Bitcoin (it processes tiny numbers of transactions and is basically used to buy gift cards, which is why investors aren\'t getting their money back); Coinbase is a bank, but with the Bitcoin (this is why coinbase\'s users are likely almost exclusively speculators and not users - it will suffer if speculators quit, which is a hard bet); Rebit.ph is remittance but with the Bitcoin (it is as efficient or less efficient than Western Union); and OB will be Ebay but with the Bitcoin (you can apply your own intellectual considerations if you want to speculate on where that will go).\n\nThey do not have a permissionless marketplace, they have a marketplace that mimics the internet. So if you want me to equivocate on "who is making the android to bitcoin\'s linux," I would venture to guess that it is a company you have never heard of who will enter the ecosystem in 20 to 30 years time and do something more unexpected than you could have ever imagined, but it won\'t be OB. Asking that question right now is like asking who will make the Google of the internet in 1992 when the internet was nothing but porn, email didn\'t really exist in the way it exists now (you had Eudora and weird shit like that).\n\nScaling the internet was a ridiculous task. I remember in the early days, AOL melted down, and users left in droves because it couldn\'t handle the traffic and started to slow way way down. This is why when people talk about Bitcoin scaling, it\'s very clear to me that they do not remember the early days of scaling the web. It didn\'t happen overnight, it was incremental, and as it grew organically, so too, did the solutions for scaling. You need to service your existing users before you can start asking where this will go. And that is why the core devs are working so hard to keep Bitcoin decentralized at the expense (people here think) of obtaining new users.\n\nMost users aren\'t users, they are speculators. Building Bitcoin for speculators at the expense of maintaining its only real, differentiating feature (uncensorable-ness) would be like saying that Linux is too hard to use, so in order to grow it, you need to make it look and act exactly like windows (including running windows programs). Good luck! Linux, by the way, didn\'t need a million people adopting it for it to be useful, it needed the right people to adopt it.\n\nAlso, it\'s worth noting, much of the speculation about Bitcoin is a bit absurd. No one ever said, "boy who will bring C++ to the masses?" Bitcoin, is a protocol. It\'s unsexy, it\'s not exciting, and I would be willing to bet that you will see an ecosystem of decentralized projects built on it that leverage it\'s only real, differentiating feature (uncensorable-ness). The tragedy of these projects is that they are altruistic. Unlike projects like Factom, Synereo, GetGems, Augur, or Dash\'s redirection of miner funds to developers all leverage tokens for the purpose of enriching the programmers who wrote them. While I understand the motivation for that sort of profit taking, that has never been the proposition that will work here.\n\nBitcoin was, is, and must always remain egalitarian. By the way, the tragedy of the commons that grows out of that egalitarianism might be its death. Satoshi mined because it was the only way to get it off the ground. The coins became valuable because people saw value in them. He built the protocol thanklessly. If it didn\'t work, his work was down the drain. The counterparty project did the same thing, to a large extent. The Drop Zone project (which is an actual decentralized market and a Bitcoin project because it\'s built on top of Bitcoin in its entirety) did the same thing.\n\nSo I guess the short answer to your question is that when someone builds an app that everyone finds useful, and everyone needs, and requires Bitcoin for everyone to use, that is when everyone will use Bitcoin. I wouldn\'t get your hopes up on that happening any time soon, and I wouldn\'t even go so far as to guarantee it will ever happen. But that is what Bitcoin will need if it\'s going to be adopted by the plebs.\n\nFor now, you can be satisfied that Libertarians will use it to buy bedsheets on Overstock out of principle. But in the spirit of the Holidays, I think the better thing to do, is simply be thankful that it is working, and if it doesn\'t work for anyone other than the people it is working for now, you can be proud of the fact that this community, you, me, and everyone here, have given those with no access to traditional markets or the money used therein the chance to participate and be treated with the dignity they deserve. That\'s about as far as I\'ll go about my motivations for being here.\n\nBut I would encourage you to examine your motivations if your goal is to bring Bitcoin to the masses without real consideration for what it might do to those that need it most. Because there is a strong chance that, in the short term, "bringing Bitcoin to the masses" will kill Bitcoin in the long term. Where, building Bitcoin for the use case(s) we know about and letting people come if it fits their Bitcoin shaped hole, is going to keep Bitcoin alive and useful.

Using TOR helps to not link an IP address to the set of bitcoin addresses but the bitcoin address linking is a huge and mostly overlooked issue.\n\nThis address linking can be prevented by either downloading one address at a time (users expecting to see incoming transactions on all their hundreds of addresses all the time will not like that) or by downloading significantly more addresses. How significantly? Well, best you download all addresses because if you are interested in one chain of change addresses but else, only in unconnected addresses, this chain will be the top candidate of "your addresses". Your filter better catches all addresses, including future addresses of other people\'s change chains. That is bad, so anything short of downloading almost all transactions can\'t protect you from snoopy SPV nodes.\n\nAlternatively you totally prevent address reuse and only query one address at a time and store the result, so you never have to query it again. Doing this, over TOR gets close to full node privacy. Or you trust some node to not store the relationship between addresses, which is what you have to do if you use Mycelium.': 1, 'Fantastic job, well done!
