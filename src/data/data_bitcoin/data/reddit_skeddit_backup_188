Welcome to 1993. Soon people will purchase everything they need online. We call it the world wide Web.\n\nSince you are too stupid to grasp the implication, I'll lay it out.  There's no single centralized server that acts as a single point of failure for the system.  Allow me to elaborate and see if you can manage to follow, complicated though it may seem to you.\n\nThe reason generally speaking websites are censorable is that they are owned by known companies who have known people running them who can be coerced.  Additionally, they often operate on only a few servers, which are easy to locate, or use domain names which are easy to redirect.  So the people can be coerced, and all the servers can be found and shut down, and the DNS names can be redirected.\n\nOpen Bazaar is different in many ways.  Firstly, although the people running it are known, the code is open sourced and copied on many *many* different computers.  I for example have a complete copy of the source code *and its version history and changes* on my computer.  As do many others.  If the people running it are coerced or stopped, the code and the project will continue.  Secondly, each person runs their store on their own computer.  While individually some people may have their servers raided or shutdown, it's impossible to raid everybody, and the majority of the stores will continue to operate, and many of those that are shut down will be able to migrate to other servers.  Third, many of the stores on OB may be run by individuals who wish to remain mostly anonymous, and so they will be run on servers that are either behind something like Tor hidden services, or they will simply be mirrors or redirects to other servers, so the owner will be able to get advanced warning of, if not outright block, attempts to identify or seize a server.  Fourth, OB uses Bitcoin and multisignature escrow as the payment system, so while traditional stores that get raided or shutdown get their funds confiscated and are thus permanently crippled, that cannot happen when an OB server gets shutdown or its owner strong-armed or arrested.\n\nDo you understand yet why you are wrong?": 1, "Yes it is.

So... if they are running their own store on their own computer, then isn't that a little like running your own website on your computer? Wait a second, what happens if your store gets used a lot? Where will you host it? Because I think that a lot of people accessing your store would gum it up... I guess if I were going to have a well-used store, I'd put it on an instance of Amazon. But that seems like it's getting to close to looking like a website now... I guess I'd just buy a faster computer and I'd pay like an extra couple thousand bucks to purchase like a huge amount of bandwidth into my home. Hope no one DOSes me since the data line probably is too small for someone to even try to distribute it. But I'm sure you have thought of fixes to that since I'm the idiot.\n\n> While individually some people may have their servers raided or shutdown, it's impossible to raid everybody, and the majority of the stores will continue to operate\n\nOk, this is interesting. I was under the impression that the entirety of OB would be shut down if even one store was raided. I guess that's not true. So, OB operates almost exactly like the internet right? Like if I'm selling pills from Canada in my store, and the police raid my home to shut down my website, the whole internet doesn't go down, just my site. Do I have that right? So, not to be too prideful, I'm not certain, so you'll have to clarify, but if someone raids a node operator, is the information in the Bitcoin network affected? Or does all the information stay on all the nodes? Because what you just described feels a lot like the internet and a lot less like a decentralized system. But I wouldn't know. I'm retarded. Please explain.\n\n> Third, many of the stores on OB may be run by individuals who wish to remain mostly anonymous, and so they will be run on servers that are either behind something like Tor hidden services\n\nThis is a good point. So, I get the sense that you're under the impression that this works with Tor. that would be pretty neat if it did. But since it's written on UDP, I believe it doesn't. But I'm the idiot, so you should probably double check for me. https://twitter.com/drwasho/status/650058499263590400, let me make it easy for you to double check.\n\n> they will simply be mirrors or redirects to other servers\n\nInteresting. Too bad the system nakedly broadcasts your IP... at least that's what I've heard.\n\n> OB uses Bitcoin and multisignature escrow as the payment system, so while traditional stores that get raided or shutdown get their funds confiscated and are thus permanently crippled, that cannot happen when an OB server gets shutdown or its owner strong-armed or arrested.\n\nWhew, I thought it was using something like VISA that a lot of people use.

However, I do think it is a mistake to assume good faith from all participants. Altcoins in particular will benefit from Bitcoin having smaller blocks for two reasons.\n\n\nThe first reason is smaller blocks means fewer transactions, means higher transaction fees, means more transactions for altcoins. The second reason is that if it impossible to change Bitcoin in any meaningful way, then new ideas can only be implemented in altcoins.\n\n\nSo if I were holding a large position in an altcoin, self-interest might incline me to argue for smaller blocks, and not necessarily for the good of Bitcoin. So evaluate not just the arguments, but where they are coming from too. Conflicts of interest abound.\n": 21, "Conflicts of interest are possible, there is no one denying that.  \nHowever, that doesn't mean that everything should be looked at in that context, for that's not at all productive.   \nIf there are concerns, those concerns should be addressed, whether they come from an honest view or a view with ulterior motives.": 5, "Good question, don't see why you're being down-voted.\n\nNumber of nodes somewhat correlates with the number of merchants full-node validating. The primary use-case of of full nodes (other than mining) is reducing risk when accepting payment, so more merchants running them is a good thing. Full nodes prevent miners from (assisting in) faking payments with invalid transactions. A merchant accepting payments using a full nodes is beneficial to not just them, but the whole network because the total reward paid to a miner for defrauding users decreases. So, while the number of full nodes can be an indicator for the likelihood of a merchant running a full node, it isn't a perfect measure, it is easy to manipulate through sybil attacks, and in general doesn't really measure any important aspects of decentralization (as long as there are a sufficient number of nodes).\n\nNumber of miners isn't a measure at all. A brief example: Currency A has 100 miners, all with 1% of the hashrate. Currency B has 1,000 miners, but one miner has 80% of the hashrate. Currency A is quite decentralized, but it has 1/10th the miners Currency B has, and Currency B is very centralized.\n\nNow, for your actual question:\n\nDecentralization, in terms of Bitcoin means that no group has control over the currency, and no group can change attributes of it you don't agree to. Any changes require the decentralized network to decide to change, the authorities don't have the power to do that.\n\nSo let's examine Bitcoins centralization:\n\nConsensus code, the code that determines which blockchain is correct, and which transactions are valid, has been mostly protected throughout Bitcoins history. Backwards-incompatible changes have been avoided at all costs since v0.3 (or arguably v0.1). v0.3 clients should agree with you on which blockchain is the tallest valid blockchain, and which transactions are valid, assuming a supermajority of honest miners. The consensus code is changed in a backwards compatible way in order to make updates. There have been cases where the consensus was broken, such as the 0.8 fork, however to preserve the decentralization ethos a softfork was performed which allowed old versions to once again be in agreement on transaction validity.\n\nIn terms of consensus code decentralization, I believe the weak point here is that many people simply download from bitcoin.org without validating the binaries.\n\nI am of the opinion that the main centralization threat, particularly with regards to large blocks, is miner centralization. Even if you are fully-validating, large miners can play tricks, including reversing transactions with some probability of success approaching 100% as their size approaches 50%. I won't explain why large blocks can create miner centralization here, but if you're interested [I wrote about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3hyj7e/august_22_2015_block_size_and_hard_fork_dialog/cubu3pr).": -5, "As with anything on the internet, there's always frustrated people around that need their opinion to be right to feed their ego. \n\nLosing an argument or having to change an opinion, feels like a huge defeat for these people.": 2, 'While I do enjoy your flavour of realism, I think you would benefit from explaining your understanding of the problem rather than naming people you believe are causing the problem.': -2, "I don't assume good faith first because some camps want to move away from educating the community and instead select a single person whose ideas they can adopt and blindly follow.\n\nI don't support people mentally dropping out of a project like Bitcoin and mobilizing behind an individual point of failure because that is the only way 'the bad guys' - anyone who would want to hurt Bitcoin - can actually do it.\n\nMaybe I over-estimate their potential effect.": 2, "I'm also of the general opinion that the vast majority of people on both sides of the blocksize debate are trying to act in the best interests of Bitcoin.

Companies/clubs/groups/anyone with memebers doesn't need to store any information to verify their users, just the code on the barcode.

So I apologize if the wording caused confusion, but you should know the context. This project was constructed for a competition and judged by technical judges in the decentralized industry, so all of our current information is with that in mind. We were referring to the **potential** in the video, as that is what our intended audience was interested in.\n\nBefore this reddit post, that was our only audience. I am glad you are here though, and let me answer your questions. First, our company isn't as active in the process as you may think. We as Cryptid can only issue IDs, meaning that once we give you our software (which is open source and you can download it today if you want), you can verify any ID that we have made or will make in the future. So any ID you made is permanent, but we have constructed methods to allow for changes, but all the originals are still accessible. \n\nTo answer your questions:\n\n1) If we fold, no new IDs can be issued unless we give our private key to a new issuer, which would be the case if we had customers. \n\n2) No IDs will be lost if we cease to exist. No changes need to be made, all existing IDs will continue to exist as we store no information, and all these IDs can still be verified.\n\n3) Another company can easily take over, all we need to do is give our private key to someone else.\n\n4) The software currently available is all the software we have to issue and verify IDs. Meaning customers do not need us to verify, and the software is already out there to take over.\n\nI hope that helps answer your questions, and the price point of 5 cents is for issuing an ID. The QR can be stored on anything, but what it is stored on may cost additional (like the physical plastic piece).\n\nPlease feel free to ask any other questions, I'd gladly help explain anything further": 1, 'I watched the video several times and have no idea how this works or what he\'s even doing.

What is the backup plan for us?  Will all our ids be lost?  Can another company easily take over for you guys to manage it?  Can we be given software to manage it ourselves if you fold?\n\nIf you can have plans for those questions and it's only 5 cents with built in backup then you'll make a shit ton of money.  I don't need to know how it works.  Don't tell folks though that it can consolidate all their current ids if it can't.

All we do is sign, otherwise anyone could make an ID, which would make fakes possible. Now back to the blockchain. The QR code points to the location of a cluster of entries, which our software, or a software you build can use our public key to verify which are legit and which are not.

However if you give the store front access to RPC and the store front is hacked then it could do anything it wants with the online wallet.  It seems like it would be useful if there were a way, either within bitcoin core or using an intermediate gateway to restrict the set of allowed RPC commands, based on IP address or a user based privilege system.': 1, "I've used similar code in production.

You should never store much money at all on a live server. If users only ever pay to your site, and can\'t withdraw, you should either automatically & frequently sweep the live wallet to some cold-storage wallet or else generate the addresses ahead of time and use bitcoind\'s watch-only address feature.\n\nIf users can also withdraw, then making it secure becomes a lot more complicated. You should avoid this if at all possible. Maybe only do withdrawals manually. Under no circumstances should you allow large amounts of user money to accumulate on a live server. Nor should you allow the live server to order a "cold-storage" computer to blindly send bitcoins to the live server or elsewhere.

If it\'s on a local machine or a trusted LAN, that\'s fine. If you want to have your bitcoind located across the Internet, ssh port forwarding would be a good option. Using bitcoind\'s built-in rpcssl feature isn\'t recommended.\n\nAs for the usage of PHP itself: Many big Bitcoin sites were/are written in PHP, and *some* of them remained secure. You can write secure code in PHP, though it\'s probably more difficult than in other languages. The trickier problems will be issues that are independent of language. For example, one big issue that you need to worry about is atomicity: if you want to both subtract a user\'s balance in a database and send some bitcoins on their behalf, you must ensure that either both of these things happen or neither of them happen, even in the face of a server crash or a user aborting the PHP script. If you\'re not already very familiar with this stuff, then whatever you write is *going* to be vulnerable to some attack like this, so you\'ll just have to set things up so that it doesn\'t damage you too much when someone figures out how to trick your site into doing something stupid.\n\nIt\'s very simple to use bitcoind\'s JSON-RPC via PHP.

What is the settling time in a remittance operation? 1 minute? 5 minutes? 10 seconds??\n\nI think it is a huge fallacy to compare amounts of USD PER YEAR units with total USD amounts, as many people do. Always remember that "1 year" is completely arbitrary, and for example for remittances it would be more suitable to use the settling time of a remittance deal, which is closer to a minute than to a year.\n\nSo what is global remittance volume per minute? 600 billion USD / 365/24/60 = 1.1 Million USD.

The USD value of that fee fluctuates exactly with the BTC price. Using your fair value, twice the price would always generate twice the fees.\n\nRecently, as the transaction rate approached the in-built transaction rate limit, wallets have begun adjusting fees to the emerging fee market, which might make future fee data more indicative of network value.\n\nYour method would appear to suggest you should be able to value USD by dividing all the USD in existence by all of the fees paid to move it around. With USD that would clearly be impossible, but I don\'t believe for second that you would suggest the amount of income Brinks, Western Union, MoneyGram, Visa, MasterCard ad nauseum would have an arithmetic relationship to the value of USD!\n\nI\'m a bit shocked that you didn\'t discuss miner rewards which should certainly be included in network fees when valuing the network, and circulation inflation which affects scarcity.\n\nNext there\'s the problem of fees -vs- value transfered which you touched on. The idea that "the network" operates in a fixed fashion is understandable given that many explanations were written when there was a uniform software implementation -- Bitcoin Core. While this aids in understanding, Bitcoin is far more complex today.\n\nLarge miners and mining pools no longer use the default rule set to choose transaction order, so the idea that large transactions get priority is no longer a truism. It\'s surely true that transferring a lot of value is more valuable than transferring a small value, yet your "analysis" doesn\'t take that into account.\n\nAt the end of the day Bitcoin, like all currencies, will be priced based upon it\'s utility -- much of which may -- like gold -- exist as a store of value. Bitcoin has more predictable scarcity, is cheaper to store securely, is more transactable, is easier to "transport", is harder to counterfeit, and is nearly as durable as gold.': 3}, ('Building Bitcoin Fullnodes LIVE - Support ProTip open source bitcoin tipping - join us', 1): {}, ('Missing Coins from Bitcoinqt?
