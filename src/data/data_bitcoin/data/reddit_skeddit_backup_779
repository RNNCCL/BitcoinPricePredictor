This means that some people will use this coupon and then pay with paypal or credit card. So, everywhere our website mentions the coupon, we explicitly state that it is only allowed to be used with bitcoin, and that using it incorrectly (i.e. with paypal) will result in your order being cancelled and refunded.\n\nThere have been some orders that use it incorrectly, I cancel them, and send the customer an email explaining that bitcoin is the cheapest and most secure payment method in our shop, so we pass the savings along to our customers. I also mention that if they re-place the order properly we'll have it shipped out asap for them. \n\nThis seems like it might piss customers off, but so far everyone has re-placed their order when this happens, so it hasn't led to any lost business.\n\nHope that helps!": 5, "Thanks!

I'm going to blow this out of proportion and use all caps to show you how important I am. ) \n\n> Dear robocoin Operator.\n> Like me you paid alot of money for Robocoin machine and it is YOURS.\n\n( I'm going to state the obvious and make you paranoid that someone is going to take your toys away. FUD. ) \n\n> Today Jordan Kelly CEO of robocoin is threatening us\n\n( A few months ago an update to the software was announced. It was announced again. Then when it was released an open call to convert was had. After a month or so a deadline was set. When the deadline arrived a final notice went out. How dare they threaten me like that!? ) \n\n all saying he will convert our machine into a login terminal for Jordans own centralised. proprietary, closed source, web based system. This benefits him and his company as it steals YOUR CUSTOMERS and gives him more centralised power.\n\n( All of the complaining customers did about how horrible the system was resulted in changes to improve the things that needed help. The new system works similar to the old system , you can still set your buy and sell vig. but you don't have to wait for transactions to clear exchanges or suffer when network connections fail or exchanges go down. So you still make money, the customers get a faster and better experience, and many of the problems I complained about have been fixed. I don't like this.  ) \n\n\n> This is not in the spirit of bitcoin's decentralised freedom loving roots. We as robocoin operators need to unite together and install open source software on our machines and cut Jordan out and his fees out.\n\n( I won't mention the fees I charge, because that would tarnish my freedom loving roots. The spirit of me making money is the one true freedom I cherish and I don't like having to comply with laws. So what if robocoin decided to give in and comply. I don't want to so they can't because I say so and robocoin has to do what I want them to do or I'll hold my breath until I turn blue on reddit )\n\n> I have spoken with who run free open source software on their machines. https://github.com/Lamassu/\n> It is possible to buy a separate PC that you can run alongside the PC that comes in the safe.\n> You can then just reconnect the webcam and validator to this new PC and run the machine as a giant Lamassu.\n\n( I took the advice Jordan gave me in the email that he sent after I refused to convert to the new software. He said that if I don't want to comply I could go talk to Lamassu, and gave me a link and an email to them. How dare he! ) \n\n\n\n> This software may need tweaking to get it working with the cash acceptor that comes in the robocoin. Cash Acceptor MEI 252704022P1\n> Here's the robocoin manual: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BxGOMhsnKhZxekp6eEFKOUdTLVk/view?usp=sharing\n> This is a call for help to the open source and bitcoin community to come together and make these bitcoin ATMs what they should be. Free and open.\n\n( I am technically inept and can't do any of this myself so I need someone to do it for me like I needed robocoin to do everything for me. If it doesn't work the way I want it to, I'll make another reddit cry and I will keep doing that until someone makes it work for me because I don't know an IP address from a zip code. ) \n\n\n> I will be turning off my 4 robocoin machines until either Jordan backs down on this and commits to supporting version 1 software as he said he would or we have the machines mnning on the lammgssu software.\n\n( I was told that if I did not allow robocoin to convert my systems to the new software, they would invoke the clause in the contract I signed that states that they can terminate my service if I don't upgrade to their new software. Then on the night of the deadline they terminated my service! Well I'm going to turn my machines off in protest! That will show them! \nThere's another clause that says they own the software and can update it at any time, without warning but they gave me months of notice instead! How dare they! How dare they expect me to honor a contract I signed! I want a do-over! Lots of companies decide to support their end of life software forever for free! Why can't robocoin? )\n\n> I suggest we all turn off our machines together to show we won't be bullied into his new system.\n\n( I am going to try to bully them into reviving end of life software and accuse them of bullying people to make them look bad. I'm clever! I bet lots of people will turn off their machines and stop making money to support me. I can be the next Che` and get my face on a t-shirt! ) \n\n> Please show your support for this project either by replying or adding your voice to the reddit post where I have posted this letter.\n\n( Please talk about this on reddit so I can look important and cutting edge, and perhaps even fuel the fire that people with legitimate complaints had and ride on their bandwagon. I can be one of the cool kids! ) \n\n> Regards\n> @jonnybitcoin\n\n( I am so full of shit I cry brown tears ) \n\n": 4, "Please finish that wallet of yours before pointing fingers at others'.

VM is limiting by cycle here, and since no real implementation of a Turing machine can support infinite execution, I don't see a problem. If you can assume infinite energy for the physical computer, you can also hypothesize based on infinite fees for the Ethereum VM.\n\nIt wouldn't be Turing complete if the programming language itself somehow limited computation.\n\nI agree with you in that I don't currently see in what way it will be helpful, since you are likely to depend on outside data anyway. But it may add some flexibility. As you said, there is no harm in trying.\n\nI think the topic that deserves an extended discussion is how these projects can proper funding. If we ignore the dispute about how good an idea Ethereum is, it is still apparent that they wouldn't be able to get enough funding without the greed angle, or some corporate backing, both of which this community dislikes, but doesn't propose a solution.\n": 2, '> Being "turing complete" (and ethereum is not!)\n\nCan you expand on what you mean by that?\n\nI really didn\'t dig deep into Ethereum, but it looks like they are working on a Turing-complete virtual machine.

Bitcoin was almost becoming Turing complete a few years ago, and fortunately it didn\'t. Someone else ought to do it and see whether it is the best approach. Maybe it will have too much overhead, too open to abuse or maybe just not that useful. Or it might be alright.\n\nRegarding the "scam" criticism, I guess it depends on how you look at it.\n\nIf the code isn\'t developed to a satisfactory degree, you might want to call it a scam. There is no indication that this will be the case, but I\'m sure there will be many shitstorms about this, since a project of this magnitude can\'t be pulled off without delays.\n\nHowever, I wouldn\'t call it a "scam" if investors don\'t get returns. I actually sent them some money, but see it as a donation (and it would be good to have a few to test the system). The code is very likely to be used for sidechains if they ever become a thing.\n\nOn the other hand, comparing the money they raised with other similarly useful projects like DarkWallet and experiments like OpenBazaar, the "investment" aspect seems to have worked a bit *too* well. That\'s why you get these strong reactions. I personally reciprocated by donating those projects a lot more.\n\nAll in all, one probably shouldn\'t recommend people to invest money in it (not that it is possible right now), but the tech will certainly be useful.\n': 4, "> I think really that Ethereum has solved this problem once and for all.\n\nThere is still the problem of getting projects like OpenBazaar funded.

It would stay in the block chain, which is a permanent record.\n\nThe best way to keep private is to treat addresses as disposable. In other words, addresses should only receive and redeem one payment. Electeum lets you do this. Just use a new receiving address for every payment.\n\nThings are a bit more complicated, though.
