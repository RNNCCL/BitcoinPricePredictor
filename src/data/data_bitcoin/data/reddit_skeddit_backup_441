Put another way, the velocity of the dollar in Argentina is surpassing the velocity of the peso.   This is simply not true (until the very last moment when the peso becomes worthless).\n\nMy point more broadly is that both of the definitions are faulty, and more specifically that the velocity of the peso in Argentina will increase until it becomes worthless (as people try to pass the less valuable currency along as quickly as possible).  I would agree that the velocity of dollars and bitcoin will also increase as people seek refuge in other stores of value, but the velocity of dollars will not *surpass* the velocity of pesos.  It is precisely the runaway velocity of the peso (too many pesos chasing too few goods) that creates this situation.\n\nMy broader point is that people use different forms of money differently; some forms they try to spend (i get airline miles!) and some forms they try to save (these gold coins will increase in value).  I believe that there is a third function as well, indexing value, but that is outside this specific case.\n\nYou have correctly pointed out that government enforced parity gives the advantage to the buyers, as the sellers are left with no choice as to what to accept.

In a free market, buyers have choices as well, and we end up with all those neat supply and demand curves, consumer and producer surplus, etc...  Since we are all wear both hats (buyer/seller) at different times, we make one choice as buyers and a different choice as sellers and (in the simplest sense) hoard one and spend the other.\n\nTo claim that in a free market buyers have no choices, or even that those choices are subordinate to sellers (supplier) demands, puts you squarely in the Supply Side camp.": 1, 'Verbatim- "When a government overvalues one type of money and undervalues another, the undervalued money will leave the country or disappear from circulation into hoards, while the overvalued money will flood into circulation." ergo, two types of money.\n\nWhile many use the debasement of same denomination silver coins as an example, Gresham did not limit his theory as you suggest.\n\nAs for Thier\'s Law, it specifically speaks of \'acceptance\'.  If you are the buyer in a transaction, you would be incentivized to use the opposite strategy.  This is not the opposite of Gresham\'s Law, rather just another view of supply and demand.\n\nGresham\'s Law addresses the concept of \'hoarding\', while Thier\'s basically repeats the refrain in terms of vendor preferences.\n\nBut let\'s not dwell in ivory towers of theories!

Peace.\n\nEdit: maybe this will help.\n\nIF Argentina *recognized* the dollar as well as the peso, and *made them equal in the eyes of the law* in all ways for commerce, and *legally tied the peso to the dollar 1:1* (this part is essential) such that people could use either currency but had to treat a peso like a dollar for commerce, but they continued to debase the peso continually, then people would *stop exchanging dollars*, but hoard them instead and trade only the debased currency, the peso.  Because when it comes time to pay at the store, you look in your wallet, and there\'s a dollar and a peso, and they both spend the same, so you hand over the peso, because you know the dollar is worth more in every way except in Argentinian law.  This is the effect predicted by Gresham.  Now take away the law that says "merchants have to accept either currency and pesos are always = dollars" and just allow people to use either currency at whatever the natural exchange rate is, and people start using dollars, because the government didn\'t impose a 1:1 exchange rate on them.

One of the most important things and benefits of SAFE is that SAFE has a token for the network, this token is useful for two things: \n\n1- Create network effect (because you can "mine" this token providing a Vault (hard drive spsace) to the network. Network effect is important for the network, look at Bitcoin, without network effect you have a small and slowly network (like i2p).\n\n2-Totally anonymous transactions (because SAFEcoin is going to work without a blockchain, instead will be using a transaction manager, in Safecoin not every node verify a transaction, only small groups chosen randomly, and finally the transactions is only recorded in the sender and the receiver, nobody more can know that this transaction happened).\n\nAlso in SAFE is pretty easy to develop and application that use the SAFE network. For example you can make a software similar to Spotify, Popcorntime, using the safe network instead of the actual Internet. \n\nThey had been working in this for more than 8 years, so I think is a real solid project and it will work. \n\nThe GUI looks nice and easy to use: https://github.com/maidsafe-archive/MaidSafe-Launcher/blob/next/src/maidsafe/launcher/ui/_design/mockups/login_create/login.png?raw=true': 1, 'This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](http://www.dailydot.com/politics/tor-astoria-timing-attack-client/) reduced by 86%.
