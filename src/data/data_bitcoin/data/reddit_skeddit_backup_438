If someone else could spend your coins the whole system was all but useless.\n>\n> Satoshi quickly put together a fix - the flaw was not actually difficult to correct.

That may give people a head start to  upgrading if any attackers are looking for the vulnerability in the changes."\n\nEven today, getting basic information on this bug is not easy:\n\nhttp://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/37403/which-release-fixed-cve-2010-5141-attacker-can-spend-any-coin\n\nIf a bug like this were found today, things would be quite different.

He simply asked me to research first before making a decision.

I created a Coinbase account and bought $20 worth. Then I created another Coinbase account to see how to send back and forth between accounts. Then I was hooked. Bitcoin is revolutionary and will have significant benefits around the world as it becomes more accepted by consumers and merchants.\n\nSo, in summary, the skeptics simply have not researched and do not understand the benefits and how it works.

However, it still has some flaws that prevent it from reaching that stated goal.  One of them is the inevitable centralization of mining, which already requires users to trust the top 4 mining pools, because they could do many bad things if they conspired to do it. (Actually, users must trust any combination of pools that add more than half of the total hashrate; but combinations with many small pools are unlikely to conspire, so one only needs to worry about cartels forming among the top 10 pools or so.)  Other problems are the lack of mechanisms to reward the relay nodes that are not miners, to stabilize the price, to adjust fees and rewards to the volume of usage, and to correct errors and thefts.  The PoW method is too expensive, the transaction fee (when it will be significant) will be unpredictable by clients, and there is no service guarantee.  The processing per client is proportional to the number of clients N, rather than K log(N) where K is the number of commercial partners as one woudl expect.  The fixed supply creates the expectation of price increase and therefore encourages hoarding.  And maybe more.\n\nSome of these flaws could be fixed, for example by specifying an exact (not minimum) transaction fee formula in the protocol, and including an "inflation tax" that grows exponentially with the age of the input coins.  However, the second change would never be accepted by the users who have invested in bitcoin.  Fixes for other flaws may require storing the ledger as a more complicated data structure than a linear list, or providing distributed and reliable auxiliary index structures of some sort.  And others, like error/theft correction and price stabiization, would require a few more brilliant inventions.  \n\nThen there are social and political problems, such as the extremely skewed distribution of coin holdings, the lack of legal support (it records possession, not ownership), its use as a tool of crime, the risks to national security, etc.)  One thing that puzzles me is why the US government is so friendly towards a project that is meant to evade the AML controls that it built at great cost.  Perhaps one day that policy will change, and bitcoin will be banned in the US and allied nations, as it is in China -- or worse.\n\nBut the most objectionable problem that I see now is the attempt by many bitcoin investors and entrepreneurs to "sell" bitcoin as a good investiment to people who are not capable of evaluating its risks, and the probability of it "going to the moon".  Those attempts are generally selfish, because the only way those "salesmen" will make profit from their investment is by taking money from new investors; and they need to convince investors to pour more than 1 M USD/day just to sustain the price..  Given the total uncertainly about the future of the price (which even experts cannot predict or explain), "selling" bitcon as a good investment is basically scamming.

Fortunately, most of those exposed keys were found first by a "white hat" hacker who had been monitoring the blockchain for weak signatures, the bug was fixed within a few hours, and the affected bitcoins were all colected by the hacker and returned to BCI.

These robots would continuously buy small amounts of coins at a premium from normal users, probably using non-existing dollars.  Those were otherwise normal trades, visible in the trade logs and summaries.\n\n+ Eventually, the bitcoins would be transferred from those slave accounts to one master account, in larger lumps.  These transfers were recorded in the database as fake trades, all for the same USD amount, independently of the BTC amount and the current BTC price.  These trades were not visible in the trade log or summaries. They are visible in plots of the price per BTC generated from the database, as  trades executed at random BTC prices ranging from near zero to much higher than market.\n\n+ Bitcoins were then moved manually from MtGOX\'s hot and/or cold wallets  to unknown addresses.  These withdrawals were not recorded in the database, so the master account still showed a huge but bogus BTC balance.  Indeed, the purpose of the master account may have been to hide the discrepancy between the wallets and the sum of the clients\' BTC balances.\n\nI won\'t bet on this theory, but it seems to fit what I have read.

Without a hard asset backing up the dollar, it is supported only by the \xe2\x80\x9cfull faith and credit of the federal government.\xe2\x80\x9d -- *Mike Patton* (article author)\n\nMike is showing his ignorance of how our financial system works.  The US Dollar is backed by debt.  Federal Reserve-issued currency is backed by [Treasury bonds and mortgage securities](http://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/quarterly_balance_sheet_developments_report_201505.pdf) (page 4).  Bank deposits are backed by bank loans.  Paper currency and deposits are equally usable for payment, and any ATM will convert one to the other.\n\nTo the extent that mortgages and bank loans are secured by assets, the money issued against them is backed by hard assets, just at second remove.  The unsecured bank loans and government bonds are backed by the earning power of the borrowers.  In the latter case, it's earning power by virtue of force, but still an earning power.\n\nFinally, there are 260 million ounces of gold reserves still on the books of the Fed.  It's not convertible, and the Fed can't even get its hands on it -- it's stored at depositories by the Treasury.  But it still exists as an asset if they wanted to apply it as currency backing.
