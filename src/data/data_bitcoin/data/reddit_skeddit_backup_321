Scale and mainstream adoption are secondary, and as the article describes; most appropriately a result of organic adoption where the highest value lies: that always has been and will be (until the state no longer exists) the thwarting of centrally controlled money supply and all forms of capital control.\n\nThe silly vapid mass of bitcoin newcomers wants to distance themselves from the stigma of black markets and the anti-state nature of bitcoin; but all they have succeeded in doing is produce something of a contrived wave of merchant acceptance of the token (and only as proxy for the dollar/euro/yen).  Their understanding of bitcoin extends little further than some decentralized paypal; a tool with which to stick it to banks and credit card companies.  They assume that bitcoin is already money, or take for granted the implications that it is actually not yet.\n\nBitcoin must be (organically) valued for itself; for the utility of the unit, as share of a useful network, as the present discounted value of a commodity who's future value (as fully actualized, network good, money) will be much much higher.\n\nAll this other stuff is a sideshow.

First, the moment that you place an order in LBC, the bitcoins are taken from my LBC account and placed in escrow under your account. From then on I cannot retrieve them as long as the order is open. All I can do is release them to you. Of course, you cannot retrieve them either until I release them. Furthermore, only you can cancel the order, releasing the escrow back to me. I cannot do so. Hence, I have no incentive to take your money and refuse to release your escrowed BTC. I cannot get them back.

For iPhones I recommend [Breadwallet](http://breadwallet.com/) and for Android [Mycelium](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet&hl=en) \n* Create a [BIP38 encrypted paper wallet](https://www.bitaddress.org/bitaddress.org-v2.9.10-SHA256-445e44cfd04c8f1ea8f732c3ae7277b0166fdb3e2109251c54e4b367983fe04d.html) to see what "cold storage" is like. If you are interested in seeing the possibilities of bitcoin, it\'s quite fun/interesting to see storing digital currency offline on a piece of paper. \n* Make a donation to a charity *(such as [Sean\'s Outpost](http://www.seansoutpost.com/) which provides meals to the homeless community in Pensacola, Florida).* Sending a donation is a nice way to see what sending bitcoin is like. \n* *(I was a stingy bastard and only tipped 1000 bits)* but if you play video games you could get a package from Humble for a $1 /u/changetip.

When you signup they use these processes plus KYC/AML laws to then try to determine how much information they need from an individual to allow a purchase. \n\nIn **my experience** I have been able to do exactly this. I link my bank account and then I\'m ready to go.\n\nBut I know some people on this sub have run into trouble and needed to provide more information/were denied. This is definitely frustrating but has to do with the reversibility/un-reversibility combo between today\'s payment systems and bitcoin (plus [KYC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_your_customer)/[AML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Money_laundering#Enforcement)). \n\n**Do note though, once you are setup and "in the system", it\'s really easy**. \n\nAfter getting myself setup on a few bitcoin vendors/exchanges, I can very easily buy & sell bitcoin without hassle.

It\'s not necessarily true that "no one would buy 1 billion dollars of Bitcoin", though it\'s a reasonable opinion to have.\n\nJust as a fun mental exercise (not necessarily for you, but for anyone interested), though, consider the possibility that a wealthy someone (e.g. Richard Branson) *would* decide to buy $1B of Bitcoin. Why might they do that, especially when factoring in slippage costs? I can think of at least one reason: start a massive pump.\n\nThe pump would be massive on a scale we haven\'t yet even approached. To say that it would start a new Bitcoin Bubble is the biggest understatement you could make. It would spur a Superbubble.\n\nAnd sure, depending on how things played out from there, they might eventually dump (typically that\'s the market play that follows a pump, after all). But even allowing this contingency, there is much to consider... if the Superbubble was particularly effective, it could conceivably destabilize other fiat monies and begin the Hyperbitcoinization process, which would serve as an incentive *not* to dump as Bitcoin ascends.\n\nOf course, I expect you to downvote me, ridicule me, and link this comment to /r/Buttcoin so they can do the same.

When the reward halves, so does the money flowing to miners (assuming the price remains the same), and so does the energy consumption (approximately). So we can then double the price to get back to about the same amount of mining and the same power consumption.\n\n2) Demand for bitcoin significantly outpaces the halving, thus pushing up the price. The growth in mining would reach a point where governments at various levels (central and local authorities) would get involved. Some would create new regulations limiting mining, maybe through issuing licences? Others would outright ban mining (imagine a city authority in China that controls the power grid).\n\nAll of these pressures would cause mining to move to mining friendly locations, i.e. in addition to the current pressures that push miners to cheap electricity, low cooling costs, good internet connection and friendly regulation (e.g. Iceland with its cool climate and geothermal power).\n\nThose places won't have the power generation capacity to meet the demand, some increase in supply would occur but not enough to meet all of the demand. Hence the mining community would start investing in renewable power solutions - probably PV solar and some places that come to mind are Nevada, Spain, parts of China, Morocco(?), Turkey, Australia, Mexico. i.e. Sunny places with existing infrastructure and stable governments.": 3, 'And there would be a clear and permanent record of this transaction for the rest of time that anyone in the world could browse.  \n  \nThink about why a government or even a criminal would use that.

An impulse buy by a single person would merely move those coins from some of those holders to that new holder.

There are different categories of wire transfers, some take 1 business days, some take hours or could be instant. Depending on required speed, the cost could be $30-300 but for sending $1M-$1B it doesn\'t seem to be an issue\n\n- to move smaller amounts, remittances by migrants, there are both offline and online options to do it instantly. Sending money via cash agents is usually instant and providers like Xoom and Transfast support instant transfers from a linked bank account. Most providers offer an instant transfer when a customer uses a debit card\n\n- Costs have been on a steady decline. The global weighted average cost for remittances is now around 6%, but for digital send in some top corridors it could reach 0.5% including fees and FX markup (e.g., USA-to-India)\n\nMore importantly, consumers of x-border remittances are pretty happy with their choices. Actually, so happy that 90% continue using cash agents, although they could save 50%+ and time if they just switch to sending money digitally with the same provider.\n\nYes, so-called "full bitcoin" would be an innovative solution, but there doesn\'t seem to be enough problem among potential customers for a mass adoption to happen on its own.

With sidechain soon, with an organized proof of burn if you specify this in the protocol.": 1, 'well now they have a fire under their ass to finish thinking and start doing': 1, 'Great answer, thanks.': 1, "It doesn't matter. It's cosmetic.": 0, "That's fine, I'm all for core releasing their own implementation.  Personally I hope XT inspires them to break this stupid gridlock and finally make a decision.": 2, "You mean competition over bandwidth? Right now, we're competing over access to cheap power and access to good ASICs, and bandwidth isn't a concern. This gives China a pretty strong advantage in the mining sector. Adding another variable to the mix, like bandwidth, should make things a bit more even, with different niches in different regions. North America might have cheap power and cheap bandwidth but expensive capital costs, for example, whereas China would have cheap power and cheap capital costs but expensive bandwidth.\n\nNo matter what, competition will be intense. I think that increasing the block size limit makes miners compete over something that actually matters: the ability to include large numbers of transactions into blocks quickly. That's much better than simply competing over the number of hashes that can be calculated per block, in my opinion.": 1, "China has too large a share of all bitcoin mining right now. If the block size increase reduces the amount of mining in China by making bandwidth more important, that will improve centralization. \n\nHaving too much Bitcoin infrastructure in one country is a problem because it makes Bitcoin susceptible to political attacks. That is particularly true of China due to China's history of censorship and financial controls. One of the big reasons why the internet is slow between China and the rest of the world is the Great Firewall/Golden Shield project.\n\nHowever, I think that the blocksize increases will leave mining and running full nodes in China still feasible. I believe your 12% figure is for residential broadband speeds. Running a full node on a home internet connection is not the best way to do it. Most full nodes will be run on virtual private servers like Linode, Rackspace, Amazon AWS, or the like. Those datacenters have much better internet connectivity than residential areas.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that a miner can run a full node in an urban datacenter with high bandwidth in Shenzhen or Hong Kong and mine to it with miners on a remote farm in Sichuan. Residential internet connections do not need to be the limiting factor.": 1, 'I think that 8mb will give lightening network or some other solution enough time to mature and present a better solution': 2, "Yes, exactly, now I clarify it a bit better. Here it's clarified: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h6tmm/question_for_forkers/cu4qriu": 2, "Hi. I'm a medium-scale miner who recently switched over to Bitcoin XT. https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3h6nh0/toomim_bros_bitcoin_mining_concern_supports/\n\nIf you read BIP101 (Gavin's blocksize increase proposal implemented in XT), you'll see that it's an immediate increase to 8 MB, followed by doubling every 2 years for 20 years. The final blocksize cap should be 8192 MB in 2036. I think this growth rate might be enough for all of bitcoin's demand for the next 20 years, and it might not. In any case, it sounds technically feasible for us to be transmitting 8 GB of data every 10 minutes in 2036 in the bitcoin network. With the hundreds of millions of dollars already invested in bitcoin mining, although it wouldn't be easy, we could still do it today.\n\nI think the fundamental problem that the XT release addresses isn't the blocksize increase, but rather developer gridlock. Up until now, all important decisions about Bitcoin's future have been made by a select few. Bitcoin has been an oligopoly of the developers. For the most part, those developers have done things pretty well. Recently, however, they have gotten gridlocked through their consensus process, and haven't been able to agree on something that the vast majority of bitcoin users agree upon. \n\nOne of the things that some of the developers have been afraid of is fear itself. They've been worried about the effects of a hard fork, and worried that a hard fork might shatter confidence in the stability of Bitcoin. The truth is, hard forks are not a big deal. Bitcoin has gone through several of them already and survived, the most recent of which was BIP66. P2pool had a very rushed but successful hard fork a while ago in which about 1.5 weeks passed between the first release of the new version and >95% penetration of that new version and rejection of all old versions. The network consensus mechanism requires 75% of miners to be using XT before changes to the protocol are made. That would mean there would need to be 3 miners in support for every miner against before anything happens. With that level of support among miners, it's likely that the fork would complete successfully once initiated.\n\nIf Bitcoin XT reaches 75% saturation, that indicates that miners overwhelmingly support the blocksize cap changes. Since Bitcoin XT does nothing controversial until that 75% threshold is reached, I don't see what the big fuss is about. It will only enact a currently-controversial policy if the controversy about the policy is over.\n\nThe basic structure of the Bitcoin protocol and network enables democratic actions like this. I much prefer rule by the miners and users of bitcoin over rule by the five or so people who have git commit access to the first Bitcoin client's source code repository. I don't trust any one group of people to make all the right decisions regarding how Bitcoin clients should be programmed. When the people in charge of making a client make mistakes, I want the option to switch clients to something more in line with my principles. If the client that I want to use does something that other clients think is harmful to Bitcoin, I want their clients to ignore mine. Consensus on the contents of the ledger will be determined by proof of work.

The ideal would be a BIP, but it has been made clear that they were not willing. The move to XT has been forced by small blockers, no one else.

At my mine, we spend about 1/80th as much on internet connectivity as we do on electricity. For that, we get two 100 Mbps fiber connections, one of which serves as a backup, plus a 4/2 Mbps wireless link as a second backup. For the main internet line, we average about 1% of our pipe's capacity. That 1% is enough to run two full nodes, two p2pool nodes, and about 1 PH/s of miners. If we paid 80x as much on bandwidth and used closer to 100% of our pipe, we would have enough capacity for 8000x what we're currently using with 1 MB blocks. Coincidentally, that's about where BIP101's block size increases will end, at 8192 MB in 2036. So we're basically 20 years ahead.\n\nProcessing transactions should be the core of a miner's business.

This site lists a few of the options that are out there with English names: http://www.comparevps.com/\n\nIf you really want security, then you can build your own server and do a colocation. That's pretty cheap, and the blocksize increase won't really increase the cost of colocation significantly until the blocks get past around 20 MB average each. \n\nIf you really really want security, then you build your own server room somewhere. That will cost more and limit your location options if you need a 100 Mbps line instead of a 10 Mbps line, but security tends to be expensive. If your application demands that level of security, then you can probably afford the server room.\n\nThe bandwidth costs to keep up with the blockchain are significantly smaller for wallet full-nodes than for miners. Miners have to get and send new blocks quickly in order to avoid having their mined blocks be orphaned. Wallets just need to not be more than a couple minutes behind. Miners need to not be more than a few tens of seconds behind.

At least not for the endgame scenario of Bitcoin being the only money in the world that many dream of.

A use of language.  More specifically, an agreed-upon set of rules whereby parties may exchange information.

This has occasionally been the case with testnet coins, whereby folks will on occasion buy & sell testnet coins, only to have the developers have to reset the network to avoid them becoming a commodity of value in and of themselves.\n\nLastly, the concepts at play that created Bitcoin, can equally function outside of Bitcoin\'s network.  And one can argue outside of the internet, and even outside of a digital medium.  If one can communicate a cryptographically signed message via oral communication, radio transmission or even smoke signal, we need to re-consider what is actually taking place.  Is this really "money transmission"?  Perhaps not, if no value is assigned.  But what if someone (even at a later time) were to place a value on such messages?  Would it then be considered money transmission and subject to all the regulation that defines that?
