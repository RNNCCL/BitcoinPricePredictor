Personally I would tweak things a little bit, but using both a seed (e.g. email address) and a secret (passphrase) and a strong key derivation algorithm (PBKDF2 and scrypt) instead of a simple hash, goes a long way preventing the kind of stupid cracks that were possible with the infamous brainwallet.\n\nThe guys from WarpWallet have a challenge for 20BTC for a very weak password (8 alphanumerical characters) with no seed and no-one has claimed it. There's a reason for that. Even if you optimize the hashing it will take you a long long time to brute force it, even with GPU optimized algorithms.\n\nHere's what I don't like about WarpWallet though:\n\n- It's in JavaScript, therefore slower than it needs to be. Also it runs in a web browser so beware!\n\n- I could not audit the code. That's partly because I'm not familiar with CoffeeScript and IcedCoffee, but also partly because the dependencies on that project are a bit over the top. \n\n- It generates a single public address. I'd rather have one passphrase+seed generate a list of bitcoin addresses and not put all my eggs in a single basket.\n\n- It uses both scrypt and PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA1. And scrypt uses PBKDF2 internally. If you're going to use two different key derivation functions, you might as well mix up the hash function a bit. And SHA1 is quite old, we should stop using it.\n\nHere's what I did\n\n- I have my own code written in C. The project has a single dependency on OpenSSL, which is used only to convert the private key into public key (i.e. not something critical to generate the private key).\n\n- I use scrypt with different parameters. PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA3\n\n- My code generates a seed which is then hashed repeatedly to generate as many bitcoin addresses as I want.\n": 1, 'It\'s not *really* relevant, but [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/3gycp1/experiment_money_sent_to_brainwallet_w_password/cu2va9k) is what happened to the last guy who thought cracking was hard. Gave me some hints and I had his passphrase in a little over 30 minutes.\n\nI have no particular desire to take up on your bet. You "winning" proves nothing. The average person cannot reliably generate a secure passwords or passphrases. The average person *can*, with some effort, memorize a randomly generated secure passphrase.\n\nIf you want to "prove" your point, you need to put together some sort of study with a significant number of people. Have them come up with passphrases using your scheme, hash the passphrases with unsalted MD5 (weak on purpose to make the cracking costs reasonable), and give out all the hints and hashes. You can then extrapolate the MD5 cracking times to what they would have been with a more reasonable hash. If you want to help people make better passphrases, let\'s do some actual fraking ***science***.\n\nFinally - there\'s no reason to use brainwallets. They don\'t need rehabilitation. They need replacing. WarpWallet is strictly better. I finally implemented the WarpWallet derivation algorithm in C and benchmarked it today. It\'s on the order of *ten thousand times more secure* - even more if you use a salt as recommended.

These contributors don't necessarily know what is in the block (not until it is 'found' and broadcast), but they can mine the headers nonetheless. Just by increasing the nonce in the headers and fiddling with the timestamp can they 'mine' the block - without knowing anything else.\n\n(Using protocols/pools that support getblocktemplate it's possible for users to assemble a block according to some policy set by the pool, thereby allowing them to know the contents of the block they're mining, and offering much better transparency)\n\nThey publish 'shares' to the pools to prove they have done some mining.

If Bitcoin's userbase increased 10 fold overnight, it would be an absolute mess.  Blocks would be completely filled, transactions would take hours or days or even weeks to confirm, and it would put most of those new people off of using Bitcoin forever.\n\nLightning network isn't anywhere close to ready.  The best solution we have at this point is to give ourselves a very large amount of overhead via blocksize, as much as we can practically do with current hardware.  Otherwise we're in for a world of hurt when the next wave of adoption hits.\n\nWe wouldn't have to use up all of that 8MB of space in the blocks.

The 8MB could be treated as surge space for the most part.": 9, 'I think he just answered why small blocks lead to centralization...': 1, '* it is the most crucial aspect of Satoshis discovery\n\nI\'d argue that it is not. Remember the goal was to produce a trustless system, meaning that you don\'t have to worry at all about the other stakeholders to influence the ledger other than with what assets they control. The fact that some stakeholders (miners/nodes) have some control (with as much of that control removed as possible) is undesirable, but necessary. It\'s necessary because of the security properties that define Bitcoin (break the underlying assumptions, and the security of Bitcoin goes out the window).\n\n* 3) Nearly every clearing model is based upon a net deferred settlement cycle, i.e. settlement does not happen until certain time-periods every day when all obligations to deliver are conducted through Delivery vs Payment (DvP) or Payment vs Payment (PvP). This is normal, and will work the same way even with the internet\'s "base money". When settlement is conducted, it is crucial that the multiple accounts can have a simultaneous discharge of obligations, i.e. the blocksize needs to be large enough to allow for the net settlement between the multitude of accounts/addresses to be included in one block/transaction which may be significantly larger than 1mb, even if the blockchain purely functions as a large value payments system.\n\nThe blocksize needs to be large enough to maintain reasonable usefulness while also maintaining the underlying security properties of Bitcoin. If that blocksize is large enough to be used for certain financial services, then great. If not, then other solutions will have to be entertained. It should be noted that very few devs agree with keeping the 1 mb blocksize limit, they only disagree with how it should grow and how urgent it is.\n\nI think it\'s also important to differentiate different types of side-chains and caching layers (e.g. Lightning) and how they operate. Lightning would be considered for the most part Bitcoin proper... it trustlessness properties would be similar to Bitcoin *as long as the security properties of Bitcoin are intact*. Sidechains could be defined as any number of methods to peg another system to Bitcoin. In the case of a privately controlled chain (not censorship resistant in the least, coins can be forfeited due to regulation/whims) you could still have very fast settlement times on the order of many thousands of transactions per second.

The additional info makes it so that you truly would have to be personally targeted by an attacker to be at risk.  Additionally, as minimal as it may be, having 4 salts instead of 1 can slow down an attacker because they have to try every possible combination of the ways you can format a name, phone number, and date of birth.\n\nAfter giving this some thought, what I would like to do is give people the option to chose their "type" of salt that they want to use.  For example, you can chose to enter personal info, or you can switch modes and enter a username, password, and PIN code, for example.

': 1, '* > The mining majority always sets the rules\n\n    You are proposing majority rule.\n\n    Yet, Bitcoin isn\'t about majority rule; rather, Bitcoin is about **decentralization** of power.\n\n    --------\n\n    The premise of Bitcoin is merely that a bunch of independent people are less likely to be malicious (or catastrophically incompetent) than a small group of related people, so Bitcoin is designed with anti-spam algorithms (notably, Hashcash) and incentives to try to keep the authority composed of as many independent people as possible, though, as you point out, Bitcoin\'s design doesn\'t guarantee it.\n\n    That is, Bitcoin is designed on the assumption that the collection of miners is dominated by general interests (as opposed to a special interest), and that the hashrate is sufficiently high to prevent any special interest from gaining significant authority.\n\n    **General interests, typically, aren\'t too sophisticated, and they become dumber as a mob mentality is fomented.** If anything, Bitcoin is based on the assumption that the original ideas of Bitcoin are pretty darn smart and that a bunch of independent people are too disorganized to collude to change the rules easily.\n\n    So, for Bitcoin to be sufficiently decentralized, Bitcoin must be managed by enough people such that they are too disorganized to effect much change. Otherwise, what\'s the point of Bitcoin?\n\n* > The Bitcoin Core approach isn\'t just boring and perceptive, it\'s also untenable.\n\n    You are not listening.\n\n    Bitcoin (the system) cannot do *everything* that people want to do with BTC; so, the solution is to make your own system that is usable with BTC through a 2-way&nbsp;peg.\n\n    That is, the solution is not to create your own token, but rather to use Bitcoin\'s token; this doesn\'t detach BTC from Bitcoin\'s blockchain, but rather this attaches your blockchain to BTC.\n\n    I think this is how it will play out: Blockstream will create a number of blockchain systems that are specifically useful to banks, but these systems won\'t supply their own unique tokens; instead, you\'ll have to send your BTC tokens to these systems through what\'s called a 2-way&nbsp;peg, and in this way, you\'ll be able to do interesting and even proprietary things with your BTC that you cannot do with just plain Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x94and more importantly, you can transfer those tokens *back* to Bitcoin when you\'re finished, thereby escaping the dangers of some other network; this is what people mean by "The Internet of Money".\n\n    For instance, Blockstream\'s [Alpha](https://github.com/ElementsProject/elements) sidechain offers "confidential&nbsp;transactions", which don\'t allow onlookers to see exactly how much value has been transferred, which is very appealing to banks.\n\n    Furthermore:\n\n    * Losing miners possibly reduces the participants with general interests.\n\n    * Losing hashrate lowers the barrier to authority.\n\n    How do you ensure that the population of people who maintain the Bitcoin system (miners, etc.) is sufficiently decentralized?\n\n    What is the minimum hashrate required to keep it sufficiently decentralized? That is, what is the minimum hashrate require to keep any special interest from gaining significant authority?\n\n    How do you communicate to everybody what that minimum hashrate is? How do you get people to pay enough to keep that minimum hashrate? For example, after the next halving, etc., will the hashrate still be above that minimum?\n\n    That is, you cannot just increase the block size willy nilly; a sufficient hashrate is not something that you can just mandate, and disturbing the system as it currently works should not be taken lightly.\n\n* Bitcoin must be scaled in order to be self-sustaining; the volume of transactions must grow tremendously in order for Bitcoin usage to be **both cheap and secure**.\n\n    However, one data center for processing Visa transactions was handling at&nbsp;least [2500&nbsp;transactions per second](http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/tech/news/story/2012-03-25/visa-data-center/53774904/1) in the year *2012*; at an average of [600&nbsp;bytes per transaction](https://tradeblock.com/blog/bitcoin-network-capacity-analysis-part-2-macro-transaction-trends), that would require a 900&nbsp;MB&nbsp;block in Bitcoin. [According to Visa](http://usa.visa.com/about-visa/visanet.jsp), VisaNet can handle 56&nbsp;000 transactions per second, which would require a 20.160&nbsp;***G***B block, yet don\'t we want Bitcoin to be *much* more pervasive than Visa? Upping the block size just does not bring on the kind of scale that we all desire.\n\n    So, regardless of your view on how big blocks should be, a consolidation of transactions (e.g., the Lightning Network) is ultimately the only reasonable option for scaling Bitcoin that we can start working on right now.\n\n    After all, it\'s more important to secure 100 thousand purchases of coffee than it is to secure any particular purchase of one coffee.

The Core Developers are too centralized, and their position of "everyone that\'s loud enough gets a veto" is untenable.

I think they are potentially very cool tech that have the potential to radically improve the overall bitcoin eco-system. However, they are not the only solution to scaling bitcoin.\n\nThe fact is, blockchains can scale in line with technological growth, and maintain their decentralized nature. As machine power and network capacity grow, it is practical to increase the maximum size of blocks. Due to the exponential nature of technological growth, this will massively increase the capacity of the bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIf we double the max block size every 2 years for 40 years, we will have the capacity to support *trillions* of transaction per day, all while preserving the ability for everyone to have cheap direct access to the monetary system.\n\nThis is why I support BIP101 *and* I support sidechains and the lightning network.': 1, "What is that? 2^20 MB? 1048576&nbsp;MB? 1.05&nbsp;***T***iB every 10 minutes?\n\nWell, let's suppose for a moment that even under such a heavy burden, Bitcoin remains sufficiently decentralized (as described above). With the 600&nbsp;bytes per average transaction that we see today, that would allow about 2912711 transactions per second, which is only 52 times what Visa's network can handle today, despite a block size that is a million times the size it is today. Sounds... like the wrong way to think about how to scale...\n\nAnyway, like most of the other proles, you are missing the fundamental point: Before scaling can really be considered, it's much more important to get right the infrastructure for evolving Bitcoin *in&nbsp;any&nbsp;direction*; as explained in the previous comments, your solution is an inadequate approach.\n\nSo, what I'm explaining to *you* is that your approach will make Bitcoin increasingly a matter of *majority* rule, whereas the goal of Bitcoin is\xe2\x80\x94to a large number of people\xe2\x80\x94instead to make it extremely difficult to attain a majority for any change whatsoever.

In this work, we\nextract and analyze the core of the Bitcoin protocol, which we term the Bitcoin backbone, and\nprove two of its fundamental properties which we call common prefix and chain quality in the\nstatic setting where the number of players remains fixed. Our proofs hinge on appropriate and\nnovel assumptions on the \xe2\x80\x9chashing power\xe2\x80\x9d of the adversary relative to network synchronicity;\nwe show our results to be tight under high synchronization.\nNext, we propose and analyze applications that can be built \xe2\x80\x9con top\xe2\x80\x9d of the backbone protocol,\nspecifically focusing on Byzantine agreement (BA) and on the notion of a public transaction\nledger. Regarding BA, we observe that Nakamoto\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion falls short of solving it,\nand present a simple alternative which works assuming that the adversary\xe2\x80\x99s hashing power is\nbounded by 1/3. The public transaction ledger captures the essence of Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s operation as\na cryptocurrency, in the sense that it guarantees the liveness and persistence of committed\ntransactions. Based on this notion we describe and analyze the Bitcoin system as well as a\nmore elaborate BA protocol, proving them secure assuming high network synchronicity and\nthat the adversary\xe2\x80\x99s hashing power is strictly less than 1/2, while the adversarial bound needed\nfor security decreases as the network desynchronizes.\n\nSome interesting discussion in the bottom of the article:\n\n> While these are encouraging results, we have demonstrated deviations that are of concern for\nthe proper operation of Bitcoin. Importantly, we show that as the network ceases to synchronize\nfast enough compared to the proof-of-work rate (i.e., the worst-case time that takes honest players\nto \xe2\x80\x9chear\xe2\x80\x9d each other becomes substantial compared to the time it takes to solve a proof of work),\nthe honest majority property ceases to hold and the bound offered by our analysis that is required\nto obtain a robust transaction ledger approaches 0 as f approaches 1. Note that the effects of bad\nsynchronization is in the maintenance of the common prefix property, which is the critical property\nfor showing agreement.\n': 5}, ('2-way Bitcoin ATMs in Amsterdam?', 24): {"You'll have a hard time finding one.

A $20 transaction fee to create a single channel with a LN hub, means those 2.8 billion people will never be able to use the LN. They will not be locking "$5,000 worth of BTC" in a LN channel.
