That\'s like saying "How do you even charge somebody for possession and distribution of child porn."  Because, as we all know, that never happens.  Just ask Jared.\n\n> Lots of governments banned internet piracy, how did that work out?\n\nInternet piracy is easy, and its something a lot of people want to actively participate in.  It\'s also very easy to remain "anonymous."  \n\nIf bitcoin is banned as a use of a currency, exchanges will end and no legitimate businesses will accept them.  If exchanges are no longer available then people will have to conduct bitcoin transactions for fiat on a person-to-person basis, which substantially removes anonymity and ease of access (unlike piracy where I can do it from my own home at 2am in my underwear).  And if bitcoin can\'t be used at legal venues, it sharply diminishes its role as a store of value.  Again, it becomes limited to person-to-person transactions.  And many people would not want to accept it in a jurisdiction where it\'s banned because it\'s largely useless to them as a currency.  \n\n> If CISPA has failed repeatedly then why wouldn\'t a bill to ban bitcoin fail too?\n\nOh you mean CISA which was passed last week?  \n\nMore people care about their internet privacy than they do about bitcoin right now.

And the sad reality is, most people don\'t even give a shit about CISA.\n\n> Some people have a lot of money to invest in bitcoin, why wouldn\'t they also spend money to defend it? \n\nThey will.  I don\'t doubt that any law would be fought.  and it will be stuck in legal limbo for years.  During that time, it will significantly dampen any additional involvement by people weary of getting involved in something with an uncertain future.  I will even be generous and give them a 50/50 chance of success.  In that time, Bitcoin in that jurisdiction (U.S. I\'m assuming we\'re talking about now) would go through a dark period.  Expect to see exchanges close, and businesses stop accepting it.  The value of the coin will plummet.  And those people with money may end up deciding the risk/reward is no longer worth fighting for it and slowly move onto the next big thing they can champion.\n\nBut don\'t let that dark reality stop you from believing in your delusional belief that none of those risks exists.  \n\n**And just to reiterate .. my problem isn\'t with a belief that these things WILL happen.
