Even better, what\'s the plan to start funding core developers *before* the Foundation goes belly up?\n\nMike Hearn has build a fantastic crowdfunding tool: Lighthouse. We can use Lighthouse to crowdfund core development but we have to address several lingering problems. As much as we may hate the Foundation, they "solved" these problems for some values of "solved". \n\n* Who gets the money and how is it apportioned between developers? Giving it to a single developer directly might be an option, but that would be too much power. Giving it to a group of developers re-creates the Foundation board. \n\n* Who controls the money? Multi-sig? Who are the signers? Again, if there is a "board" making decisions, haven\'t we just re-created the Foundation all over again?\n\n* How do we keep a steady stream of donations beyond the first fundraising event? It\'s easy to raise money for the first month. What happens after the buzz dies down? A membership model was a good solution.\n\nDespite the many obvious problems with the Foundation, they did (for a time) solve the problem of raising money for core development and apportioning it between a couple of developers. \nBashing the Foundation is easy and well deserved, but ultimately they are self-destructing.

I didn\'t say that Bitcoin used doubles everywhere, just that it uses them, and that this is safe.\n\nWhen I was still nervous about using doubles for values in 2011, I [rewrote ValueFromAmount](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=3786.msg53905#msg53905) so that it worked with strings instead of doubles. But then (as you\'ll see in that linked thread) Gavin discovered that Bitcoin amounts always fit in a double, and I learned that this was unnecessary.\n\nDoubles can be used as a perfectly-precise 53-bit unsigned integer. That is, storing any integer value from 0 to 2^53 in a double is guaranteed to give you the same integer when you access the double again. It turns out that this is sufficient for storing any possible Bitcoin value as the number of satoshi. As such, Bitcoin Core *could* use doubles instead of int64s everywhere for storing Bitcoin values. But this would be slower and more error-prone, so it isn\'t done. Doing this *is* very convenient in languages with no built-in int64 type, though. If you\'re hacking together your own large integer type to avoid using doubles for Bitcoin values, you\'re wasting time.\n\nDoubles also have a field for "where to put the binary point". Given a double containing an integer amount of satoshi, you can always losslessly modify it to "move the decimal point to the right 8 places" to get a BTC amount. This is lossless because you can always convert back to the original value, but the resulting double often does not exactly equal the input value, so additional rounding steps are required. So it\'s perfectly safe to store Bitcoin amounts in a double, though rounding will be required on input/output. However, doing math (including comparisons) on such values is tricky and should not normally be done until after converting to satoshi like `round($btc_amount * 100000000)` and then sticking to integer math.': 1, 'Doubles can be used as a 54 bit signed integer with no loss of precision.': 1, "It's just after 20,999,999?": 1, "Because 2^51 is not big enough? hehe.

FYI the code was adapted for 0.10 as the jcmorgan patch was for 0.9 codebase and needed some changes so it\'s not just some copy and paste as you try to make out. There\'s real work there time and testing went into getting it suitable for 0.10. And yes, there is attribution to jcmorgan in the codebase.

We already work on things in addition to sidechains, and if there were something strictly better than sidechains we\'d gladly adopt that over them. It\'s not like there is some sidechain app coin that loses value if people aren\'t adopting sidechains.\n\n[For example, Adam has lately been on a kick about "extension blocks" with consensus code in a sandbox as a sidechain alternative way to extend Bitcoin; but I am not a fan of it because it bring in the same scaling induced centralization problems that larger block sizes have... but perhaps we\'ll figure out some way to solve that.]\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is that there is "sidechains the (semi-)specific technical solution" e.g. two-way peg mechanism, which no one is particularly married to... and "sidechains the end deliverable", which is a world where people can create and enjoy extended functionality for the Bitcoin cryptocurrency without asking permission and without creating excessive risk for disinterested parties, which we\'re much more committed to... but prior to the two-way peg we didn\'t have a mechanism to achieve it.\n\n> What irks me a bit as well is that the business model of Blockstream is not clear\n\nWho said its /completely/ clear to anyone?

I am not, in fact-- and wasn\'t prior to Bitcoins existence. It turns out a good senior engineer salary is more than six times my annual base living expenses; I\'ve been working full time for about 20 years, and I\'m not a financial idiot; (plus my partner of ten years is an attorney). But none of this is any of your business.\n\nMoreover, [see the mitigation response](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/31ezh6/tweetstorm_jeff_garzik_conspiracy_theories_about/cq1e4iz) I gave to drak: Because of it even if I, say, develop a terrible gambling addition and somehow go broke; and somehow my partner were disabled and somehow the ecosystem changed in a way where I couldn\'t get a job elsewhere in it (or at my prior employers) in an instant; and then even if blockstream went evil and demanded I do something that I thought was unethical or was adverse to Bitcoin, I still wouldn\'t by stuck over that vs salary because we designed that to be intrinsically safe though a special severance agreement. -- Not because it\'s needed, but because the building things which, to our best ability, can\'t screw people over by design instead of trust is a principle of the company which we ruthless ripped off of Bitcoin itself.\n\nSo you\'re just left with "maybe Gmaxwell might /also/ turn evil just because", maybe I\'ve been evil all along or someone might show up with a literal gun and demand I do evil; these are unavoidable risks that vest in any person without regard to any company. And that is why we have maintained and developed Bitcoin in a way that makes it safe against that kind of risk:  Every person has the simple recourse to just not run new software I\'ve written that doesn\'t do what they think it should do-- you can even continue to benefit from and improve the old stuff I previously gave way since it\'s all freely licensed in an irrevocable way and developed transparently with many participants. (And this commitment runs deep; it\'s part of why we don\'t do traditional "autoupdates")\n\nGosh, it makes me feel like I\'ve given you a pint of blood and yet you cry "more!"-- are you that insatiable? Would you be only satisfied if every last shred of my freedom and free will were stripped of me, if all my efforts were failures, and I left completely in your personal control and beholden to your interests?  Because thats what it sounds like to me.  It\'s so strange to see Bitcoiners act in a way which seems to carelessly and thoughtlessly \'anti-freedom\', though sadly it\'s not a new sight-- I don\'t think thats an unfair characterization here, according to you I should not be free to associate with whom I choose, how I choose, because maybe someday in the future software that I give away, which you voluntarily choose to use, may not be to your liking.\n\n> the BTC price has dropped\n\nHah. It\'s not so-- but I guess I should thank you for the flattery there.  I suggest you recalibrate your tea leaves however. :)\n\n[Re: trilli0nn]\n> The interests of [X] and [Y] are not fully aligned\n\nThis is a universal truth where X is not exactly the same as Y.\n\nAs such... it doesn\'t say much. It\'s true for the pairing of single person and their communities or projects, and so on.\n\nWe actively structured things at Blockstream to improve alignment, both in contract terms as well as compensation (employees receive timelocked bitcoin as part of their compensation), as a result my interests are arguably somewhat better aligned with those of other people who own Bitcoins than they would be absent the existence of the company. It seems almost certain that Blockstream\'s interests are better aligned with Bitcoin than, say, btcdraks.  If there is any particular area of specifically concerning misalignment that you aware of. feel free to let me know. \n\n': 12, 'How about stop labeling/negating messengers, and focus on the message?\n\nI\'d give anything if Bitcoin becomes the force it was meant to be, but it seems like too many people who have no interest in privacy & freedom are involved with it.  One could argue that "bitcoiners" are people who still strive for the principles it was founded on, and "altcoiners" are people who don\'t give a shit about them.  I\'m not suggesting we label people in any sort of way, though.  Let\'s focus on the content, and not worry so much about being collectivists.\n\nGod damn, a decentralized reddit alternative can\'t come fast enough!!': 2, 'nullc thanks for your replies. FWIW I never implied or certainly never meant to if it was perceived as such, to suggest you are anything but an asset to the bitcoin core development team. Clearly you know your stuff and are one of the most experienced the field and I respect you considerably for your achievements. This has never been an issue for me, ever. I want to say this quite categorically if it\'s not clear. I also have nothing but awe for many of the other devs too, like sipa and wladamir and I appreciate how . They have always been very kind and generous.\n\nI dont want to drag this out any more but there were a couple of things I would like to answer just for the record.\n\n> Finally, you have not and cannot point to any instance where there was misbehavior\n\nI never said there was misbehaviour, just concerns about what could be which I already voiced and you have given your answers.\n\n> It\'s funny to hear you say this when you\'ve spent so much time attacking my motivations!\n\nI didnt attack your motivations. This is a misunderstanding: maybe I am not articulate enough or maybe something lost in translation: I asked a simple question about company influence and I think you have given a detailed reply. Thank you.\n\n> I do not fault you for not supporting Bitcoin.\n\nI do support bitcoin core development and several bitcoin and non-bitcoin projects: including code, peer review, testing, support, and funding. I don\'t feel compelled to spell it out in detail simply because I have nothing to prove by doing so: it\'s not relevant to be qualified to ask questions or not. 99% of people on r/bitcoin are not contributing anything either, they are just fans, like to discuss and maybe hold some coins. They all have a right to ask questions too.\n\n>  and you\'re distributing it without any attribution\n\nThis is not correct. Take a look at the repository. All credits are there in source, including in the binaries. I don\'t expect you have looked at the binaries but all the [credits are there too in the UI](http://i.imgur.com/gjk7S3R.png) as a quick example.  I take licensing and attribution very seriously and I do not believe in NIH.\n\n> how you reconcile your position with your apparent exclusive control over viacoin\n\nSorry I may have missed this question before. I don\'t have exclusive control, it\'s an open source project. There are 4 people with commit access to viacoin and the other projects. Remember Github Teams are private by default for new participant and individuals needs to change their settings for each team specifically. That\'s why they dont show on the github.com/viacoin organisation screen.\n\nOK\n\nso to round off, thank you for your replies. I am sorry this gave you an unpleasant Sunday but look at it positively, you have some material you can construct into a FAQ should someone else ask again.\n\nFor the record I am not convinced about some of the technical merits of the blockstream project other parts I find fascinating and I am open to new ideas and viewpoints. I would like to think if I ask questions about something else we can forgo any conspiracies about "conflicts of interests", in fact, this illustrates my point quite nicely. You have suggested because I have a "rival project" I cannot be asking questions without some ulterior motive. hold that thought and apply the same rationale as to why I asked about commercial conflicts of interest in core development. From my side I can say in good faith, viacoin isnt a conflict for me to question bitcoin governance. Your message today is you act in good faith that there wont be conflict between blockstream and bitcoin core development. If either one of those statements is acceptable, the other has to be. If either one is objectionable, then the other is also in question and this will always be in the eye of the beholder.\n\nnullc, thank you again for taking the time to answer and I hope the way forward is full of roses and no thorns! :)': 2, "It's there in black and white, Blockstream want to implement SPV proofs that can be managed on the protocol level, (sidechains) this changes the incentive structure that makes Bitcoin. \n\nProponents of sidechains say it makes it better, but no economic implication studies have been done and 3 of the most vocal Blockstream employees have told me there is no need and no president to even warrant considering such a study let alone having it peer reviewed.\n\nNo proof exist that side chains are good for Bitcoin, the counter argument is it's open so it's fair.\n\nOpponents say changes to the incentives in Bitcoin allowed by sidechans will destroy it as block rewards diminish and corrupt the security inherent in the protocol today.

You haven\'t actually answered how this is not a problem \n\nWhat is the specific question there?  You just described what the question is "about" but not the specific question.\n\nI\'ve made an effort to extract actual specific questions and answer them, however.\n\nPossible question 1.  Does Blockstream actually have control over the Bitcoin Core open source project?\n\nNo. Blockstream employes only 2 of 5 committers. The commiters (not just me- which I\'ve specifically pointed out to you on Reddit, so I do not understand why you think you can get away with continually misconstruing it) have severance agreement which allow them to leave blockstream and continue to get paid if blockstream behaves unethically or tries to influence their actions. Blockstream\'s employees are responsible for only about a third of commits or lines of code changed.\n\nEven if it was some majority of contributions something like that, as an open source project there isn\'t much in the way of definitive control beyond who has commit access to the most popular repositories.\n\nMorever, the standard blockstream employment agreement for all employes disclaims property rights on Bitcoin Core, employees work on those projects remains their own. Employees work on their own time unrelated to their own company remains their own.\n\nFinally, you have not and cannot point to any instance where there was misbehavior. Part of the reason for this is that there is little to no mechanism for misbehavior to have occurred.\n\n[All of this I am repeating from my responses to you in the linked thread. But you\'ve failed to point out specifically how this fails to answer your questions.]\n\nPossible question 2. But there is a bunch of work being done, isn\'t that concerning?\n\nWhy would it be? Much of it is work that just wouldn\'t get done if people didn\'t have the time to do it.  Also, we all collaborated before their was a company.   Everyone has their own pet interests, the fact that we have a publicly known about company makes some of those interests more transparent.  Do you think things were better off when you had no idea how these peoples work on Bitcoin core fit into the rest of their lives?\n\nPossible question 3.  In spite of the lack of actual control, are Blockstream\'s interests aligned with the holders of the Bitcoin currency?\n\nI believe so, and have attempted to assure that its so. Our largest investors are all substantial holders of Bitcoin, our incentivize compensation plan uses timelocked Bitcoins. It\'s my goal that everyone at Blockstream will benefit if Bitcoin goes up in value, and lose if it goes down.  Our company mission is complement to the ethos embodied in the design of Bitcoin.  Our founders are primarily long time Bitcoin contributors and advocates, and many of us are long time cypherpunks whos work and advocacy has been supporting these ideals for decades; who specifically created blockstream to help advance infrastructure work in this ecosystem.\n\nAll that aside, change is always possible, which is why we structured things to minimize harm even if the company or its employees turn evil in the future.\n\nPossible question 4.  If {someone} did actually have control over the Bitcoin Core open source project and did something people did not like what would that mean?\n\nBitcoin Core is under a very permissive license. This is an intentional decision that has an incredibly high cost to the Bitcoin community because it means that our own efforts are exploited by the authors of competing systems, but it provides an absolute protection against abuse by the authors of any project.\n\nNo one uses Bitcoin Core except through voluntary action. No monopoly rights, patents, trademarks, trade secrets, or copyright power is used or can be used to prevent people from maintaining, using, or sharing their own modified versions or completely novel copies of the software. The protection provided here is absolute and exists completely independently of any (lack of) trustworthyness of the participants in the future.\n\nThe only thing we have left to deny to you or the public is our free labor, unless you sought to deny us our own free will and freedom to associate no stronger promise could be provided.\n\nNo project can be independent of its participants; but we can make sure the users are independent of the project and have done so through the use of free software.\n\n>  It doesnt really matter what the motivation of contributors is or isnt, if it advances the project, fixes bugs and improves testing, it\'s a win\n\nIt\'s funny to hear you say this when you\'ve spent so much time attacking my motivations!  How can you reconcile this dissonance with everything else you\'re saying? It\'s just short of astonishing to hear you say this a moment after spending so much time attacking my motivations.\n\nIn your case-- I was pointing out near total _lack_ of contributions. There is no win. Not as an attack, as I said, I do not fault you for not supporting Bitcoin. But I do fault you for being deceptive about where you stand and what motivates your approach towards me.\n\n> asked what the issues you thought were, you say you dont know, \n\nThis is misleading.  I said I don\'t know where the actual bug is, or I would have fixed it. But if you dump the utxo set and then check it against the index on a node which has been running for some days some addresses will just not show up in the index; it\'s trivially demonstrated. If I had to tender a guess, there is probably some problem handling reorganizations or hash collisions (maybe a combination). I explained this to you in IRC.\n\nI know it has issues, I know how to reproduce them. I don\'t care to put in the work to fix it because it\'s not part of software I am maintaining. We\'re already maintaining your software for you, but we\'re not going to go out of our way to do more of it. Making sure your own software is correct and tested software is your own responsibility; don\'t think you can pin that on us, we already do enough free labor for you.\n\n> And yes, I also use it in my altcoin, why is this a problem?\n\nIt\'s not a problem; but you\'re taking code someone else wrote, that someone else has updated, and claiming it as a "contribution" when in fact all you\'ve done is used it for builds of an altcoin; and you\'re distributing it without any attribution (there is no mention that the work is by other people in any of the places you\'ve written about it or in the binaries you\'re distributing, and you out right claimed it as your own here on reddit) to the people who did the work. You haven\'t written a line of code, AFAICT. I think it\'s misleading to cite this as a contribution to the Bitcon ecosystem. It\'s not-- at most it\'s a contribution to your altcoin work, which is fine... but it does nothing to counter the complete lack of evidence that your interest in communicating with me is from anything but obstructing progress in the bitcoin ecosystem for the betterment of your competing systems.\n\n> Is your anger towards me really justified?\n\nI\'m not angry.  But you\'re failing to ask specific questions while continually accusing me of not answering, while also failing to answer the questions I\'ve asked you in return (ones which were straight forward enough that they could be answered as yes/no; including things like how you reconcile your position with your apparent exclusive control over viacoin). It is wasting a considerable amount of my time and energy; which I\'m trying to economize on.\n\n> I am not out to upset anyone, lest not you\n\nGenerally when you accuse someone of unethical behavior and when you claim that they\'re unresponsive or (somehow) not permitting you to ask them reasonable questions; while simultaneously they\'re making a considerable effort to answer, even trying to infer specific questions where you\'ve failed to actually ask them... most people would find that upsetting.  It\'s not really upsetting to me-- a little offensive perhaps, I\'m used to the bad behavior in this space, but perhaps the fact that it probably why you expect it to be upsetting.\n\nBelieve me, if you were actually successful in upsetting me, you\'d know it. :)\n': 3, 'What "core issues" specifically have I not answered?  I\'ve repeatedly asked you to be specific, but all I\'ve received in return is a slap in the face from your furious arm-waving.\n\nIn the absence of any specific question, or incident where you allege something wrong has happened to go off of, I\'ve done my best and responded at great length and care about the general reasons about controls about the problems of the general sort which might be concerning you (or a hypothetical person with earnest concerns).
