I think that the risks of that are unacceptable, and when things go wrong the PR disaster is much worse than announcing the change and requiring clients to upgrade.  See the BIP66 fork.\n\nAs for (a) or (b), I think that a hard fork should avoid them at all costs; and the measure against (a) should prevent "bad samaritans" like Mircea from re-issuing other people\'s transactions for a different branch.

That is, so long as they comply with industry guidelines about ratios of debt to credit, asset reserves etc.  When they lend somebody money, it creates a debt, which be accounted for as an asset (somebody owes you something), which can be collateralized, which then improves the asset/liability ratio, which means they can have more money created by their reserve bank for them.\n\nAnd that\'s what it is all really about these days.

I already mentioned other problems with routers and STBs.\n\nI'm not sure there's anything presumptuous about the maths. Mining makes almost no economic sense to any domestic user because it will invariably cost more in electricity than the mined coins. Buying coins makes far more sense in the vast majority of cases.\n\nIf 21 (or anyone else; I certainly have no axe to grind with 21) take any revenue from mining they're making the economic case far worse from the end user's perspective, while at the same time acting as a point of centralization in the network (as any large pool does). If they're not doing revenue sharing then they have cost, thermal, etc problems (typically multiply BoM costs by 2.5x to work out the incremental retail cost). Why will an average consumer pay for mining as a feature? Why would manufacturers add it and risk being more expensive, plus having to deal with increased support costs?\n\nMining is a zero sum game; everyone can't win. Much better that people who care, and make conscious informed choices about the pros and cons, do so.\n\nAs for Wi-Fi, there is a huge difference between an Enterprise grade Aruba device that an domestic AP. The team at Aruba (and others) do phenomenal amounts of stress testing and their entire value proposition is based on maximizing the ability to connect devices as well as possible; low cost designs don't do this. They are designed to fixed costs by engineers who don't have the time or facilities to do large scale testing. Some work very well: I have a Netgear AP that happily handles 30+ devices and never misses a beat; it replaces one I won't name (but which has shipped in the millions) that starts dropping devices as soon as device number 15 comes online). In 10 years of working with Wi-Fi I ran across far more bad APs than good ones.": 1, "The largest reason is because non-former X's can't openly talk about a lot of the type of things we talk about here because it hurts their employer's competitive advantage.": 2, "No real issue, just noticed that a lot of headlines go 'former X says Y'.": 3, '>\xe2\x80\x9cI used to work in Wi-Fi design, and there\xe2\x80\x99s an awful lot of Wi-Fi access points out there that will fall over if you put too many clients on them.

Well, your refrigerator is usually somewhere inaccessible. It probably doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have great Wi-Fi coverage either.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nThis whole paragraph makes very little sense. A low-end AP can easily handle 20-50 devices... high end APs handle 1000s. Who\'s fridge isn\'t within Wi-FI coverage?

Since May 2015, the police is investigating the incident at Jumbo supermarkets in Groningen and Zwolle where an explosive is used. The actions of the perpetrator have only resulted in material damage, there are no victims.\n\nThe identity of the perpetrator is not known to the police. The police and the prosecution do, together with Jumbo, anything to avoid another incident. We therefore appeal to you. Helps you figure out the identity of the perpetrator?\n\nWe invite you to join us think especially in the research. It may be that you have information about the Jumbo incident and / or the offender. Perhaps you recognize the combination of items that we call in this case? Or have you seen something for the investigation. Please let us know!\n\nThis file tells you what we have done so far as police. We also share specific information that has emerged during the investigation. Because of the investigative interest we publish all the details at this stage. Some information would only know the perpetrator.

After this, the reactions, where possible, added to this file.\n\nFor readability we speak in the file 'he' and 'perpetrator'. However, it is impossible to state with certainty that the perpetrator is a man, but we love strongly into account.

This substance is in a safe place defused by the Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD). The police are doing a neighborhood and passers-examination, but this does not lead to the identity of the perpetrator.\n\nThe study shows that such white buckets are used in the hospitality industry. The bucket is also a white kitchen timer.

It is not immediately clear what happened.\n\nLocation explosive OverwinningspleinEen few days later, from camera images that something has been detonated. As a result, damage to a window and door frame arise. During the investigation the police will include some fragments of a timer to gray.

But there isn\'t much that pool can do.   They can censor transactions, sure -- but those mining there will soon learn of the censoring and the pool loses share.  The problem resolves itself.\n\nIf the pool wants to be able to double spend their own transactions by employing that hashing capacity for performing a 51% attack, that pool would then need to take the hashing offline and mine a private fork.  Again, those mining with that pool will soon see no more earnings with that pool, and switch to another pool that isn\'t "so unlucky".   That causes the offending pool to lose share.  So once again, the problem likely resolves itself.\n\nThe concern is with the manufacturers mining for their own benefit.  Like KNCMiner with their 16nm "3D" chips.   If their numbers are correct, they could amass enough hardware from their own production and mine a private fork such that they have more than 100% of all existing mining capacity -- allowing them to perform a 51% attack without anyone knowing until they broadcast the first block with the double spends.  This broadcast then causes a block reorg with the end result being that some previously-confirmed transactions essentially "disappear".\n\nThat\'s a risk.  I don\'t know if it is "easy" for them to do this as it would require likely tens of millions of dollars worth of their hardware production.    And they likely couldn\'t do large amounts of double spending without anyone figuring out who was behind it.\n\nWhat will likely equal things out is KNCMiner won\'t be the only manufacturer with hardware that performs in the same ballpark as their 16NM "3D", which will increase hashing capacity once that new hardware starts getting sold, which in turn makes the cost of the attack I described being available to KNCMiner to end up being even higher.

If he polls other miners, he will usually get that header with a delay that is independent of the block size. (The miner who solves a block wants the other miners to get that information as soon as possible, to secure his catch.  In fact, if he is an open pool, he will provide the hash of B(N) via Stratum.)

What big blocks will do is increase the frequency of empty blocks.

This can allow payment channels to be open for unlimited amounts of time for example.\n\nI would like to stress that these opcodes are quite independent of Lightning Network and payment channel, but are a good example of what kind of things they empower. We\'ve already seen some exciting payment channel implementations like Stremium, but with these opcodes, we can begin to see vastly more advanced use-cases. \n\nIn terms of how long it takes to get this stuff into Bitcoin?
