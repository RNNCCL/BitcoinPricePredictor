EPA\nHundreds of banks are jumping on the mobile payments bandwagon \xe2\x80\x93 via Apple. Our colleague Robin Sidel wrote that debit-card and credit-card companies are getting on board \xe2\x80\x9choping to keep a tight grip on customers\xe2\x80\x9d who might scamper off if they find their cards incompatible with Apple\xe2\x80\x99s system. Meanwhile, Alipay, the payments company that processes many of Alibaba\xe2\x80\x99s transactions and a pretty big company in its own right, signed up its 190 millionth user, its 190 millionth active user. That\xe2\x80\x99s up from 100 million in late 2013.\n\n>Both of these services have something in common: They are both tied into existing platforms that people already use and are comfortable with. Beyond these two companies, WeChat has 440 million active users, and Line has 170 million active users. Both of these companies offer mobile payments. Compare that to bitcoin and its 10 million some-odd wallets, of which we don\xe2\x80\x99t exactly know how many are active.\n\n>Marc Andreessen, the VC who in another life created Netscape Navigator and is a big bitcoin backer, acknowledged Apple Pay\xe2\x80\x99s potential, but is betting that over the long run, bitcoin will have the bigger impact. Bitcoin, he said at a California conference, \xe2\x80\x9cwill actually have a big impact over 20 years, but Apple Pay is the thing that\xe2\x80\x99s going to have a big impact in the next three years. And the combination of those two is going to cause enormous change.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n>This isn\xe2\x80\x99t really about the pros and cons of one system over the other, or the distinction between a platform and a currency. Bitcoin offers some features the others don\xe2\x80\x99t. But most people don\xe2\x80\x99t care about the kinds of libertarian ideals that permeate bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s core or banks creaming fees off the top. They just want a product that works.\n\n>The reality is that there are competing products out there that already have large, active, installed user bases. Sure, Apple Pay could bring mobile payments to a new crowd, which could later reach out on its own to bitcoin, and Apple could add bitcoin to its wallet. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not a given that people will jump from Apple to bitcoin, or that Apple will feel compelled to add bitcoin.\n\n>In other words, Coinbase and Blockchain and Circle are not competing with just each other for customers. They are competing with Apple and Alipay and WeChat, too. The market for mobile, digital payments is already crowded.

The "mining" process is really just the computer validating or backing up other transactions from around the world locally, on your personal computer, and making those available to other computers who in turn validate the authenticity of those transactions? Like if I told several people I bought a $1 candy bar and they told a bunch of other people as well, so that if someone comes in and says I didn\'t that there would be enough people who knew that I did to show that he is lying?\n\nThanks for the BC! How do I claim this?': 1, "Coin is a 3rd party app(not official) \nThe only real downside to these apps are if they store your private keys they then can control your coins.\n\nMining doesn't effect the price persay, but when people dump the coins they mine it does. We have to mine because if we didn't there is no company to mine for us. And if there was a company mining everything for us then they would have complete rule over all transactions.\n\nYour address is listed as well as the address you are sending to. There are ways to remain anonymous if you wish too, but if you are not trying to his your identity you could be found out decently easily assuming whoever is digging has cooperation of exchanges or services. Did you enter your name anywhere in coin? If not they won't know who you are, unless you sent coins from coinbase or an exchange linked to you, but even then coin probably won't track you. \n\nSomeone else can go in depth on why open source is good, but it's open sourced with a voting system, so if a bad player wants to release something that will screw the network no one will install that update meaning that is a vote against that update. ": 1, '1-  I have never heard of the app you are talking about.  Could you provide some information and links?  Whatever you are talking about, there is no such thing as an "official" Bitcoin app, since Bitcoin isn\'t a company or institution.  I would be very very wary of anything claiming to be an "official" Bitcoin anything, sounds like a scam.\n\n2-  I still don\'t know what Coin is, you\'ll have to clear that up.  Some people store their Bitcoin with third parties like Coinbase, but this is generally not recommended as it is a security risk (a la Mt Gox) and against the principles of Bitcoin.\n\n3-  Mining is like Bitcoin\'s transaction servers.  PayPal and banks spend millions on building, securing, updating and storing server farms to verify transactions and keep their networks up to date.  Miners are the Bitcoin equivalent of that, except no one is in control of all of the servers, and they are paid from new coins being created and transaction fees instead of by the profits of the bank or PayPal.\n\nIf there weren\'t many miners, someone with a bigger server farm could just plug into the network (because it is open to anyone), and start deciding who could send to who.  They can\'t, because the network is too specialised and big.  This is a good thing because the whole point of Bitcoin is that noone is in charge except the users.\n\n4-  No other information is attached to a transaction on the blockchain (except for an optional message or extra data), but may be attached to it in someone else\'s records.  Again, I don\'t know who Coin are but when you buy something off someone else if you tell them your email address or shipping location while you pay them then obviously that party knows that that information is associated with your Bitcoin address.  What they do with that information is up to them.  Some Bitcoin services promise to destroy or not store that information to help preserve anonymity, but you\'re trusting that company is doing what they say.  \n\n5-  Imagine Bitcoin is like a bank vault box with a lock on it.  Imagine your money is a gold bar sitting inside that vault box.\n\nThe Bitcoin vault box is made of glass and is completely see through.  In addition, the blueprints for the construction and security mechanisms of the box are available on the internet for anyone who wants to steal the gold bar to inspect in full.\n\nMillions of people have their gold stored in the box, and all of the best vault crackers have tried to steal it with all the information about the security of the box they could ever ask for, but the gold is still in the box.  If there are any security problems, of which there doesn\'t seem to be, no one knows about them or the gold would have already left the box.\n\nConclusion: Hopefully that helps, if you have any questions, feel free to ask.  \n\nBonus:  You can now own a small amount of Bitcoin yourself!\n\n500 bits /u/changetip': 1, 'The Bitcoin tip for 500 bits ($0.17) has been collected by *aesamattki*.\n\n\n[ChangeTip info](https://www.changetip.com/tip-online/reddit) | [ChangeTip video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AnfKpypMNw) | /r/Bitcoin': 1, "A Bitcoin Wallet address is a public string of 30+ characters, normally starting with a '1'.\n\nIf you login at Circle, you can click on 'Request Money' and it will give you an address (just leave the amount and message blank).
