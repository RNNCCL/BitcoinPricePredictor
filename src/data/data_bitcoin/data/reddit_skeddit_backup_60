Therefore, Bitcoin can be used as an effective store of value, as an alternative to fiat currency and gold... though currently an extremely volatile one. If Bitcoin is still running smoothly in 10+ years and the world loses confidence in the US dollar (due to massive monetary inflation, etc.), it seems plausible to me that Bitcoin could even become the reserve currency of the world.\n\nAlso, while the technology isn\'t there yet, in a few years Bitcoin transactions could be as cheap and easy as credit card transactions. You\'d use your smartphone to scan a QR code or receive NFC data, and in seconds your payment would be done (using some payment channel system). This has huge advantages for merchants because:\n\n* There are no barriers. You don\'t have to sign any agreements, and "being your own bank" provides a ton of flexibility.\n* Transactions aren\'t censored.\n* With payment channels, fees will likely be far lower than credit cards.\n* Transactions are irreversible.\n\nConsumers would often not have much incentive to use Bitcoin at point-of-sale, so merchants would probably have to pass on some of Bitcoin\'s benefits in the form of discounts to see much Bitcoin adoption.\n\nThere are many use-cases where the above advantages are important enough to make even today\'s very-inefficient Bitcoin transaction system highly competitive with other transaction systems. This is why the Bitcoin economy has way more than just speculation and hodling.\n\n(Note that almost all of the above advantages are only possible due to Bitcoin\'s decentralization.)\n\nIt *may* be the case that expecting people to not lose their bitcoins is too optimistic. If Bitcoin\'s main sticking-point is security, then a lot of people could use insured Bitcoin banks, and a reversible transaction layer could be built on top of Bitcoin. These things would remain optional, and since they\'re built on top of a secure, programmable, decentralized, irreversible currency, these higher layers could still be far more secure than the fiat banking system. But I\'m hopeful that sufficient security can be achieved while maintaining essentially all of Bitcoin\'s decentralization, even for typical end-users -- dedicated Bitcoin hardware on both the merchant and consumer ends will be important for this, I think.\n\nThese are all long goals which we will incrementally move toward. Right now, it\'s true that there is only a small section of the overall world economy that would benefit from Bitcoin\'s current advantages. But Bitcoin will get better and more useful over time.

Thus, more and more people will underreport their income because of the decreased costs in doing so, while the tax authority's costs will increase because of the effort it takes to get people to pay. Right now the IRS costs the federal government $11 billion/year, but collects over $3 *trillion*/year in revenue. As revenues fall and costs go up, however, there will reach a point where the IRS is no longer profitable, probably a good while after cryptocurrencies become more popular than fiat.
