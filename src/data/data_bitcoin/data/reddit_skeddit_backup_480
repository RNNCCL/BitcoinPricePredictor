My comment is re-entered below.': 2, '1. Bitcoin mining is a for-profit proposition, and the "difficulty" adjusts to ensure that there is a profit motive to mine. Nevertheless, anyone can mine that wants to, so that keeps the profit very low. Also, there are conditions that favor certain miners (places with cheap electricity and cooling like Iceland, and super-powerful chips called ASICs only available to certain firms), and so it is not profitable for the "hobbyist".\n2. Bitcoin certainly makes some illegal (and BAD) activities easier. Currently, there is a virus called Cryptolocker that encrypts your files and demands a bitcoin ransom. Such a thing would not be possible with Visa or MasterCard. But any revolutionary idea comes with problems. For the internet, it is identity theft and child pornography, among others. For email, it is spam and viruses. But no one labels these ideas as bad because of the new problems they introduce. We just have to learn how to deal with them.\n3. Hard to list them all! Foremost in my mind is the fact that financial transactions can be performed between complete strangers, without divulging personal information or trusting the other party or a third party (Visa/Mastercard/bank). Hacks on merchants (Target, Home Depot) would not be possible if the merchant had no personal information.\nSecond, bitcoin transactions are called "push", because the customer initiates the transaction, not the merchant. Credit card transactions are "pull", wherein the merchant is given your credit card, and "pulls" the money from your account. The only thing stopping the merchant from "pulling" any more money is your vigilant checking of your billing statement and the CC company\'s fraud abatement efforts. But nothing stops the merchant from recording your name and CC number to sell to criminals.\nThird, transactions are final and cannot be reversed by the sender or a third party such as a bank or any government.\nFourth, any amount of funds can be sent anywhere in the world, even across borders, almost instantly, and almost for free ($1 million worth could be sent for ten cents).\nThere are many other advantages, but you\'ll have to do more research to list them all!\n4. Bitcoin is a new idea, and no one can say if some killer problem will be found (but as time passes, that possibility diminishes). Don\'t bet you entire life on its success. Nevertheless, if it fails, you\'ll only lose 100% of your investment. If it succeeds, THE SKY IS THE LIMIT (I am not a financial adviser).\n5. Don\'t know what that means.\n6. Anyone can track Bitcoin\'s financial transactions--anyone running a Bitcoin node has every transaction that ever occurred on his computer. But those transactions are not directly tied to a personal identity (that\'s why Cryptolocker uses bitcoin, successfully so far). Nevertheless, techniques exist for correlating transactions to individual behavior, so the connection can be made unless the person is VERY careful (that\'s why Silk Road went down). Many young people are unaware that their social interactions on the internet provide enough metadata for Google to have a complete profile of virtually everyone\'s behavior (and the NSA has been shown to have taps into Google\'s data).\n7. Most us bitcoiners would like to see Bitcoin handled the way the internet was: almost no governmental regulation. That would create fertile ground for innovation. But some look for *more* regulation, thus opening bitcoin up to use by established Wall Street financial institutions.\n\nI wish you success on your paper!\n': 3, "1. No, not at the moemnt.\n\n2. No.  Bitcoin hasn't created these markets, they existed well before Bitcoin and will continue to exist with or without bitcoin.  Actually other cryptocurrencies are better suited for illicit purposes as bitcoin is actually quite transparent on transactions.\n\n3. It's transferable instantaneously, irrefutable, global usage, with virtually no fees.  It's the first digital asset people can own without a 3rd party being involved and the asset can't be copied or created out of thin air.  The supply is globally known, predictable and finite at just under 21,000,000.00000000 units.  Anyone can now make programs to interact with real money without needing to rely on a bank or 3rd party.\n\n\n4. Yes, large transactions such as a recent gov sending $14,000,000+ in seconds with paying $0.04 in fees is an example of this.\n\n\n5. Right now it's main use is in exchange (i.e. you buy/sell the bitcoins almost instantly and thereby ignoring any volatility).  There is a lot of speculation the growing userbase will continue as it is... more demand, less supply means the value will appreciate even though they are currently experiencing 11% inflation due to the mining rewards of 25BTC every 10 minutes.\n\n6. You don't need to be a three letter organization to track bitcoin transactions live as they happen, here's a screensaver that shows them live if you'd really like. www.gatherhelp.com/tests/matrix   (You read the transaction from the top being the amount followed by the address it is sent to).\n\n\n7. Time will tell but given it's a global phenomena regulation will likely only be there to help it's nation's citizens in knowing what is a reputable entity and controlling the on/off ramps to local fiat currencies.  Attempts to suppress or stifle digital currencies via regulation merely put that country at a disadvantage globally since pioneering businesses will be based in the more welcoming countries thereby becoming the market leaders for the new services it brings.\n": 2, "1. Mining is basically not profitable for most people at this point, basically unless you have a large sum of money and a hookup on mining equipment. This could change depending on mining difficulty (basically amount of people mining) and the price. As for an investment profitability is based on supply and demand but with there being only 21 million bitcoin in existence there is huge potential upside still.\n\n2. I'm not the most qualified to answer this one but it has helped facilitate this. Bitcoin itself seems to be trying to move into other directions but alternative crypto-currencies will likely fulfill this niche for the foreseeable future.\n\n3. Relative anonymity to prevent your credit card information being stolen when making purchases on a shady website, lower fees than a credit card, store of value (not really related to transactions exactly), and faster than credit card verification. \n\n4. It's just about as safe as you want it to be. If done properly it can be safer than any bank but the problem is that most people are too lazy to go through these precautions, although in their defense this process is not always the most user friendly at this point. It is more than secure enough for large transactions, again done properly, although the market cap is currently only around 4 billion so it depend on your definition of large.\n\n5. The best way to go about this at this point would be to immediately convert your bitcoins into cash through a service such as Bitpay which do it immediately. Even regular cash has some volatility involved and eventually bitcoin may become just as stable if not more stable than these currencies seeing as it could become a world currency. The best metaphor for this is a row boat compared to a tanker in a rough ocean, which the size of the ship referring to the market cap, where a tanker is not fazed by natural waves.\n\n6. Well if you buy bitcoin from most major sites they require a decent amount of information but as you move them to different wallets or use services such as mixers it can become very difficult. There are other methods that one could use here as well but long story short nothing is 100% NSA proof.\n\n7. The answer here of course depends upon why you value bitcoins. One of the toughest things with bitcoin is that it is outside the jurisdiction of any court. They can go after the places where you convert is to and from cash for a specific country but any regulation runs the risk of inhibiting the growth of a potential tremendously advantageous technology while at the same time potentially putting your country at a disadvantageous position with many other countries who have allowed this technology to flourish. I think it could be good to see a little regulation to help people feel more comfortable with this but innovation is so fast at this point that pandora's box can only be taped shut so many times.\n\n\nI am really not an expert by any means and these are just some brief answers through which you could start further research if deemed necessary.

You open your "Bitbill" app on your phone and scan it or simply scan it at a point of sale terminal to accept it. As soon as you do so the amount of the bill will be displayed and ownership of the bill will be transferred to an identifier stored on the scanning device. \n\nThese bills can also be generated from your wallet balance within the app and printed out, or you can chose to invalidate any bill you own and sweep the funds to your wallet. If you try and spend this bill now, the receiving end will recognize it is no longer valid. \n\nThis app could potentially be built on a decentralized platform (possibly a sidechain?) so that there is no third party risk associated. And as you simply print out the bills, you will not have to order them from a centralized company and hope they haven\'t been sweeped by the time you receive them. \n\nAfter writing this all out it kind of seems impractical, why not just send BTC directly to your recipient? Well simply put this saves time. You no longer as a sending party have to pull out your phone to send the coin, and wait for the receiving party to pull theirs out so you can scan their public address and input the amount (and possibly wait for confirmations). This system would make it so the only thing that needs to be done is for the receiving end to scan the bill, and the transaction is done. This system could also facilitate automatic processing of left over change to the previous owner\'s wallet as that information will be stored within the bill. ': 2, 'Trusted entity ?
