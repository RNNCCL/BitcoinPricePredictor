This is ridiculous, this would be a 130GB installation of data alone not including the program.  What a waste of time.  The only logical thing to do at this point is indeed to trash the whole thing and start over with electrum. edit: I selected to import to electrum and it would only take the wallet address; I did not see where or how to enter the private key and which of the privbase58 or privhexbe key to enter, and/or if it needed the priv.....: prefix for the key even if I knew where to enter it.  in any case electrum said "this wallet is watching only this means you will not be able to spend bitcoints with it. make sure you have the seed phrase or private keys  before you request bitcoin to be sent to this wallet."  I have the keys.  opening the electrum client now shows the balance.  thanks for the help! I then created a new wallet in electrum.

One way to clean everything up is to send your BTC to a good mobile wallet (Breadwallet if you have an iPhone) from Electrum, remove Armory and electrum altogether, and then do a fresh install of Electrum and set up a new wallet with a wordlist for backup.\n\nEdit: If you still want to run a full node wallet, I would redownload the Bitcoin client (and you have a choice of 3-4 versions from which to choose), let it sync for a day or two, then download mSigna and use that.

It avoids getting hit, i may only hit the lower bid, the higher bid often "escapes", like it knows that im going to hit lower anyway so he doesnt want to get filled.\n\nbut you can argue also that it should in principle happen both ways that bots adjust bid offers rapidly to moves in other markets. and seriously, BTC before yesterday was very calm, and this sh*t did still happen. so 50% of the time i should have a BETTER fill.

The first one puts the original output data in the signature area of the transaction -- that\'s what Coinbin does (or at least, used to do -- I haven\'t used them in a while).  The second one leaves the signature area completely blank, which is what Bitcoin Core likes.  No matter which place you use to sign it, the final signed transaction will be the same from both -- they just differ in how they like to read unsigned transactions.\n\nFrom your post, it sounds like you are using Bitcoin Core, so use that second one I gave you with the "signrawtransaction" command, and then broadcast the result.  If you need any more help, let me know.': 2, "What happened was that two of the transaction ID's that you used for inputs were not valid transactions.  They didn't exist.  I used the signature data in the transaction you provided to guess what the address was, and went and found other different transaction IDs to replace them with, and when I added up the totals, it was the exact correct amount.  So my guess is that the IDs you provided were *malleated* versions of those transactions, and that transaction malleability created a different transaction ID than you orginally had.  Basically, you just had an invalid transaction ID for them.\n\nIf that is the case, then no the old transactions will never be confirmed because the malleated versions of them in effect negate/double-spend them.  Only one version of a transaction will ever happen.\n\nLuke Jr. said they might be, because we don't know *for sure* that those IDs were actually malleated versions of other transactions.  Since those transaciton IDs don't exist anywhere and can't be looked up, technically it's possible that they were entirely different transactions, unrelated to the ones I found, and it's just a giant coincidence that they happened to be for the same amounts.  And if that was the case, your old transaction could confirm if those transactions who up on the network.\n\nBut I think that's extremely unlikely to be true, and it's far more likely that they were malleated versions of the real confirmed transactions, and that they will never show up and thus your old transaction will never confirm.\n\nEither way, it will definitely not confirm if you send out this new one, because it spends some additional inputs that were correct and valid in your previous transaction, so if this new one goes through, then *those* will become invalidated, and your old one will guaranteed never confirm.\n\nBasically, as soon as this new one goes through, you're finished and definitely don't have to worry about anything else.\n\nBe careful about listening to Luke Jr.  A lot of what he says is technically correct but purposefully confusing, so you will come off more confused than if you just ignored him.  My personal advice is to just always ignore him.  That said, I personally very much dislike him because I think he is intentionally trying to hurt and confuse people, so my opinion of him is of course heavily biased towards that.": 2, 'Error code 22 means the transaction is rejected, meaning that it is invalid for some reason.  It\'s not frozen or stuck, it will never go through, because it\'s not valid.\n\nCan you post the actual raw transaction?  (A lot of hex beginning with 01000000, the result of the "getrawtransaction" part of Solution B.)': 2, 'Ok, it looks like you already have all the private keys, and that error code and what you\'ve already said makes me think you definitely do.  So most likely, what is preventing the transaction signing and all your other problems is that your wallet still thinks those old malleated transactions are real, and it doesn\'t know how to deal with the fact that they conflict with the real ones in the blockchain.  So, there\'s a few things to do to fix that.  First, make sure your Bitcoin software is up to date.  Are you running Bitcoin Core 0.11.X or 0.12.X?  (X can be any number.)  If you are, close it down, and then you\'ll need to edit the short cut to it in order to add a command line option.  So right now the shortcut to it will read something like this (but maybe not exactly):\n\n    "C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe"\n\nand you want to add the "zapwallettxes" options, so edit the shortcut path so it looks like this:\n\n    "C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe" -zapwallettxes\n\nwith a space after the last quote there.  Alternatively, you can run that whole command from the Run window.\n\nWhat that will do is run the Bitcoin software but it will clean out all the transactions from your wallet file.  So run it and wait a few minutes or until it tells you it\'s finished.  (I don\'t know how it works, I\'ve never used the command.  It might be near instant or it might take a little bit.)\n\nAfter you do that, you\'re going to need to edit the shortcut again (or run it from the Run window), but with a different command.  This time you\'ll need to run:\n\n    "C:\\Program Files\\Bitcoin\\bitcoin-qt.exe" -rescan\n\nThat will take a few hours probably.  The Bitcoin application will open but the bottom sync bar will restart from the beginning.  It won\'t take as long as the initial download did, because it\'s just scanning all the blocks, not redownloading and verifying them.  But what it\'s doing is rescanning every block to see if there\'s any transactions relevant to your wallet.  And since you just cleared it out with that zap command, there will be no conflicts or problems.\n\nOnce that\'s finished, THEN your wallet will be up to date and accurate, and you can spend the money in it however you want.  You can just make a new transaction to send to the localbitcoins account, or you can sign that previous one that I made for you.  And this time there shouldn\'t be any problems signing it, because your wallet doesn\'t have the wrong transaction ID\'s.\n\nSo now that we\'ve solved it, here\'s what I think happened.  I think some of the people who sent you the money you were trying to spend were using an old version of Bitcoin that created what\'s called a "high S value" transaction, and then when they broadcast it, most nodes rejected it because of that glitch.  However, your wallet kept it because it paid you and it wanted to make sure the transaction didn\'t get lost.  Now, it\'s possible -- even without the private keys -- to fix the transaction, and some people have bots that do that automatically and re-send them out to the Bitcoin network.  I think somebody did that to those "high S value" transactions, which created a new and different transaciton ID, even though the transaction itself was identical in every way that matters.  So the money your wallet thought you had was still there, just with a different transaction ID than your wallet thought.  So when you tried to spend that money, your wallet created the transaction using the wrong ID\'s for those previous transactions.  (When you send money in Bitcoin, you have to reference money that was previously sent to you, in order to prove that you own and can spend that money.)  And your wallet never discarded those transactions and ignored the valid ones because the valid ones conflicted with the ones it had for you.  So by zapping out all the ones it stored and then rescanning the blockchain, we\'ve got your wallet in sync with the actual real transactions.\n\nDid that make sense?': 1, 'Why wouldn\'t I already have those private keys? Now when I tried listaddressgroupings, I\'m getting nothing.\n\nupdate: ok, restarting got listaddressgroupings to work. I wanted to see if those input addresses were ones I used before. Then I used dumpprivkey to look up the keys for those addresses and then importprivkey. However, then I got "Error adding key to wallet (code -4)" for all 5 of them.': 1, 'rawtransaction:\n\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': 1, "> he is trying to derail bitcoin.\n\nWait, what?
