And it's essentially impossible to doublespend an online purchases- you order something from Overstock and then succesfully respend those coins, overstock will see that your transaction didn't confirm and not ship your order. \n\nOnce Bitcoin has more of a presence in retail environments, I'd expect to see android apps specifically built to attempt doublespends\n\nYou'd set up your app with the address you want your coins sent to, set whether the app should attempty it's double spend automatically after X seconds or wait for user interaction. Lastly, it would need to have a relatively large list of Bitcoin nodes loaded regularly. \n\nUser would go to the tiger direct store, make a purchase and broadcast it to a single node with a 0.0005 transaction fee. Tigerdirects computer notes an unconfirmed transaction to the address they supplied you with and says you're good. A second later you press the doublespend button, and your phone broadcasts a new transaction to 160 nodes, spending the same exact coins you sent to tigerdirect to the second address which is under your control, along with a 0.1 btc transaction fee (just to be extreme)\n\nNothkngs ever 100%, but you'd have two potential end results. Either you receive the product you purchased and the bitcoins you used have successfully been transferred to tiger direct OR you leave the store with your $500 product, and the mining pools opt to include the transaction you sent to yourself, on account of the vastly larger transaction fee you included. You leave the store with your $500 product and have only spend $37.00 for it. \n\nUnless someone cares to explain why this wouldn't work, I'll go ahead believing that the lack of successful doublespends is not due to the impossibility of conducting one, it's due to the dearth of opportunities to actually pull one off. Once more retailers start accepting Bitcoin at the register, someone will certainly build a tool like the one I explained or figure out a better approach.\n\nThat's how I see things at least.

If there is then waiting an extended amount of confirmations may apply for miners, otherwise one confirmation is pretty fine.\n\nMiners can only potentially double-spend *their own bitcoins*': 2, 'Could starbucks accept no confirmations? Could you send a transaction, they see that the transaction has propagated through the network with no confirmations and still give you your coffee? Nobody wants to wait around for confirmations. But really, a coffee? Could you really scam them?': 2, 'The miner\'s coins are created by a special "coinbase" transaction in each block, so it is easy to tell whether some coins are freshly mined.  (Nothing to do with Coinbase the company - terrible name...)\n\nAlready in the current protocol, freshly-mined coins can only be moved after 100 confirmations or so.\n\nMiners can choose which transactions to include in a block, and they do not have to be in chrono order.  Suppose a guy pays for a purchase with some coins (transaction A), then a few seconds later he issues another order to move those same coins to another address (transaction B).  A miner (even innocently) may include transaction B instead of A in his candidate block, and if he happens to solve the block before other miners, transaction B is confirmed and A gets rejected.  \n\nThe merchant can guard against this risk by waiting for at least one confirmation.  (f it has enough resources, it could also check that enough miners are already at work on blocks with transaction A. See the comment about Bitpay in this same topic.)': 1, 'That is what I wrote.': 1, 'Yes. This is actually what Bitpay does.

There is a small chance (about 1 in 100) that the first block that confirms a transaction will be superseded by an alternate block and become "orphan".  Within that 1% chance, there is some risk that the alternate block will not include the "confirmed" transaction, and will instead include a transaction that sends the same coins to a different address.  The first transaction then would be canceled as an attempted double-spend.  The risk is small, but a gang with resources could perhaps manipulate the network delays to increase it to exploitable levels.\n\nThe average waiting time for 1 confirmation should be 10 minutes, but has been somewhat less recently.  However, the delay it is a random variable with a long tail, meaning that delays of 20-30 minutes or more for 1 confirmation are not that rare.': 1, "If you are gonna need 1 confirmation for certain products (other than a house or an expensive car) then Bitcoin will fail as a mainstream payment system. \nRequiring waiting time after paying for every day stuff simply won't work.

Former clients will have to file their claims by May 29, 2015,  but there are still no instructions and forms for doing so; he promised to provide them "at a later date, thanks for your patience".  Then the liquidator and the court will have to validate each claim, apparently by September 2015.  \n\nIt is not clear what criterion will be used to define each client\'s loss.  My guess is that the liquidator has no idea either.  Most likely, any remaining bitcoins will be auctioned, and the payouts will be in yen only.  The company assets cover only ~20% of the client account balances; so depending on how many clients file claims, and how they will be evaluated, those clients may get only a fraction of their accounts back.\n\nComments by former clients in the bitcointalk forum show considerable confusion, especially about what will constitute a claim; and general unwillingness to get competent advice, namely from a lawyer who understands Japanese bankruptcy law.  However, that forum may represent the state of mind of a tiny minority of clients only.  Presumably the larger clients have retained their own lawyers.\n\nPS. The biggest unknown (which the former clients at bitcointalk apparently do not understand) is how the claims will be evaluated.  Many clients apparently assume that their claims are simply their  account balances at some date in early 2014.  However, the standard practice in cases like this (for example, in the Madoff ponzi bankruptcy) is to ignore the fictitious balances that the company was posting, and instead consider how much each client deposited, minus how much he has withdrawn.  So, for example, if a client deposited 100 bitcoins in October 2013 (when the price was 120$/BTC), withdrew 5 bitcoins in November 2013 (price 1000$/BTC) and had 500 BTC in his account when MtGOX folded, by this criterion his claim would be 100 x 120 - 5 x 1000 = 7000$; NOT 500 BTC.  It is not known whether this standard method will be used in MtGOX\'s case,  and apparently no one understood the issue enough to ask the liquidator about it.': 29, '/u/changetip 10000 bits': 7, 'Mt Gox owes me like $0.001 that was left in my account when I bailed on them after their first goxing.': 1}, ('Does anyone know where to find where the message section of a transaction is on the blockchain?', 11): {'> Please help.

The one thing such regulations will not do is protect consumers or prevent crime. All it will do is re-concentrate power in those who already have too much power.\n\nBeware of those who tell you that the only way to get "permission" from the governments and banks is to give up the very essence of bitcoin by adopting terrible ideas like blacklisting and mandatory identity. ': 7, 'Patrick Byrne has stated, has pledged, that a percentage of the profits derived from sales of Overstock products paid for with bitcoin will go to fund the Chamber of Digital Commerce.

At this point, the community is strongly motivated to keep its use affordable for their own good and to appeal to newcomers. In the future, the situation may be dramatically different. If Bitcoin is used heavily enough to generate volumes where transactions must compete to be included in upcoming blocks, transaction fees could increase. But this presupposes much higher Bitcoin use, which is another way of saying that Bitcoin would have become a major success. And even in this case, high fees is an extreme possibility.  \n\nBut even in the extreme case of significantly higher transaction fees and only large value transactions on the Bitcoin block chain, many solutions that may be better suited to fast-confirming microtransactions are already being developed. All currently compromise Bitcoin's decentralization or security, but for small value transactions these compromises may be acceptable. Although you could implement some solutions right now (or at least very soon), if you fast forward to the future where large Bitcoin transaction fees *might* be an issue, current efforts would almost certainly be considered crude. For instance, you could peg [Fastcoin (FST)](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=218852.0) as a Bitcoin sidechain quite easily, but it's existing minuscule network and market cap would make it a poor solution. Personally, I'm curious to see what something like [Open Transacations](http://opentransactions.org/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) might accomplish.  \n\nEDIT: I should also mention that a number of micropayment channels for Bitcoin already exist in the wild. They all have their pros and cons, and none has been widely implemented yet. And those are separate from the several centralized commercial approaches, like Coinbase and ChangeTip, which already exist as well.": 1, 'Clear, but then if the tx volume is not large enough it can happen an increase of the transaction fees, erasing one of the very good points of bitcoin (very low fees)': 1, "No one can say for sure what Bitcoin's transaction fee will be that far into the distant future. However, even if it *does* rise significantly above today's rate, it's likely that next generation alternatives for low fee transactions will be available, perhaps as side chains. If that's the case, the remaining transactions on the Bitcoin network would need to tolerate higher fees and the 10 minute confirmation time to be included into a highly secure block chain. Under these circumstances, Bitcoin may become a network devoted primarily to large value transactions that require this level of assurance.  \n\nI think such a scenario is just one extreme possibility, as Bitcoin's self-adjusting nature should gradually tend to reduce the over-mining that currently exists (relative to the network's level of transactions). Presuming scalability issues are addressed favorably, this could very well mean transaction fees remain low and affordable through 2140 and beyond.\n\nOf course, this all presumes that something better has not supplanted Bitcoin itself in the meantime, something I consider possible but perhaps unlikely (Bitcoin's network advantage should give it time to incorporate external innovations should superior technology emerge.)": 3, 'You touched a point that has been in my mind for a long time: there could be a situation where "decentralization" has to be sacrifice in a certain level. Being said that I just have to say that I am a true believer of the benefits and goodness of Bitcoin.

It's impossible to say that far in the future but it is self-adjusting.\n\n": 4, 'The difficulty gets adjusted so that the average time for confirmation remains about 10 minutes, whatever the network hash rate.  However adjustments occur only once every two weeks (2016 blocks to be precise), so there may be variation within that time frame. ': 1, 'agreed. ': 1, 'So, basically one of the strong points everyone is talking about (the very low transaction fees) is unclear. And if Bitcoin is devoted primarily to large value transactions that require this level of assurance then what is going to happen with all the "micro-payment" scenario?.': 2, 'The speculation is the transaction volume will generate sufficient fees. \n\nTransaction fees should eclipse block subsidy long before subsidy goes to zero. ': 2, 'By the time the block reward ends, hopefully the tx volume will be large enough so miners still have incentive to mine solely for a large number of very small fees.  ': 6, 'At the present transaction rate (~500 per block) and network cost (on the order of 25 BTC per block), the  average transaction fee would have to be 0.05 BTC = ~18 USD to provide the same revenue to miners.\n\nAs a percentage of the transaction volume, the numbers are more reasonable: ~150\'000 BTC/day of total transaction outputs (excluding estimated changebacks), 3600 BTC/day of block rewards, meaning a 2.4% fee on transaction output amount would be enough.\n\nHowever, all those numbers are expected to change a lot by the time miners become dependent primarily on fees.  The volume, in particular, is expected to increase a lot; so that a much smaller percentage of the transaction output amount would provide the same revenue to miners as block rewards do today.\n\nOn the other hand, the fees will be charged on all transactions, even those that move coins between addresses owned by the same person -- such as tumbling, hotwallet-coldwallet transfers, exchange withdrawals and deposits, or moving coins to a new address when one suspects that the old key could have been stolen.  Presently, most transactions on the blockchain (accounting perhaps  for 90% of the volume or more) seem to be "fake" in this sense.  When fees become mandatory, most of those "fake" transactions will probably disappear, so the miner\'s revenue would have to be collected from a much smaller set of "actual" transactions.': 0}, ('Remind your favorite bitcoin accepting shop about Bitcoin Black Friday', 4): {'Did the same and was successful as well.

Currently, to withdraw from Cryptsy, for example, you provide an address, but Poloniex requires you to provide a coin and an address, so to support Poloniex the new code needs to perform additional database queries, which need to be tested and debugged.\n\nOne should be able to go "GET http://exchange.com/api/key=XXX&action=withdraw&coin=LTC&destination=LXXXX" or "GET http://exchange.com/api/key=XXX&action=price&coin=AUR&depth=1.5" to any exchange and have consistent functionality.  If exchanges want to augment these features with custom commands, they can seek to have them standardized or they can just publish them in addition to the standard commands.\n\nSmall exchanges would benefit most from standardization, because the real money is made from automated traders and institutions, not from people who use the website.  Then, someone could write a single open source wrapper that allows you to choose which exchange you want to trade at and execute trades in the same way.\n\nThe benefits of this are enormous.  Not only does it enable innovative services, but it destroys people like the CryptoPumpGroup who try to play games with coins, because arbitrage bots would eliminate their antics in seconds.  Coins would become more likely to be valued on their merits, rather than who has implemented bots at a particular exchange.': 4, 'The only address I see is an American address, so forgive me if I am skeptical that they are from Belize.': 3, "explains why cryptsy employee's are begging people to take advangtage of them on reddit. \nhttp://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2myzkq/record_btcusd_market_days_on_cryptsy/\n\nbecause they are taking a last gasp of air before they go under.

If you put in a limit bid order at $9999 for 1 bitcoin that is saying "I want 1 bitcoin, and the most I will pay for it is $9999, but will accept any lower price."\n\nSome exchanges put caps on how high or low you can set the price, but this can be problematic with a volatile market. BTC-E had limits like this (idk if they still do) and it occasionally caused problems when prices went way up or down\n\nThe problem here isn\'t that Cryptsy is trying to scam users, but rather that many crypto traders are newbies to trading.\n\nIf Cryptsy is truly intentionally scamming users, then I don\'t think this is how they are doing it. The real place to look is the mining contracts and alt-coins. Most of the time when I look at the new coins they add, the github has no information, they have some shitty website (or no website), many times they have no volume anywhere but cryptsy, they get pumped and dumped a few times, then everyone forgets. How unlikely is it that at least some of these coins are made by someone at Cryptsy or some friend of Cryptsy? Then you look at the mining contracts, these are designed to lose value, and have a set "IPO" price. Sure you might break even, but in the time that takes you could have earned more money through interest. The only way to really benefit from these contracts is if you are the one selling them, or if you take advantage of the low liquidity (through scalping)': 1, "> Your software could be programmed to skip the bad data\n\nHow about you fix your shit so that it doesn't send out bad data?": 4, 'In a regulated financial environment, yes.

But keep in mind that our Poloniex code isn't even tested yet, and we don't have enough manpower even to get that finished.\n\nIt's not a matter of providing a lot of features in an exchange; it's just that it takes too long to implement an API for a new exchange to justify the benefits.  Don't get me wrong; we would do anything to have an exchange with great customer service.  But even if Cryptsy continues to rip us off with these sorts of issues, we could lose hundreds of dollars a month to Cryptsy and it would still cost less than the development time required to get a new exchange working.\n\nThat said, we'd be glad to talk with you to see if you have any suggestions.  Let me know when you are available and I or my partner can call you.": 1, 'lol': 0, 'There has been constant unsubstantiated FUD, that is for sure.': 1, 'The answer is both.  There are really three things that need to be confirmed.\n\nFirst, the code needs to be tested to determine that, if provided proper inputs, it will execute the proper operation.  That is done.\n\nSecond, we need to verify that the code is actually being provided the proper inputs.  That\'s not done, because Poloniex expects different inputs than Cryptsy does.  For example, Poloniex market names are reversed - whereas most exchanges have something like MEC/BTC, Poloniex has BTC_MEC.  We need to add additional tables to store these, and then test the queries to make sure they are correct.  There is no good reason for any exchange to have different market names than the others.\n\nThird, we need to verify that the right amount of money is executed.  For example, Cryptsy subtracts the withdrawal fee from the amount you want to withdrawal, so when we withdrawal 3 bitcoins every night, we get 2.999 out, leaving 7 bitcoins of the original 10.  But other exchanges subtract the withdrawal fee from the exchange balance, so the same request would cause our wallet to receive 3 bitcoins, and the exchange account to have 6.999 left.  Again, there is no good reason for a lack of standardization on this feature.\n\nThe amount of effort to deal with the different withdrawal amounts alone is immense.  We have tables with boolean columns for various values:  "market_name_first," "withdrawal_fee_inclusive," "fills_at_best_price," and so on.  Some exchanges don\'t even list their withdrawal fees in their APIs, so they need to be manually entered.

This doesn\'t ever get down voted when posted, although it\'s not common.  It tends to happen mostly on the Github page, developer mailing list etc. instead as far as I\'m aware.\n\nMost other "criticism" is just thinly veiled concern trolling, when ultra persistent posters of unknown motivation constantly try and scream the sky is falling due to an endless litany of "problems" that can never be satisfactorily addressed (according to the troll, who will just move the issue every time their concern is addressed).\n\nA recent example of this from /u/cryptard:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2m8zpx/would_you_be_happy_if_an_altcoin_became_dominant/\n\nCommon "criticisms" that get down voted because there\'s known solutions / it\'s not really a problem / the asker doesn\'t get it yet include:\n\n* Mining centralisation (Guaranteed Ghashcoin, yes that lasted didn\'t it)\n* Blockchain size increasing (Bitcoin will never work, but if it did it couldn\'t handle Visa scale traffic tomorrow!!)\n* It\'s only used for drugs / not enough merchants accept it / not big enough merchants accept it / not enough merchants in my area accept it (endless goal post shifting)\n* It\'s volatile (it\'s getting more popular in waves, thus volatility.  I guess the trolls think it can continue its exponential growth while remaining perfectly stable on the free market against other currencies)\n* Development only rests in the hands of a few (Bitcoin is still small, and not one of the trolls has ever decided to proactively fix this problem by contributing any code themselves)\n* Coin XYZ has feature that Bitcoin never has / Bitcoin 2.0 will magically appear from God and Bitcoin will be worthless (network effects, forkability of code, sidechains etc.)\n* It\'s reputation is too poor, the community is too fanatical, everyone believes it\'s a Ponzi scheme etc. (well we\'re growing exponentially, so there\'s that.  Also: misinformed is preferable to ignorance, since it\'s only possible to move in one direction on the unaware > misinformed > informed progression.  The community is only surviving and thriving in the face of endless criticism and mockery because it is at times and in parts very hardcore, and that\'s great)\n* Confirmation times are too slow (10 minute block time > 3 month Credit Card confirm, 0 conf transactions, multisig, third party backers for POS transactions etc.)\n\nList not exhaustive.\n\nEdit:  Also, any other variant of "I just discovered Bitcoin and I think XYZ (especially incentive scheme / code / economics / community) needs to be changed for Bitcoin to succeed."\n\nNo, it doesn\'t.  Everything in Bitcoin is the way it is for very good reasons, it\'s been doing incredibly well on a multi-year timeframe, and if you\'ve only found out about Bitcoin five minutes ago you definitely have not spotted a critical flaw in the incentive scheme, code, economics or community that the millions of people who know more about Bitcoin than you have not.  Think on it some more and do some more reading.\n\nEdit 2:  I\'m 2 for 2 in getting gold for shooting down Bitcoin critics.  I should do this for a living.  I for one embrace my new gilding overlords.\n\nEdit 3:  /u/GeorgeForemanGrillz has arrived in the comments below to provide an example on this actual post of concern trolling.  Thanks mate.  I assume the irony of this situation escapes him/her.\n\nEdit 4:  Note the persistence of /u/GeorgeForemanGrillz, who consistently starts posts with an outright, strong sounding denial like "Bullshit!" that appears authoritative to people who don\'t know better, then a bit of "well you\'re all delusional because you obviously just ignore any inconvenient truths / critics", and then concludes the rather short post with some kind of "but <qualifies or finds a new exception outside the scope of the previously addressed concern>".  This can continue ad-infinitum, which is why it\'s better to just down vote and ignore.\n\nThe ultimate irony of all the critics claims that /r/Bitcoin is such a cult is that the mods here are very lax about allowing obviously malicious, persistent individuals to continue posting and be heard (and the community just hits them with down votes most of the time when they don\'t have a valid point).  Head over to /r/Buttcoin and you\'ll find they\'ve got their CSS set up to hide the down vote arrow, but if you post anything pro Bitcoin somehow you still end up getting down voted.
