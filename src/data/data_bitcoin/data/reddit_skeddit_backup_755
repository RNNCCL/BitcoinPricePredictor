With this movement, Bankinter becomes one of the first banks in the world dealing with Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nFunded last June by 4 engineers as the first company in the world using Bitcoin as social capital, Coinffeine is developing a distributed platform to exchange FIAT by crypto\xc2\xadcurrencies in a secure and anonymous way, using your own bank account for sending FIAT money and transferring the bitcoins outside the bank, in a pure P2P way.\n\nCoinffeine is a desktop application \xe2\x80\x98like Bittorrent for your bitcoins\xe2\x80\x99 and will be launched the next January. The big innovation here is the Coinffeine protocol, a mathematical model based on Game Theory. This protocol ensures the safety in the FIAT\xc2\xadBitcoin exchange without a trusted third party and in a automatically way, offering the same experience as a traditional exchange thought the transactions are really P2P.\n\nThe strategy of Bankinter with this movement is not only to participate in the capital of the company but also to be one of the main clients of Coinffeine in the future.\n\nCoinffeine has been selected among the 12 most innovative startups in Spain at the stcimmersion.com to be presented this week at the Silicon Valley Forum \xc2\xadsvforum.org\xc2\xad in San Francisco.': 5, 'Maybe.

I\'ll try to explain, but I don\'t expect to succeed entirely, as finance and banking are extremely complex monsters.\n\nIn case you were not aware, bank depositors *today* get first dibs in recovering their deposits from bankrupt banks, because, after all, it is *their money* that they are owed, as opposed to just a stake in the bank (like a stockholder has) which bears the risk of the bank going bust without recourse to recover anything.\n\nThis is a tradition that is hundreds of years old, and it\'s the **foundation** of the banking system.  Think about it: would you give the bank your money if, in exchange for your money, they gave you a *non-binding* promise to repay you, or a piece of paper representing a stake in the bank with no promises to redeem it?  No, of course not -- if that\'s what you got from your deposits, you\'d simply buy stock, or bonds, or mutual funds, or any other equally-worthless-pro-se piece of paper.  You deposit your money in the bank because, legally, there is the guarantee that the bank will have to return *your* money to *you first*, before settling any of their irresponsibly-incurred debts or hotshot stockholders.  That\'s *the* difference between a bank account and a brokerage account, and (if you will allow me the imprecision) it\'s why funds in bank accounts are not expected to give you the returns of stock holdings or other financial instruments -- precisely because your risk of default (the bank giving you dick instead of your money back) is *supposed* to be much lower for a bank depositor.\n\nWhat this measure reported by EPJ means, is a dramatic change in this tradition.  They\'re *retroactively* changing the legal classification of bank deposits, of course without any sort of credible informed and explicit consent of any of the affected people (the depositors).  After this measure goes into effect, when a bank goes bust, your deposits in that bank get effectively converted to "shares" of the bankrupt bank.  This means that you are now in the category of *unsecured creditor*, which means you\'re in the *very last batch* of people who get money back in the bankrupt bank\'s liquidation process.  If the bank has any financial debts or backed-up expenses (as any bankrupt bank normally does), then the creditors of those debts get their money.  You, the depositor, now legally classified in the same risk category as regular stockholders of the bank, get whatever is left over.  To put it in pedestrian terms: you get dick.  Worse still: after this decision takes effect, there will be *no place where you can put your money* that will treat your money as a bona fide first-priority debt to you.  Every other financial instrument has a risk of default with no fiduciary obligation to repay you.\n\nIn other words, this is Bailout 3.0: the new and improved plan from financiers of the world to "solve" the catastrophes they\'ve racked up with their irresponsible financial deals -- they are legalizing the big fuck you they\'ve planned to give to their customers.\n\nIt\'s also good news for Bitcoin.

I know that meme is rather popular, but it's simply not true.  Bank runs happen because (a) people fear that a bank will fail (b) people run to the bank to withdraw (c) the bank, being fractional reserve, cannot fulfill the withdrawal requests.  The existence or absence of the FDIC changes none of those three factors.\n\nOf course, I could be wrong, but if you want me to change my mind, you are going to need to present evidence supporting your contention.\n\n------------------------\n\nAs an aside -- the likely effect of this measure is accurately described by the OP as follows:\n\n>> However, I do not suspect that the world's governments have suddenly found Jesus/Rothbard. I suspect what is going on here is that the government is fully aware that this change will create a separation between bank deposits and government securities. Government securities, especially short-term paper, will become a safer investment than large banks deposits. This will drive funds away from banks and private sector lending and push funds into the direction of government sponsored debt (where there will be continued back up for such debt of the money printing presses).\n\nIn other words: depositors with large amounts of money in the bank (>$250K) will deduce that their money is no longer as safe as before the measure we're discussing, so they will withdraw that cash money to buy government securities instead.\n\nFrom a cause-effect perspective, we can safely discount whatever excuses given for the measure and assume that the intended (but unstated) goal is to manipulate wealthier-than-average people with fear into buying government papers, thus artificially inflating demand for government papers.\n\nI leave it to you to deduce what likely effect that collective action, by many super-rich people, will have upon the banking industry and larger financial sector.\n\n": 1, 'in what world do we gentlemen': 3, "Point taken.

But if it *does* skyrocket at that time and for those reasons, then it will be a different sort of bubble than the one allegedly caused by the Willy-Bot on Gox injecting "unlimited" [virtual ie PHP/MySQL-backed?] fiat in Nov-Dec 2011 into that now-defunct exchange - in other words, it could be a bubble that would pop very little - unlike the long slow decline from 1100-1200 USD to 300-400 USD we saw in 2014.)': 8, 'My thoughts exactly ': 3, "Thanks for this.

A well-funded attacker maybe able to double-spend transactions in the last blocks, but to reverse the entire chain in a short time is next to impossible.

Maybe they\xe2\x80\x99ll be generating lots of addresses, or using computing power to examine many alternate block histories (under proof-of-stake (PoS), both of these use CPU power to increase the likelihood of generating coins). \n\nThere is an extreme fallacy being made here - namely, that marginal cost == total cost. How is this relevant to PoS? So, there are two ways that you can expend resources to benefit more from PoS. The first, as Paul describes, is that stakeholders can try producing lots and lots of different blocks to find blocks that are favorable to themselves. In a well-designed PoS algo, this is outright information-theoretically impossible, since determining which kind of block would select you as a future voter relies on future information. In less well-designed, but still decent, algos, you can increase your probability with exponential effort. Hence, we can make a table as follows:\n\n      VOTING PROB | TOTAL COST | MARGINAL COST\n      ----------------------------------------\n      0           | 0          | 0\n      20          | 1          | 1\n      21          | 2          | 1\n      22          | 4          | 2\n      23          | 8          | 4\n      ...         | ...        | ...\n      30          | 1024       | 512\n      31          | 2048       | 1024\n\nNow, suppose that one unit of voting probability is worth 500 units of value to you. Then, you have the incentive to crank up your voting probability to 30. So what are the results? You\'ve done 1024 work, and you\'ve gained 15000 value. Even though marginal cost == marginal revenue, total cost == total revenue * 0.07. And with well-designed algos marginal cost flips straight from zero to infinite, so the total cost is actually near-zero.\n\nNow, the other kind of "work" that you can do in PoS is sacrifice more of your stake into the long-term deposit voting pool, sacrificing liquidity. However, here we have two points:\n\n1. Marginal cost vs total cost just as above; most people would suffer almost zero from parking 70% of their coins, but would see a break-even point at ~80-90%, so total cost / total revenue < 0.1, just as above.\n2. Locking up capital increases the value of the remaining coins which are distributed among all users, so the liquidity is actually from a social viewpoint redistributed and not sacrificed. This is a public good, so standard economic analysis that other people will pay you for giving them that liquidity so you will add even more stake until MR actually == MC does not apply. Note that the effect here, using a public good as a sort of trapdoor to break the equivalence between marginal social return and marginal individual cost, is a very important trick in cryptoeconomics.\n\nFinally, note that proof of stake is not meant to be as secure as the reward; it\'s meant to be as secure as the slasher security deposit, which can be much higher than the reward. So that\'s also another way that (good) PoS does an end run around this particular concern.\n\n> Others worry about a \xe2\x80\x98black market\xe2\x80\x99 for once-full-but-now-empty private keys.  ....    Attackers can go back to an early episode, or even the first episode, and cheaply rewrite the show in parallel ways. They can (and will) do this to the extent of their computing power.\n\nSolved by weak subjectivity (sounds like I really need to write a blog post properly explaining what weak subjectivity is at some point...)\n\n> This adds an incentive for nodes to support the network, and provides a way to initially distribute coins into circulation, since there is no central authority to issue them.\n\nUmm... token sale? Proof of burn? Snapshot? \n\n> Coin-dropping and then slowly destroying or shuffling coins (as seen in NXT / Ripple / Bitshares) disproportionately favors the users who got all of the coins! This is true even if the coins are in some way auctioned, as the \xe2\x80\x98free option\xe2\x80\x99 to participate in the auction is only present to those individuals who [a] know that the auction is taking place and [b] happen to arbitrarily possess the relevant background for understanding the risks/reward of the auction. \n\nMining has exactly the same deficiencies, except on a longer time scale: past 2040, there will be no more mining distribution, and so mining disproportionately favors people who were alive before then. The only solution to this problem is to make mining permanently issue N coins per year; in fact rather ironically this was the planned distribution model for Ethereum back when we were convinced we would be PoW forever, and yet I seem to have utterly failed in my mission to convince this community that such permanent linear distribution is a more fair and correct model.\n\n> Finally, an immediate giveaway (\xe2\x80\x9cAct now or lose out forever!\xe2\x80\x9d) places an arbitrary and unjustified discount on empiricism, the virtue of waiting patiently for evidence about a system to accumulate. Thus, a coin-drop-auction also disproportionately rewards [c] unjustified optimism (gullibility). \n\nSure. It actually is also my stance that one-time token sales are a highly imperfect model, and I would much prefer a coin that issues out units of itself to pay for ongoing development a la [futarchycoin](https://blog.ethereum.org/2014/08/21/introduction-futarchy/) or DPOS.\n\nMy own fundamental theory about PoS is this: PoS in principle is likely to be superior because it has a much higher sub-choice dimensionality. PoW is PoW; you can do ASIC-resistant algos, you can do useful algos, you can go GHOST, but the fundamental workings don\'t really change (the only really serious modification to PoW I\'ve seen is one that I\'ve invented myself (and maybe others before me, not sure), namely [TaPoW](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2m8sh9/am_i_missing_something_blockchain_without_bitcoin/cm272vv)). With PoS, however, you\'re basing your consensus mechanism on something which is inside the protocol and hence controlled by the protocol, giving you a much larger set of options to choose from, including security deposits, randomly selecting voters for each block from a much larger set, arbitrary punishment mechanisms, blockmaker-driven PoS versus Pebble-style leader-free PoS versus TaPoS, etc. There are two versions of PoW, and billions of versions of PoS. So you need to have a very strong argument in favor of PoW in order to show that the right algo out of a billion and two is one of the two PoW ones.': 7, 'If it could be an altcoin it would be an option but it looks like it wants the security of a SideChain dependent on modified Bitcoin code.': 0, 'This.

The reason is not that there are many possibilities to design such an algorithm. The reason has to do with complexity. 1) All money gets created at genesis. 2) This implies a chain of signatures from known stakeholders. 3) network topology can be leverered (blacklisting). In such a system there is no need to track nodes outside the network - in Bitcoin any computer can create a block. In 100% PoS only stakeholders can produce blocks. A good PoS implementation can be done in 3kLOC, and the amount of cognitive effort is 100x lower than PoW, where most development is wasted on irrelevant or even absurd things. This leads to the right and useful abstractions.\n\n"Mining" wasn\'t a concept in Bitcoin at all (source: the whitepaper). The PoW concept in relation to digital cash was introduced to solve a certain problem at a certain time (it\'s really an extension of hashcash in that sense). Anyone who designs a system based on PoW in 2014 does not understand really the purpose in the first place. This obsession with "miners" is amazingly mistaken. Of course we can get rid of miners, and mining has nothing whatsoever to do with "network security".\n\nPoS was designed as an extension to PoW. Ultimately we got a 100% PoS working. But because people have such a herd mentality it takes a long time for the right ideas to get adapted. I predict however that someone will design a system which has a network effect embedded in it (somewhat similar to PoW distribution). That\'s when it will take off. It will likely not be block-chain based as we know it.': -1, "Umm... you always have to trust someone. Did you personally write or review your client software?

The current total value of all PoS coins is 70 million dollars.  \n\n\n\nWhitepapers of those 3 coins:\nhttp://peercoin.net/assets/paper/peercoin-paper.pdf\n\nhttp://bitshares.org/delegated-proof-of-stake/\n\nhttps://wiki.nxtcrypto.org/wiki/Whitepaper:Nxt\n\nUltimately users will use what they like and what is helpful for them. For sure it's more risky to buy new coins with unsure security aspects. But there is also more upside. Most upside might come from totally new coin, but it's unlikely that average joe can pick the winner (just like in the stock market). Marketing is a contra-indiactor.": 4, 'No, what I am saying is trust is a very vague notion, when you give away your trust you don\'t know if it\'s just a little or too much, you don\'t even know who you are really giving it to, history is full of these examples, that\'s actually how the financial reality of the world came to be. Also on the internet, identity is a dime a dozen so you "everyone" may just not be able to match the number of my "everyone" if I am well funded.': 2, '>If you are a new user, who do you trust? \n\n"Trust", that\'s all you have to say actually.\n\nI prefer to trust my bankers in fact, they are such respectable and professional people.': 1, 'I totally agree, the PoW reward also drops by 50% exponentially until it is no more than the marginal cost to provided the necessary security. ': 2, "If perfected, PoS has many obvious benefits over PoW.   \n\nOne reason I think we see a lot of PoS FUD is because of the 'mining-industrial-complex' ;). It's already a $500mm+ industry in market cap.  5-6 rich and powerful groups now make all the mining equipment, and they probably want it to stay that way.\n\nWhat will all the cloudhashing and BFL's of the world do if PoW dies out?  How will BitFury executives pay for their yachts and jets?  think of the 0.0001% !": -2, 'yes. + all bitcoin devs are on record trashing PoS... their voice carries a lot of weight.': 1, "Actually, no, he's right here. Marginal != total. MC = MR means that people will continue working until the psychic+measurable costs increase and/or returns decrease to the point where working any more will no longer be worth the additional effort.": 5, "One thing the author missed however was if one was to change the incentive structure in the Bitcoin protocol PoW may not be effective.\n\nHis business proposal dependent on manipulating the very thing he's advocating for.\n\nBitcoin PoW incentivizes mining and encourages cooperation by paying in Bitcoin stored on the Bitcoin blockchain.\n\nIf one where to be able to do PoW on a SideChain say merge mining along side Bitcoin it would be possible to mine on one chain cooperatively and the other maliciously, effectively earning with 100% of ones mining power and attacking with 100% of ones mining power.\n\n This perversion may be exaggerated , but it would be impossible to do in Bitcoin now but possible if the proposed SideChain protocol change is implemented.  ": 2, "Typical vbuterin, one sentence to slightly address the main point of the article, then everything else is for making his own point about PoS.\n\nMarginal cost !=total cost in mining, but it's the other way, when total consumption of mining power approaches a percentage of global power consumption, the total cost to 51% attack the entire network would be much higher than the marginal cost. Imagining having to put 10% of your nation's electricity off-grid to conduct the attack, your industries will basically stall to a halt.\n\n>since determining which kind of block would select you as a future voter relies on future information.\n\nGuess what future information is closest to provably irretrievable beforehand, that's exactly why people use hash functions for mining.": 7}}}
