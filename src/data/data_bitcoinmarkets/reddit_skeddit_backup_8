{'10-22-2015': {('[Daily Discussion] Thursday, October 22, 2015', 23): {"I'm a social progressive, and know many like me who are into Bitcoin.  There is plenty interesting in the Bitcoin space regardless of your political outlook.  Libertarians have a particular wet dream about Bitcoin, and in /r/Bitcoin it can froth up into high fantasy, which can definitely get nauseating.\n\nStill there is something quite promising about the incorruptibility of the blockchain.": 3, 'Hmm, maybe.\n\nI\'ve met libertarians in person. I was one, once.\n\nBut I am too often confronted by *extreme* libertarians who tell me they don\'t want government at all. I ask them, okay, how would society work under such a scheme? They don\'t have good answers. They don\'t seem to understand the concept of a power vacuum, or the necessity of leadership. So I no longer identify as a libertarian.\n\nI want small government, but some government. Not much regulation, but some regulation. I think there is such a thing as a happy medium.\n\nI think certain types of public services can\'t be maintained purely through acts of selflessness. Volunteers can\'t do it all. But hey, I live in a socialist country, so... maybe that colors my views. *Maybe I\'m wrong.*\n\nThe thing that bugs me is that I don\'t hear too many other libertarians saying "maybe I\'m wrong". It\'s their way or the highway.': 6, 'You gotta dig deep for the good communities. The big, easy to find ones have been overtaken by the delusional. ': -2, 'Bitcointalk is even worse... More anarchism.': 3, "Yup. They're very very stupid people, best not to bother and save your sanity.": -1, "To be honest, I'm kind of hoping I'm wrong.\n\nI see tons of promise for a technology like bitcoin. Use cases have been made for very interesting things (although almost none have come to fruition yet).\n\nI bought some stuff on Newegg with bitcoin. Hey, there's some legal adoption for you. But it felt kind of... pointless. I bought bitcoin with money, then gave them bitcoin. So really, bitcoin was just a middle man - despite the fact that it's supposed to have the opposite effect. It would feel less pointless if I were *paid* in bitcoin, no doubt, but that future seems intangible unless I work for a bitcoin company.": 2, "It seems like it's a lot of different things to a lot of different people. Just like the internet is probably used differently by a lot of different people, in most cases for the better but in many for the worse. The bitcoin network might have attributes that push in the direction of one or another social outcome (limited supply for example, consumption of resources by proof of work, psuedonymity), but the network itself is actually pretty neutral politically and ideologically, it just processes transactions.": 4, '> mainstream\n\nLibertarianism is far more mainstream than the media outlets would have you believe.  Few people want to pay taxes, few think government is their friend, nearly everyone has used illegal drugs and no one thinks they, themselves, should be imprisoned for it.  \n\nIf you want to be using a currency that gives the government maximum control over your neighbors, then bitcoin is probably not for you.': 7, "Those are questions for historians, and I'm not a historian.\n\nMy gut tells me no. I think that's what a lot of politicians *actually do*. But not what they are *supposed to do*.": 2, "Are you sure? I'd love to believe that, but it's not like there are any other big bitcoin communities I know of. It's the biggest one I've ever found.\n\nI mean, bitcointalk is pretty damn big too. And it does seem a bit less crazy. Maybe you're right. ": 2, 'Sending money over the internet?': 3, "Bitcoin can be a lot of things to a lot of different people.  I wouldn't worry too much about a particular group of people trying to pigeonhole its use.  Its a protocol, a platform, a technology and different people will find different uses for it.": 3, 'I remember out household getting the internet in the 80s, we used Lynx and it was all text-based.\n\nBut even then, and to an 8-year-old, the applications seemed abundantly clear: access to information, multiplayer games, chat rooms, etc.\n\nWith bitcoin, the applications are still foggy to me.': 1, "> I wouldn't worry too much about a particular group of people trying to pigeonhole its use.\n\nThey're the primary users.": 0, 'I\'ve been holding onto some bitcoin for two years now. I have long been interested in its application as a "currency of the internet", among other things such as smart contracts and such. And with rising prices, you\'d think I\'d be happy. But today I experienced my first serious doubts about what the heck I\'m doing here. I am starting to wonder if I have not truly considered what bitcoin is. I don\'t mean from a technological point of view, but from a social point of view.\n\nI\'ve always known bitcoiners tend towards the more libertarian side of things. But in the comments of post on /r/bitcoin, today, this was rubbed in my face to an extent I\'ve frankly never witnessed before. The extremism over there is very apparent.\n\nIs this all bitcoin is to people? A tool for circumventing taxation and regulations on what is legal to buy and sell? All these VCs want bitcoin to go mainstream but I doubt that possibility more than ever.': 3, "Maybe we will see $300 soon...going parabolic and that's one of my favorite formations to trade so fine with me.": 1, "> But I am too often confronted by extreme libertarians who tell me they don't want government at all.\n\nSo /r/Bitcoin .": -4, '/r/bitcoin is not representative of actual bitcoin users.': 5, "Hmm, parabolic implies it will come crashing down. Hopefully not!\n\nI think you mean exponential? ;) Sounds like you might be a fan of Ray Kurzweil. A bit nutty but still a fun read. Just don't take it too seriously.": 1, 'Haha, no, I mean, we are their employers. By rights, we should tell them what their job is, and they should say "yes, sir".\n\nI\'m aware that\'s not the way it is. But anarchy is not the solution, because it would only be temporary and lead to the same shit all over again. A power vacuum doesn\'t last long and it\'s very possible to end up in a worse situation. Like, we could end up with very literal warlords.\n\nSo I think anarchy is not the solution. Unfortunately, though, I don\'t know what is.': 3, "that's all that counts china is driving the push and vol. west is just following but thinks they're the leader...": 1, "> They no doubt started...\n\nDon't governments start out as and remain the most dominant force?  Aren't they by definition the most powerful gang in the area?\n\n> make them do their jobs properly\n\nIsn't it their job, above all else, to make sure they stay in control?\n": 2, "By saying '94 I think Im kind of taking in account that bitcoin will advance at more than twice the pace simply because the internet speeds everything up so much.  I'd say currently the understanding is closer to late '80s but we will probably advance to '00 in four or less years.\n\nEdit: One can really see the parabolic rise of tech.  from electricity to transistors to microchips to computers to internet to blockchain to presumably IoT and then AI.  It all makes more significant changes in shorter times.": 1, 'Huh, I guess I didn\'t read the right posts, most of it was get rich quick schemes, how porn and gambling was the future of bitcoin, or questions like "should I sell my coins?".\n\nSo what\'s an example of a bitcoin community that isn\'t driven by anarchy yet still focused on adoption? All these big companies starting up selling bitcoin-based products and services... the anarchists are hating on pretty much all of them for caving in to regulations (not sure what they expect *corporations* to do, but OK). Makes it seem like the community is completely at odds with the industry.': 3, "> The moment someone compares taxation with slavery, I reply, and get myself in a pointless debate where neither one of us changes our mind. Maybe I'd be better off just keeping my mouth shut, haha.\n\nWell, yeah, so sounds like you've got a bit of selection bias going on then. You may have a more positive experience avoiding that debate then for a bit. :-)": 1, 'You could probably draw the comparison to earlier than \'94. We got Internet in our household around 1995, but had some other similar text-based thing before that. Back in the days when people did not click on links, but "followed gopher holes". That\'s really what we called it.\n\nIt was already apparent by that time that it had major education uses, which is why my household got it. When we wanted to know the answer to a question, where before we might consult a physical encyclopedia or Microsoft Encarta, now we just looked it up on the internet.\n\nNot long after images became possible, advertisers really started seeing the potential. Banner ads were everywhere. And pop-ups. And pop-unders. It was insane. So it was clear even then that there was commercial potential\n\nBut nobody suspected Amazon would come along and deliver everything we could want within 2 days for cheaper than buying locally, even after shipping. Or that we could watch HDTV with it. Or make phone calls, or download all the entertainment we wanted. All for cheaper than paying for TV or phone service...\n\nHmm, now that I think of it, it\'s a pretty apt comparison I guess. Things seemed more certain about the internet, but maybe only in retrospect... maybe I misremember some of the details.\n\nI worked in the IT industry starting around 2003. Man, so many of those companies had no clue what they were doing... grasping at straws over and over, and some of them got lucky.\n\n': 1, '> I don\'t hear too many other libertarians saying "maybe I\'m wrong".\n\nI\'m almost always wrong.  There, you\'ve heard it.  But then, so is everyone else.\n\n> necessity of leadership.\n\nYou think politicians and bureaucrats provide leadership?\n\n> They don\'t have good answers.\n\nGiving politicians and bureaucrats the power to control the lives of your neighbors is a good answer?': 3, 'China jacks price up. Buys $10 higher. Accumulates up there. Now only $5 higher. Still some eager buyers in China.': 2, "> Haha, no, I mean, we are their employers\n\nJust because they live off your money does not mean you're the employer.\n\nSo you're saying that the problem with getting rid of government is that we may end up with another government (although they're unlikely to be worse since at least they'll know they're unwelcome).\n\n> So I think anarchy is not the solution. Unfortunately, though, I don't know what is.\n\nNobody does.  If we knew how to get rid of state power and keep it gone, we wouldn't be dealing with it now.  Perhaps we can start by calling things as they are: these people are a bunch of liers, thieves and murders, unworthy of the adoration they've become accustomed to. ": 3, "> Libertarians have a particular wet dream about Bitcoin, and in /r/Bitcoin it can froth up into high fantasy, which can definitely get nauseating.\n\nWe don't get out much.": 1, 'I don\'t imagine that our governments started with the goal of all-encompassing, self-perpetuating bureaucracy.\n\nThey no doubt started with the goal of "okay, we need to work together, who among us can make that happen"? And it ballooned from there.\n\n> You think politicians and bureaucrats provide leadership?\n\nThey are *supposed to*. So perhaps instead of thinking about how to get rid of them, we should think about how to make them do their jobs properly...\n\nI\'ll grant the libertarians a concession, that what we have now is like something out of the Hitchhiker\'s Guide...': 2, "Yes, those are the brogressive leanings of reddit shining through. The whole site is surprisingly cohesive on some issues. \n\nThis sub generally talks about price, the viability of bitcoin longer term, and usually not a whole lot else. I don't happen to know what most people in here think about governments and fiat. This place might be a better fit for you, if you're interested in following the price and potentially trading.": 1, "I recently came across a thread on /r/AskReddit about what peoples oldest memories of the internet were.  The most intriguing to me were the the people form Stanford and MIT talking about communicating with each other and thinking it was really cool but they couldn't figure out what exactly it meant.  I think those days of buying stuff off Newegg and such are kind of comparable to that.  \n\nI know I'm not the first person, but I think there can be a parallel drawn between bitcoin now and the internet in say, '94.  Its on the tip of everyones tongue that there is something big but its not exactly clear how it will take shape. Additionally, it is still yet to be determined wether bitcoin is just the Prodigy or Compuserve before Netscape.  Exciting times.": 3, "> But not what they are supposed to do.\n\nThat's what they would have you believe.  Just vote harder, let them take more money - they'll do it right next time.": 3, 'Welcome to the non-noob clubs': 1, 'Hmm, good points.\n\nWell I think I should still re-evaluate whether to stick with my investment.

To moderate well, you cant base decisions on what\'s right or wrong or what\'s popular or unpopular. You moderate based on your rules. \n\nDostoevsky said something like "the degree of civilization of a society can be judged by entering its prisons". Loosely, this is to say you can judge a group of people by how they treat its members whose rights they strip away. In online communities, this translates to how you treat users who require moderator intervention and how that intervention is handled.\n\nSo as moderators, they give extra rope to the offenders until they hang themselves. And if they don\'t break any rules but just annoy the shit out of most everyone with unpopular or trumped up opinions, so be it.\n\nI\'m not convinced whether the way its done here is best.

It goes like this:\n  1. Every Friday at 12 UTC, on open contracts, all unrealised profit/loss is converted to realised profit/loss at the mark price. On XBT24H, which expires daily, this happens every day at 12 UTC as it expires.\n  2. Realised profit, if any, is then converted to "Rebalanced Profit", less the system loss (DPE %).\n  3. Rebalanced profit is then added to your account balance and can be reused for new positions or withdrawn.\n4. As above - every contract (except XBT24H) expires on a Friday.

The rally started around Sept 22, with few dollar daily gains, and the average daily gain has been more or less increasing ever since... I see no sings of slowing down and many indicators such as MA, OBV is supporting this. \n\nThen again, I'm not claiming that the rally is directly sourced by adoption. I think no major btc price move - up or down - has been directly sourced by adoption itself. \n\nNow this is completely my personal conspiracy but I believe is price is being influenced/manipulated by some invisible group of mega-btc holders who coordinate their buys/sells (almost acting as an invisible central bank of some sorts). Perhaps during the course of 2015 they favored a more stable price, but something has changed lately so now they're either pumping directly or they stopped manipulating so the price is now springing back-up to the levels it should be. BTC's market cap is still a joke and I believe the organic price should be much higher than the current levels... \n\nAnyhow, conspiracies a side, I personally don't think that this rally will end at least before we surpass $400-$450 OR some big negative news arrives that will cause a panic sell.": 3, "I agree with all you said.\n\nParticularly I would like to address this:\n\n>Finally, while adoption of XT failed so far, this is not too surprising given that XT has not been needed. I'm happy that an alternative with bigger blocks exists and is ready to spin up IF we suddenly do need bigger blocks before other solutions are ready.\n\nThis is my true perspective on XT.  I was an early supporter of XT and ran a node before and after the BIP101 implementation.  After careful consideration I withdrew my support and actually became an avid opponent.  I did this not because I hate the idea of ever upgrading to BIP101, but because I thought it best to quash the less than thoughtful mob-style movement for the present time.  But in reality, if other scaling solutions are not available when demand requires them, I like the fact that a working implementation of a scaling solution (while somewhat clunky) is available if absolutely needed.

However, I do not see it that way.  There are several things that could be playing together here, and as a long-term holder, have really eased my worries over this market.  I normally don\xe2\x80\x99t post like this, but rather comment and vote, but because I haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen anything expressing these positions altogether, I decided to post this wall of text.\n\n**First and foremost**, the threat of XT was a real drain.  Not necessarily because it is bad (I am against it, but that\xe2\x80\x99s beside the point here), but because it creates huge uncertainty (will it break Bitcoin?).  Now that XT has failed to adopt, there is no fear that Bitcoin will break because of it.  But this is not all.  XT has gone to show Bitcoin to be far more rigid than previously thought.  A hard fork is now shown to be damn near impossible to accomplish.  Accordingly, this adds a lot more perceived certainty when one is purchasing Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x94it can\xe2\x80\x99t simply be changed at the whim of the majority.  I viewed the run-up over the summer as a quick reaction by those who thought Bitcoin was suddenly about to become scalable.  I viewed the sell-down as likely an indication that when XT was actually released many sold for fear caused by uncertainty.\n\n**Second (and probably just as important)**, the halving is nearing.  There is always some risk associated with owning an experimental digital currency.  Accordingly, those who wish to minimize that risk, but capitalize on predicted movements will delay acquisition until that event is nearer.  While everyone has known the halving is coming, many have likely sought to reduce the exposure by waiting before acquiring (especially while this XT thing was blowing over).  Price rises, however, will create buying pressure for those waiting (FOMO, if you will).\n\n**Third**, the last Silk Road auction.  The prospect of coins being dumped on the market creates a huge uncertainty.  The finality of those auctions removes another uncertainty.  Now the market needs to know what will happen with the Gox coins (and of course Satoshi\xe2\x80\x99s).\n\n**Fourth**, Gemini.  While the owners seem to have hyped its opening, with this factor removed, Gemini\xe2\x80\x99s opening is still positive signal\xe2\x80\x94a fully regulated exchange styled as a trust has approval for operations in the U.S.  The volume there is steadily growing at a rate that would be impressive for an exchange that was not given all the hype.  However, the hype around Gemini\xe2\x80\x99s opening works to add the sense of legitimacy to Bitcoin overall in the U.S. and even to its competitors.\n\n**Fifth**, less bad news generally.  For the past two years, there has constantly been bad news fresh in the memories of those who follow the currency.  Whether it be an exchange collapse, a scam, or a druggy site simply running off with funds, memories like this create a fear of future market conditions.  Plus, there is always the uncertainty of when missing coins will be dumped.  By now, most coins should have been dumped (presumably), and the industry around Bitcoin seems to be being replaced with grownups (many of the old players are in jail, and the new guys seem legitimate).\n\n**Sixth**, agree with them or not, proposed scaling solutions show great promise and are being developed.  While there may be flaws, they seem more promising (at least as far as user experience goes) than the previous singular option of simply increasing the block cap.\n\n**Seventh**, China.  I guess.  I never trust my news sources for what is happening there, but the idea that they are now able to and are apparently buying is bullish (whether for capital controls or other reasons).\n\nThere are other points, but I think I have at least hit the high-points in my mind.  I am not saying that I think that the market will continue to rise.  I am simply saying that these points have alleviated worries as a long-term holder.  And moreover, in the same way, they could easily explain a change in market sentiment that would result in sustainable price increases.  I am not a short-term trader because I am fully aware of my inability to accurately predict short-term movement; my posting this is not a prediction of any short-term movement.\n': 25, 'If we reach $350 I will be a true believer.\n\nThe charts are telling a very interesting story.

When the market is finally ready this can create a trend of major proportions, the effect. On large timeframes, these bursts of pent up energy tend to be the transition from bear to bull markets, and vice versa. \n\nI'm being cautiously optimistic here.

Watching the 20/50/100/200 EMAs move over the last 8 months has been interesting, the two ramps/retraces proved to be a settling out period which was necessary after such dramatic 15 month decline.

That hasn\'t happened since the last bubble. That that will be some serious ass resistance.\n\nI have always thought that this market and the last bubble was much like the massive 2011 bubble up to $32. I don\'t view the April 2013 or Nov. 2013 bubbles as separate events - just one giant bubble. If you think about that year as a giant bubble, and and 2011 as a giant bubble, I think it provides a clearer picture. Liquidity is always increasing with price, so it takes more and more time and effort to move the price. That is a major factor as to why there was a pause in the summer of 2013. Think of liquidity / market cap as "stretching out" or "zooming in" or "magnifying" everything in the market. Movement takes more money, more time, and more movement (think fractals) to occur. \n\nAs a result, I\'ve always looked back to the 2011 aftermath for guidance - that\'s why i never liked to look at the "bubblewatch" etc. because they were looking at tiny microcosms and defining a single period as separate discrete events. My thought process about that:\n\n1. It took almost 2 years to reach previous highs ($32). That was at a time when there was no liquidity in the market at all. Bitcoin was like $5. It\'s been about 2 years since the $1200 day, and I\'d expect another couple of years. I\'m not wed to this idea and it\'s not my strongest conviction, but it\'s my best guess. My counter argument here would be that BTC will move less from trading / store of value and more to rails use-cases, exploding usership and demand, which would make the previous comparison irrelevant anyway. But all things equal and adoption occurring marginally, I don\'t expect $1,000 bitcoins again for a few years. \n\n2. [There were 2 run-ups with bubble-like behavior following the 2011 peak](http://i.imgur.com/eRNfcx2.png). These were catalysts to restore some equilibrium in the market. Ironically, I think that these bubbles were necessary for price discovery. Normally, bubbles damage price discovery because there are yawning chasms of uncertainty where price hasn\'t bounced around. However, back then (and i think now), BTC corrected hard and floated too low for too long - eventually the market agreed that price should be substantially higher. This happened once, led to another softer bubble and stability.\n\n3. I\'d expect that this is following that first bottoming out period - price may jump up to $500 and then hover around $300 for a while. Repeat jump to $900 and then hover around $700 for a while. Bubble still far away. \n\nSo i don\'t think the exact motions will be comparable - you\'d need to look at the 2011 daily to compare it to the current weekly to take into account differences in liquidity and time that i mentioned - and i think that\'s a fool\'s errand anyway. Nothing is ever going to be exactly the same. But i think the similarities are striking.\n\nTL;DR: bitcoin had 2 bubbles: 2011 and 2013.': 6, "I've been in and out of the weeklies since $230.

However, it is completely possible that they put in the bid and wait for someone to sell into it, so their buys don't raise price but merely prevent it from falling.\n\nSo to summarize, your ripple is most likely not felt at all, and if it is felt its effect is dampened by several layers of business logic, and most likely not immediate.\n\nIf you want your ripple to spread, go to public exchange and buy with a market order. :)": 16, 'The affect is immediate because Circle is part of "the bitcoin markets".': 1}, ('Huobi Withdrawl to USD?', 7): {'This would be good to know.

Out of the box, it installs on your computer and runs in a background. It has intuitive user interface and is easy to configure. It has lots of documentation and on-demand support.\n\n> Harmonia is a java application which must be downloaded and compiled by the end-user. It has a console interface. Documentation is minimal, and it is backed by a community support.\n\nHarmonia is designed to be run by anyone who can install a JDK and Maven and run a couple mvn commands. No programming experience is necessary to install Harmonia. It also works on any platform with a JDK, so it's not restricted to Windows. Documentation is minimal because there is not a lot to document. It has simple, straightforward logic that either meets or exceed the performance of using an auto-renew FRR strategy.\n\n> Functionality: When it comes to automation, BFX Swapmaster and Harmonia are using different strategies. The goal of current BFX Swapmaster strategies is to minimize idle time while staying as close as possible to the current market rate. Swapmaster's strategies are configurable in several ways ( see documentation ). Harmonia has fixed strategy that is using FRR as a reference. Of course, user can manually modify the strategy code as it is open source.\n\nThe Harmonia logic also attempts to minimize idle time by being marketable. It will definitely take advantage of the FRR when it's bid or the best offer, but most of the time, when the FRR is far away from being the best offer and there are a thousand other FRR offers that have been sitting for days, Harmonia will happily send marketable fixed rate offers and be filled well before the FRR is touched. This is one approach that allows it to beat auto-renew FRR. It is also often the case that Harmonia will send offers that become active swaps at well above FRR when rates spike as they've done recently. This is another approach that allows it to beat auto-renew FRR.\n\n> Security: With BFX Swapmaster, your keys are stored encrypted on your hard drive and are decrypted only when application needs to connect to the exchange. The software is digitally signed which prevents tampering. Harmonia user has to enter keys manually each time application is started, which means they have to be stored somewhere or generated every time application is started.\n\nConsidering that the BFX API is RESTful, any application will need to have decrypted keys to send to the exchange every time account balances are checked or new offers are sent. Given the nature of swaps where they can be prepaid at any point, good swap bots will be regularly checking BFX to see if any swap has been prepaid to send a new offer. With this, having decrypted keys makes little sense. This is why Harmonia will only store keys in the process and recommends that the process be kept secure (e.g. in a private VM). Harmonia is intended to run for long periods of time, so there is no need to generate new keys while it is running.

It has lots of documentation and on-demand support.\n\nHarmonia is a java application which must be downloaded and compiled by the end-user. It has a console interface. \nDocumentation is minimal, and it is backed by a community support. \n \nFunctionality:\nWhen it comes to automation, BFX Swapmaster and Harmonia are using different strategies. \nThe goal of current BFX Swapmaster strategies is to minimize idle time while staying as close as possible to the current market rate.\nSwapmaster's strategies are configurable in several ways ( see documentation ).\nHarmonia has fixed strategy that is using FRR as a reference. Of course, user can manually modify the strategy code as it is open source.\n\nSecurity:\nWith BFX Swapmaster, your keys are stored encrypted on your hard drive and are decrypted only when application needs to connect to the exchange. \nThe software is digitally signed which prevents tampering.\nHarmonia user has to enter keys manually each time application is started, which means they have to be stored somewhere or generated every time application is started.\n\nSummary:\nThese products are targeting different types of users. \nIn any case, I respect and value efforts of open source developers, and I believe that both commercial and open source alternative have their place in trading software ecosystem.": 2, 'the good one': 3, "Source code?

That\'s the first instance archive.org has of the [site in its modern form](https://web.archive.org/web/20140517151446/http://mmmglobal.org/).  Prior archives are just a demo theme with no content.

However, this is the first global one which allows it to run for much longer and have a slow painful death.  He can pause payments for entire regions at a time to allow him enough money to pay out investors in other regions.  He can keep shifting which region doesn\'t get paid out for a few months and keep shifting around the burden.  However, this isn\'t sustainable and will lead to collapse eventually.  Smart traders should pay very close attention to this pyramid.  Once he starts shutting down more than one region at a time it would signal that it\'s weakening (as does shutting down any regions at all).  Currently China is not shut down like we thought, there are still "success stories" rolling in.\n\nFrom what I gather out of this broken English it seems deposits and withdrawals are done using bitcoin:\n\n> Let\xe2\x80\x99s consider an example now. Say, you have announced willingness to provide help in amount of $100. You will be credited in your PO with 100 Mavros. And they will immediately start to grow every day! But the rate of growth directly depends on your activity. If you perform tasks every day, you get 100% per month. It means, that in a month your initial 100 Mavros will turn into 200 Mavros. Accordingly, you will be able to request assistance for $200 at the current BITCOIN exchange rate.\n\n> However, it is not necessary to wait for a month. Help can be requested at any time. But only after confirmation of your Mavros. What does "after confirmation" mean? It means only after your BITCOIN transfer, when you really provide assistance to another participant. (But not just declare willingness. :-)) Order for providing help comes to you in your Personal Office. If you do not complete it within 36 hours, you will be removed from the System!\n\nSo what this means is that once the pyramid does collapse, bitcoin is going drop like a rock.  All of those people will cash out whatever bitcoins they have left all over a quick span of a few days.  However, for now buying bitcoin looks like a safe bet as this scam continues to run its course.\n\nIt also looks like they are [having multi-level marketing/get rich quick scheme seminars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y0vvpCHwy7w&#t=41m30s) where they "educate" people about bitcoin.\n\nEdit:  The [MMM China testimonial page](http://china-mmm.net/wineletters/page-34813/) has the first testimonial as 8/2/2015.

Well thanks for the information \n\nCheers': 1, "The price used for margin calculations is based off the TradeBlock price (Mark Price), not the Last Price. This means that you can't simply cause liquidations by swinging the market up and down. The underlying index price (which is [an average of the 5 largest markets](https://tradeblock.com/markets/index/)) must change in order to be liquidated.\n\nLiquidity and spreads are good.

I've been wondering a bit about the future of BTC trading with all the exchange drama lately, but every time I log onto your platform I think 'this is for me'. \n\nOutfits like BitMEX and Cryptowatch stoke me out every time they post an update, and the regularity is refreshing. Thanks again for your commitment to community interaction. \n\n\n\n": 10, "This is intentional - while we are working on a simpler Bitcoin-only display, it has drawbacks. Here's why:\n\nThe value of a contract fluctuates at the same time the price does. Our XBT contracts, for example, are worth 1000 satoshis per $1 price. Since a Bitcoin is 100,000,000 satoshis, at a price of $100, 1000 contracts equals one Bitcoin. \n\nSo in the orderbook, it would be fair to display 1000 contracts as a 1 Bitcoin order. But what about 1000 contracts at $110? Well, that's actually worth 1.1 Bitcoin, so what do you display? Both orders are for the same number of contracts.\n\nThis leads to a lot of confusion as you try to close out a position. For example, if you open 1000 contracts at $100 (1 BTC value), and the price goes up to $110, how large of a sell do you need to place? Placing a sell for 1 Bitcoin will leave you with a partially open order.\n\nThis is why our competitors so thoroughly differentiate different orders as different positions. On their platforms, you can even have opposite positions in the same contract!\n\nWe chose to get around this issue by showing the precise number of contracts you hold, rather than fudge it by showing a Bitcoin value and rounding it to the nearest contract. In the future, we may offer both displays, but we have yet to see an acceptable and intuitive method of showing BTC-only values that doesn't have significant compromises.\n\nAs /u/peasantwizard mentioned below, the easiest way to know the value of an order is to simply fill it in and read the `Order Value`. That's the total value of the contracts. The `Margin` fields just below it show what the actual cost would be. Note that if you're long, opening a sell actually doesn't cost any margin, because it doesn't increase your position!": 4, "> We use a mark price system that prevents this. Margin calculations are always done on the underlying index price, not the last price. A cascade is impossible; you'll only see large swaths of liquidations if the index price makes large movements, but liquidations themselves will never be the cause of more liquidations.\n\nWhile this is true, but what happens if index price undergoes a massive movement? That isn't unheard of in bitcoin land. What happens if you have liquidations that are larger than the current available liquidity at the current spot price? How do you handle that risk? Nevermind cascading margin calls, I mean just normal (but aggressive) market movements. Similar to the drop to $166 at the beginning of the year or the Coinbase lunar pump.": 2, 'I\'m not sure what you mean when you say that we "don\'t have the full BTC volatility data". In fact, we\'re the only exchange to have ever traded Bitcoin volatility. While we suspended those contracts due to low liquidity, we still record daily calculations of volatility on a [monthly](https://www.bitmex.com/app/index/.BVOL), [weekly](https://www.bitmex.com/app/index/.BVOL7D) and [intraday](https://www.bitmex.com/app/index/.BVOL24H) basis.\n\nWe are well aware of the risk of running these contracts, which is why we instituted the [DPE](https://www.bitmex.com/app/dynamicProfitEqualisation) system to begin with. This risk management system shares many properties with the familiar socialized loss systems at many Chinese exchanges, with a few tweaks that we believe make it more effective.\n\nThis system has been extensively tested internally and with real-world trades since we launched it. There have been some losses in the past, and they have been recovered by the system without issue and according to design.\n\nIt is possible that a large volatility swing could create a high loss rate on daily futures. This is mitigated by two factors:\n\n1. The future settles daily and starts with a clean slate; any losses are reset every day at 12 GMT.\n2. We publish the indicative loss percentage in real-time. We expect the pricing of the future to incorporate this loss percentage in how it trades, as traders are able to see their expected profit cap before they decide to trade.\n\nIf volatility really picks up and 100x turns out to be too much to trade without high losses, we will adjust the rates or work to grow liquidity until it is.': 4, 'I thought that was temporary, mine work fine, I never noticed a ban in the first place.': 1, "I agree with your concerns /u/BTCVIX. Liquidity has much improved on our platform in the last two months, and with that, our volume has grown nearly 8x since mid-August. It is easier than ever to get out of positions.\n\nThat said, there's always room for improvement. There is a significant difference between 100x on dailies and 100x on weeklies, or especially 100x on monthlies. On a daily, at the very worst case, you have the liquidity to get out of your position at settlement. When markets are sideways, this is a decent last-resort.\n\nOf course, we will be watching and evaluating XBT24H as a test market. We have talked internally about possibly dynamically adjusting the maximum leverage based on a historical volatility calculation, but that could confuse users.\n\nRe: the CFD / Bucket Shop model, we're not interested in being the counterparty to all users' trades. It creates too many perverse incentives and puts the exchange at significant risk during volatile periods. Shops like SimpleFX/1Broker have had problems in the past when the market has moved quickly and the last thing we want to do is risk our company's funds (or our users') by taking naked risk.": 7, 'How about lately, when BTC price on BFX was for a while 162$ and on bitstamp 221$ (august 18) or look at august 25 - massive margin calls will happen with that margin. Why wont you offer max 20x': 1, '/u/lowstrife, please see my [answer to a similar question](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3og5tf/announcing_100x_leveraged_daily_bitcoin_futures/cvxmllc).\n\nUnlike our competitors, we publish the projected loss percentage in real-time, per contract. What you would see in the case of a massive movement would depend very much on its speed and available liquidity. If liquidity were lacking, one would expect to see the [DPE](https://www.bitmex.com/app/dynamicProfitEqualisation) indicative % rise as liquidation orders hit the market and go into the red. You would see the indicative % decrease on retraces as liquidation orders are able to be closed, in or out of the red.\n\nIn the worst-case, at settlement, liquidation orders would be settled at the mark price and the indicative DPE % would reflect that.\n\nAccepting that profits are capped in a high leverage contract is fundamental to understanding the contract. It is a contract that, at its face, offers unlimited upside and limited downside. We work hard to make the upside as large as possible, but it must have limits.': 3, "What's the point with 100x when there's little liquidity in the markets, sure you might 100x your money but then have to end up giving back 95% due to clawbacks from margin calls, ends up not being worth the risk. ": 2, 'Sorry /u/SoS_karti, at this point we cannot service any US customers. If that changes in the future we will make an announcement.': 3, 'Jesus': 3, "Someone online was saying they just used Private Internet Access VPN and use European IP and was able to sign up and deposit BTC and also withdraw it.   I doubt BitMex cares if you do that as long as they have plausible deniability.\n\nThe only risk is that in the future, they could press for documents to verify your identity.  But at this point, it's not in their best interest to do that, so you are probably ok.   \n\nBut the VPN route does seem to work, so up to you if you want to use their site or not, regardless of where you are.": 6, 'Exactly that - 100x and 50x are maximum allowable leverage, you\'re not forced to open positions at 100x. Users are free to use cross margin, which is the default. \n\nWe have restricted 100x to the daily contract to limit potential losses and to give us the ability to adjust the leverage as needed if losses become unacceptable.\n\nAs for a massive liquidation, our market does not handle liquidations in the same way as, say, OKCoin or Bitfinex. On those markets, liquidation cascades are possible if not the norm in highly volatile times. A large market order created by a user going bankrupt can cause the momentum to accelerate, creating more liquidations and more market orders.\n\nWe use a mark price system that prevents this. Margin calculations are always done on the underlying index price, not the last price. A cascade is impossible; you\'ll only see large swaths of liquidations if the index price makes large movements, but liquidations themselves will never be the cause of more liquidations.\n\nWe also have an extremely fast, atomic trading engine. All positions and trade data are kept in the same engine and can never get out of sync. This makes problems like the infamous "Close Position" issue on Bitfinex completely impossible, by design.': 9, 'Any plans to serve US customers, perhaps from specific states?  I just signed up for nothing :/': 1, "You are correct that OKCoin now rebalances weekly. The only difference I can see between our rebalance and theirs is how long it takes (ours takes milliseconds, their takes up to 10 minutes). Our trading engine also smartly manages liquidation orders - I can't speak to how it's done at OKC, but we use a number of heuristics to determine when the engine should keep the order at the liquidation price, and when it should aggress them against the book in order to realize a small gain or loss.\n\nYou are also correct about profitable bankruptcies offseting other bankruptcies. This is also similar to OKCoin. We are working on exposing more transparency around that process.\n\nOverall there are a lot of similarities between the two systems. Feel free to ask if you have any more questions. And I hear you re: the FAQ and our References sections - we could probably condense some of that information, but we like to have all the *exact* information available to our traders. It's important to have as much information as possible in order to make smart decisions in a market.": 2, "Trying to understand how this works.\nSay someone wants to buy $1 million of bitcoin using $10,000 of their own funds.\n\nWhere does the extra $990,000 come from?  Is BitMEX loaning the money or some other institution?\n\nIf the value of the buyers investment drops 30%, then when the buyer owes $290,000 (and naturally can't pay it!) who actually ends up $290,000 in the hole?\n\nIt's real money, real debt, and not getting paid.  What am I missing?": 2, 'REKT': 7, 'Why stop at 100x?  ': 1, "You guys increased your futures leverage from 25x to 100x in a short period of time during a time where BTC has low volatility. So your exchange have not really experienced a massive margin call across users. Whatever risk management engine you implement is not user tested. Your confidence in your system is one thing, but you are in uncharted territory now.\n\nI have no idea why you would keep increasing leverage when you don't have the full BTC volatility data. Such quick change in leverage policies is irresponsible and foolish.": 15, "wait i thought bitmex was supposed to be different than the chinese exchanges? is this not hypocritical?\n\ncan someone explain why okcoin banned us customers and now bitmex done so too?? i didn't see any news.": 2, 'I see. So you still do have "socialized losses", but you publicly say how bad they will effect users (by showing the DPE %). I was curious because you must have a way of handling large liquidation orders when markets move quickly. However, I believe you stated that you rebalance long-term contracts every week as a "advantage"? I believe okcoin does this as well (I can\'t speak for other sites such as BitVC or 796 however). If any outstanding liquidations are still in place once settlement comes by for that week, they are moved to the current spot price as a limit order instead of where that position was liquidated. This allows people to much more easily reach and close out that liquidation. However, you must adjust the cost of moving that order by (for lack of better term) socializing the loss of moving the order. At the end of the day, don\'t both of you do this?\n\nI also see here:\n\n>If BitMEX is able to liquidate the position at better than the bankruptcy price, the additional funds will be used to offset losses on other bankrupt positions. If there are not bankrupt positions to offset, the leftover Bitcoin will be used to offset losses in the next contract.\n\nThis looks similar to the OKcoin insurance fund, where a small portion of the liquidated position is added to an insurance pool that protects against socialized losses. Am I correct? If so I LOVE this feature, it enacts a tax upon the users who are causing the socalized losses in the first place. they have almost completely eliminated clawbacks since they introduced the system in BTC contracts, though LTC is still volatile enough to be not that effective.\n\nI don\'t see that many differences in the endgame of how your systems manage the risk if I\'m understanding things correctly? I personally like the way this style of futures performs, at least with my trading experience in BTC markets. Especially the insurance fund and the re-balancing of outstanding liquidations on longer term contracts.\n\nThank you for the answer though, and holy hell that FAQ is very very in depth. Lots and lots of information there. I think you guys have developed a platform that, if OKC ever were to go under, many many of the users on there would migrate over to you guys. The reduction of counterparty risk that futures offer is simply too valuable to make me go back to Bitfinex or other spot exchanges.': 4, 'So have you considered a worse case scenario of having many thousands of bitcoins leveraged long on 100x futures when the price suddenly explodes upward from a giga-whale buying?  \n  \nWhat will happen then?

So this means that regardless of how much /u/memorydealers huffs and puffs FUD about an exchange's solvency it really has little effect on me because 5/6ths of my coins are in cold storage.\n\n**Is 100x too much though?** -- as a self proclaimed degenerate gambler I have to agree with /u/lowstrife on this one and offer out the solution even. I don't have a problem with 100x if I can get in and out with size easily so this is why I have been suggesting to BitMEX to just go full CFD similar to what [http://www.simplefx.com](https://simplefx.com/?sfx-r=f0d58857-a2ac-4053-9a91-b88623df6a88) does on these highly leveraged products. Yes there will be a spread but the spread is where I **absolutely know** where I can get in/out and what P&L that will be. Front end liquidity and certainty for users then is **FULLY KNOWN** and it is up the backend to effectively hedge off risk and produce revenue within the spread. \n\nTLDR: if I don't have liquidity certainty (or near certainty like on OKC) then I can't bring myself to trade such high leverage": 7, "Yes - this is the fundamental problem with any 24 hour market that offers limited downside and unlimited upside. Unlike traditional markets, we cannot come after customers for owed funds.\n\nThis is where [DPE](https://www.bitmex.com/app/dynamicProfitEqualisation) comes into play. In the event of extreme market volatility, profits would simply be capped to the amount of available funds in the system. Winners would still do quite well, but not as well as they would in a truly uncapped market. Yet this system is a net win for all users, as the market survives - and so do users' funds. Accepting this upside capping is fundamental to trading on this type of market.\n\nThis is the reason why higher leverage is restricted to short-term contracts only, where the volatility - and the potential losses - will be limited by expiry.": 3, 'Thanks /u/imog, I appreciate the show of support.': 5, 'how about liquidity ?

I can see a zero sum factor applying to some degree when a person buys for the purpose of spending and the merchant converts back. I think this dampening affect is negligible when compared to other factors (miners selling, market manipulators, user speculation). If merchants did hold on to some, this would have a double affect of loosening the dampening that is present and would likely have the domino affect of introducing others to bitcoin ("if my employer can still maintain the companies survival then it might be safe enough for me to use too").

So if there any hypothetical selling pressure is very minimal. \n\nSecondly, this is a dynamic system, not a point observation of a transaction. If the latter was the case, yes, of course you're right. However, most someone had to buy those coins to use them - they're likely buying more. I autobuy coins whenever I spend them on retail commerce, both to keep my position stable and to make my purchases volatility - neutral. That way, when I buy bitcoin at the same time I use it, I take no price risk and take advantage of discounts. Perhaps theoretically, there is someone somewhere who uses e-commerce to reduce their long position in bitcoin - but that is a ridiculous strategy. If you're trying to trade, you'll go make a trade, not buy a bunch of shit off of Amazon.\n\nThirdly, retailers use payment processors. It's their job to sell the bitcoin for customers, so they're very precise about it. This leads them to hedge effectively based on what they're looking for, and take out some combination of longs, futures or derivatives to counter the sale to reduce their risk exposure. Which leads me to my next point... \n\nFourthly - they have a (relatively) stable bitcoin flow. They know coins are coming in, so they can take out derivatives and hedge into the future. While retail volume is low as fuck relative to miners, the same concept applies. We know miners are going to generate x coins per day, and the same is somewhat true for payment processors. Because it's known activity and not a shock, they revert to step 3. If your question was about miners selling pressure, it might be slightly more interesting, but the same ideas here would apply. \n\nFifthly - related to point 4 on information symmetry and point 2 about dynamic systems, there is the network effect. Not every retailer sells 100% of their btc. Remember, any single shop is getting a stupidly low dollar volume of BTC relative to their total revenue anyway. Some keep a tiny bit, some, or all of it. So it's not as simple as a bitcoin in and bitcoin out for retailers. \n\nFifthly, and again on the dynamic network point, money is just a human-made tool. If more retailers accept bitcoin, bitcoin becomes more useful - this increases demand and far outweighs any theoretical selling pressure. \n\nTLDR: No. There are several reasons retail commerce doesn't affect price, but those are all moot points because retail volumes are low as shit.

I believe BTC is something unique, and has great potential but I don't see why any sane merchant would primary rely on BTC as an asset. ": 1, 'Only going to talk about 3). Might come back to the other questions later if I have more time:\n\n>Does the fact that many transactions probably come from merchants who pretty much automatically convert to fiat (they do not speculatively hold) explain the apparent dampening effect we are seeing?\n\nAgreed on the premises (1. most merchants convert most of the btc txs to USD, EUR etc., 2. This has *some* dampening effect on price, obviously), but not agreed on your conclusion, in the sense that I get the impression you (a) overestimate the effect of this selling pressure in the overall market, and (b) you fail to mention another variable that, even if merchants converting to USD depresses price, has a positive impact on price as well.\n\n(a) follows from the observation that, overall, merchant transactions don\'t seem to make up a substantial portion of the overall tx volume of the network yet. From what we know about the biggest payment providers (like bitpay), this type of volume only accounts for a small part of the total tx volume in terms of USD (for example, Bitpay had 100M USD volume in 2013 vs. 20M USD tx volume *daily*.). Tx volume obviously isn\'t trading volume, but they are likely related (by underlying variable network size), and a similar argument can be shown to hold given the exchanges volume vs. merchant volume.\n\nIf you want to include other merchants that accept BTC \'natively\', then I\'m not so sure anymore premise 1. (most merchants convert) applies with equally high likelihood (i.e. they\'re more likely to hold onto the coins, otherwise, why wouldn\'t they use bitpay which allows conversion to USD automatically).\n\nOn (b): You don\'t seem to consider that increased usage for commercial transactions increases *selling* pressure (under the assumptions that merchants convert, mostly), but also adds to increased *buying* pressure (unless you assume that all commercial interactions are coming from \'early miners/hoarders\', which isn\'t supported by reality -- linear cumulative days destroyed doesn\'t match the increased usage for commercial transactions, and it is quite unlikely every single SR-clone user is an old miner, for example).\n\nConclusion: You\'re not wrong that merchant conversion adds selling pressure, but you seem to overestimate its effect on the market, and you should consider the converse of additional buying pressure as well. The bear market drags on -- or perhaps: the market stagnation continues for different reasons mainly. By my own reasoning, it\'s mainly due to technical reasons (i.e. huge bull market, or "bubble" eventually must end), and by a decent, but not spectacular increase of global adoption / network size.': 7, "Right.

They are all tied together to a ship in icy waters.\n\nThe most likely scenario is just the opposite of your quote above.

If there's one thing bitcoin has shown it's that it's not good at being a currency.  Merchant acceptance is down, of the merchants that do use it as a currency, usage is down.  It's a complete joke to use at a brick and mortar store, and not so hot to use online either.  It may have some niche uses for privacy purchases like VPNs, porn, or gambling, but for mainstream use a credit card is better for a variety of reasons.  So how bitcoin force banks to provide reasonable services?  As far as I can tell bitcoin isn't in any sort of competition with banks at all.

As far \nas volume goes, it has been operating pretty far above the market \naverage. Two of the major reasons for this are margin trading and the \nsize of its user base of active traders. Below are a list of reasons \nwhy Bitfinix is fundamentally an unfair comparison to Gemini:\n\n1) Traders are using leverage at Bitfinex\n\n2) Bitfinex's exponential growth in volume doesn't really start until the last two weeks.\n\n3) Bitfinex has been around a long time \n\n4) this is a hyped period where earlier adopters still have an large \nmarket advantage because of their pre-existing position\n\n5) The following table:\n\n\n3 day period # | Total volume BFX | Total Volume % increase BFX| Total Volume Gemini | Total Volume % increase Gemini\n:--|--:|--:|--:|--:\n1| 13815||127|\n2| 26818|194.12%|192|151.58%\n3| 42342|157.88%|1149|596.41%\n4| 69091|163.17%|458|39.90%\n5| 52297|75.69%|1112|242.65%\n6| 69809|133.49%|1099|98.81%\n7| 79591|114.01%|2254|205.09%\n8| 157018|197.28%|3995|177.17%\n9| Incomplete Period |||\n(Volumes floored)\n\nAdmittedly, the third point cuts both ways, but much more so for BFX as \nuser don't have to spend nearly two weeks to get their accounts funded \nand operating on the exchange. also, the fifth point shows similar \ngrowth for the last two weeks.

While BFX does have a rate of \ngrowth that is similar it has the advantage of using leveraged trades \nin a bull market with an existing client base. Even with vast market \ndominance over Gemini we can see that Gemini is able to grow more \nrapidly than any other exchange in a bull market. I argue that this \nshould not be the case and that Gemini is going to become much more \nsubstantial in the USD marketplace soon.\n\n\nEdit: Thank you for the gold!!!": 19, "Please don't get hit by a bus.

You put Bitcoin in and get those Mavros. Now these Mavros have an interest of 20 % ore more (if you do things like post on Facebook about it or stuff like that).\n\nThese Mavros entitle you to get "help" yourself.

What are the disadvantages in doing so? ': 1, "Can you please expand on your question. If my understanding is correct, your problem is that even though your tradable balance has increased due to your unrealized PL, you can't use that unrealized PL towards a LTC/USD position correct? \n\nThe problem is that PL is unrealized, and thus can only be used in that position.

I\'ve posted over at /r/bitfinex/ already but seems there are more helpful users here so I\'m going to copy and paste what I\'ve written over there to here.\n\n\nI\'ve always traded Bitcoin on Exchange, buying low selling high, like many others I\'ve heard about Margin Trading allowing you the ability to Short Bitcoin in a downtrend market.\n\nI understand the concept and the potential risks involved with being liquidated with Margin Trading.\n\nWhat I\'m having trouble with it the actual platform itself.\nI\'ve looked through the FAQ\'s / Guides on the website itself, but cannot find any "clear" and easy to understand guides for some of my questions, so hopefully someone here can help.\n\n1 - Where do I change my leverage option? I don\'t necessarily want 3.3:1 (at least not for now whilst I\'m learning the platform).\nI read on the Announcements page that there has been a change in how you select leverage, something to do with %\'s, but I\'m not sure where to find this option or how it actually works now.\nSelecting 1:1 / 2:1 / 3:1 is obviously quite easy, so am I missing something with %\'s? All the video guides I can find online appear to be prior to this change.\n\n2 - How do I create an order, with either a stop-loss or a trailing stop-loss?\nThis is how I assume it works, but in practice with a .01 BTC order last night, left open all night to test, it did not close when I had hoped it would.\n\nFor simplicity, lets assume BTC price is at $100 even. I\'m on Margin Trading > BTCUSD\n\nI think price will go down, but not sure how far before coming back up, so I want to open a Short Position with a Trailing Stop, meaning I buy at $100, with a Trailing Stop at say Price Distance of $2 (meaning my stop-loss should start at $102 and stay $2 behind price when price moves).\n\nPrice goes down to $90 (so I\'m happily in profit), Trailing-Stop should now be sitting at $92, so if Price starts to reverse and goes back up to $92 my order should close itself.\n\nThis is how I understand a trailing stop to work. So last night, I opened a long position, with a trailing stop distance of $1.18 I got up this morning to find that the price had in fact dropped by $5, but my order was till open. I\'m not sure why.\n\nCan someone give me a really basic guide to both of my points above?\n\n1 - How do I change what leverage I\'m using (Ideally I want like, 1.5 or something, certainly not 3.3 until I know how to use the platform properly and use trailing stops or stop loss).\n\n2 - How to open either a long or a short position (at market price or limit price) and how to have a "working" trailing stop?\n\nThank you in advance.': 1, 'Sorry for the late reaction didn\xe2\x80\x99t see your post. From what I understand you can\xe2\x80\x99t actually set the leverage ratio yourself, its automatically 3.3:1 if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want use full 3.3 then make sure you don\xe2\x80\x99t long or short more than your desired amount of leverage. Let\xe2\x80\x99s say you have 10 BTC then with leverage you\xe2\x80\x99ll be able to open positions worth roughly 33 BTC. You have to calculate yourself how much leverage corresponds to your desired ratio. You can see how much you can use in total in your Tradable Balance. \n\nNow to open a long position you use the margin buy side and to open up a short you use the margin sell side. Now to set a trailing stop you need to make sure you put the trailing stop at the opposite side of your position. Say you want a trailing top on your long position then you open up a trailing stop with the margin sell button. If you want to use a trailing stop on your short position you open up a trialing stop with the margin buy button. Problem might be that you put a trailing stop at the same side as your position so you set a trailing stop with the margin buy side instead of the margin sell side for you long position. It\xe2\x80\x99s the same for stop orders, make sure you use the opposite side. \n': 2}, ('2013 vs. 2015 - Just for the fun of it', 137): {'[deleted]': 0, "We're climbing about as fast as we did in November 12 or so 2013": 2, 'in this case scientificum statisticum was the driver of the OP.

Also, it\'s a low frequency trade, so you\'re going to vulnerable to broader market regimes. This is why your short positions do so much better than your longs. W/L ratio and winrate look good though.\n\nTo get into specifics:\nYou\'re showing a max drawdown of 23% in under two years -- how often would that happen? \n\nThe kurtosis in your returns is *huge*. Your worst trade was ~10x your average *losing* trade. Your best trade was ~5x your average *winning* trade, which not only is a really heavy tail but the difference could indicate an overall negative skewness that just hasn\'t been expressed because of variance/luck. Combined with the fact that you had 9 consecutive losing trades, it would be an understatement to say that the scale of your return profile is important to determining if you\'d go bust. What\'s the probability that the next 9 trades you make each lose 10+%?\n\nYour entries/exits are bad: on average, you\'re giving up ~3x your average profit by not closing out earlier according to your ETD. And in NT that includes your losing trades! You\'re also clearly carrying big unrealized losses consistently with an MAE like that. This trade-off is what would probably sink you because I\'d guess you can\'t reduce variance or recover those unrealized profits without taking on many more losses. It\'s the curse of the "wait and see" trading style where you need a future indicator value/signal to determine your exit price.

If this were real life, the next step would be to ask you to come back with sensitivity analysis on your signals. I would also need you to run it on positively trending market regime.

So sarcasm. ': -1, '[deleted]': 1, 'To be clear, there is no "ruling". There was simply a re-posting of an article on a Chinese government website the same week there was a somewhat major blockchain summit. \n\nThings in China are very tightly controlled, so the article would not have been re-posted without authority. Any re-posting of a positive bitcoin article on a Chinese government website is viewed as a step in the right direction in our opinion. \n\nThere has also been a slew of other positive news about bitcoin from China - http://www.coindesk.com/china-wanxiang-blockchain-50-million-fund/\n\nThe "China Unbans Bitcoin" is a play on a common meme here from years ago. \n\nOverall, the goal was to expose westerners to what might be going on outside of their bubble. It is unlikely that many knew about the blockchain summit outside of China. ': -1, 'I don\'t have time to do a full translation, but here are a few remarks after tracking down the original article.\n\nThe original article, titled *"The Post-Bitcoin Era": Digital Currency Oversight on the Agenda*, appears to be an editorial by Yang Tao that first appeared on People\'s Daily, often considered a party mouthpiece.\n\nThe People\'s Daily often publishes **unsigned** editorials that most people view to be official party statements. The **signed** editorials, on the other hand, can take other, non-official stances, as long as they are within a range deemed agreeable by censors and officials.\n\nYang Tao seems to be a financial reporter who writes a lot about Bitcoin, with some of his previous articles appearing on People\'s Daily as well. \n\nThe article is not about un-banning bitcoin. It\'s about banks in the US and Europe looking into the use of blockchain technology as a protocol for transaction verification. It states that China may do well to look into this as well.\n\nAs we know, many big US banks are looking into blockchain tech, but they all seem to want to do it without bitcoin. Seeing all the qualifiers about money-laundering and instability in the original article, I\'d say Yang Tao is raising this as a possibility for Chinese banks.\n\nDon\'t go out and get a bunch of long positions because of this. If the central bank really were seriously considering a change in bitcoin policy, we would be seeing huge jumps in the Chinese market, because there\'s no way to keep it entirely under wraps. I\'m seeing Chinese forums scratching their heads about this as well.\n\nAlso, the "Ma" that keeps turning up in your google translate links is \xe5\xa4\xae\xe5\xa6\x88, which roughly translates to "Mother Central." It seems to be a slang term for the central bank.': 21, 'Take a look at this link as well for more context: https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&hl=en&rurl=translate.google.com&sl=zh-CN&tl=en&u=http://8btc.com/thread-23876-1-2.html\n\nThe Chinese already seem afraid of what this regulation that "Ma" created will bring.

The spread between Bitfinex and Huobi has gone from ~0% one month ago to over 3% today.  The spread peaked around the 17th of October when it was 8% for a short while.  \n\nThis can't be explained just by people using BTC to move money out of China, because that has been possible for the past 2 years+.  There would need to be a massive shift in the capital flight from china using BTC in the last month for this to make sense.  \n\nAnother possible reason for the Chinese BTC pump lately could be their weak stock market performance.  The SHCOMP:IND got beat up this summer, and there aren't many options for Chinese investors to store their wealth.  It could be that BTC gained traction as people are less trusting in their stock market.\n\nIt could be that this ruling has been hyped up within the Chinese BTC community as well, although the release only hit the press on October 13th.  We notice the spread between China and US markets was relatively flat for the 2 days after 13th of October.  Instead, the spread has a huge spike on October 16th, reaching a climax on October 17th.  \n\nI'd be nervous about the Chinese government discussing Bitcoin at all.  Bitcoin really goes against all of the capital controls in place in the country.  Any official stance by the government will not be friendly to Bitcoin.  It seriously undermines the Chinese systems that restrict money entering and leaving the country.  \n\nThere is no way China will officially endorse Bitcoin.": 0, 'We never suggested that this was from the PBOC or anything of the sort.

Can you give your thoughts on how you feel about the effect of Bitcoin\'s distribution pattern on Bitcoin\'s outlook? I\'m referring to that not only is Bitcoin the first cryptocurrency (existing for 7 yrs), it is also purely PoW (thus letting anyone earn/mine bitcoin), has a gentle money supply increase curve (to prevent only early adopters from being able to enter at reasonable prices), and had no IPO or premine or instamine or ICO (that distributed large amounts in a single go, to few people). This is in contrast to coins like Ethereum, Dash, Bitshares, etc. Do you think this nature of Bitcoin lends it more credibility via the greater distribution, such that it\'s more plausible to imagine significant amounts of capital to choose to gradually buy into it and adopt it? Basically, I argue that because it has had a "fair" and "long" distribution process, it is far more plausible to imagine it becomes longterm #1 vs. any potential competitor.

Now he\'s lined up a group of big-name backers to support the launch of a conglomerate devoted entirely to bitcoin and other blockchain technologies.\n\nIt\'s called Digital Currency Group (something that already existed in a much more modest form), and will include a pair of businesses that were originally formed at SecondMarket, but were not part of the sale. They include Genesis Global Trading, an over-the-counter bitcoin trading firm; and Grayscale Investments, a digital currency asset management firm that manages the Bitcoin Investment Trust, a publicly-listed vehicle that raised over $60 million.\n\n\n\nIt also will house a portfolio of 57 seed-stage investments that Silbert and his team have already made, including Chain, Circle, Coinbase, Ripple and Xapo. They also have backed several companies looking to exploit bitcoin\'s blockchain technology for uses outside of finance, including Ascribe (managing digital IP) and ShoCard (digital identification). Using CoinDesk data and other public sources, Silbert estimates that the companies he\'s made early investments in have gone on to raise nearly 70% of all venture capital that has been pumped into the bitcoin and blockchain markets.\n\n"What we\'re building is the largest early-stage investment portfolio in the digital currency and blockchain ecosystem," Silbert explains. "We\'re also going to start high-growth businesses of our own, and develop a global platform and network to support our companies."\n\nDGC is structured as a company rather than as an investment vehicle, in part because Silbert hopes to someday take it public. To that end, he has raised what he refers to as a "very large" new round of funding.\n\nAmong the new investors is MasterCard, which seems to be making its first formal foray into the bitcoin space. The others are: Bain Capital Ventures, CIBC, CME Ventures, FirstMark Capital, New York Life, Novel TMT, Oak HC/FT, RRE Ventures, Solon Mack Capital and Transamerica Ventures.\n\n"We\'re still far away from bitcoin being a functional currency, and I don\'t think we\'ve gotten closer lately," Silbert says. "First it\'s going to function as a speculative investment that will drive up the price and create a larger monetary base that will draw in Wall Street to trade it. Then more merchants will come on board. As it gets more liquid, as a [payment] rail it will become a real alternative to the existing money transfer systems in the world today.

This was obscured by the fact that Kraken primarily traded BTC/EUR and Bitstamp was doing BTC/USD, so price-differences weren't easy to spot.\n\nI would send EUR to Bitstamp which would convert it to USD (at quite a reasonable rate too) to add to my account. My BTC would be at Kraken and when the time was right, I would buy on Stamp and sell on Kraken. After funds would dry up, I would transfer BTC around, withdraw the EUR to my bankaccount and make a new deposit on Bitstamp.\n\nAfter a short while, I automated the trading component by creating a small program in C#/.NET to poll prices on both exchanges and perform trades when the expected profit-margin exceeded a certain threshold. All I had to do is send funds around and keep track of earnings in a spreadsheet.\n\nIn total, this process has earned me about EUR 4000-5000, never using more than 10K per deposit (most deposits / withdrawals were between 2K and 6K). Despite individual deposits not being very big and essentially reusing the same money over and over, in total I did move around several hundred thousand of EUR in total volume. My bank got suspicious about this amount of money coming from foreign account A and going out to foreign account B through my regular bank account that never saw more action than simple salary -> expenses. So they asked me to clarify what I was doing, but once I explained it (with screenshots of deposit/withdrawal histories at exchanges), they said it was fine.\n\nThe trading I did was the very simplest form of arbitrage.

I get a good sized group of locals to form a group. In China, we arbitrage when the difference in exchange rates are large enough (usually 3-is percent or so). A small group buys or sells in one exchange, transmits the money or btc to Taiwan. Then the group in Taiwan uses about half that to buy or sell on the exchange in China and the other half is sent via traditional and shadow-banking to the group in China. They buy or sell as well on the exchange in China. Then the money is funneled back out the opposite way. Ultimately it ends up back in my bank in the US (minus my group's fees) via my business partners (usually in Taiwan).\n\nThat's how I do it (except for the finer details). And it is super awesome lately. When the gap closes we go back to traditional trading individually but we share algo's.\n\nTl;dr - It is much easier if you have locals in Asia who you trust and have the ability to send /receive fiat. Chinese are very used to Shadow Banking so they are not as opposed to such relationships.": 10}, ('New Features on BitMEX: Adjust Isolated Margin, IOC Close Limit, Performance Updates, and Adjusted Withdrawal Cutoff', 3): {'Did you close the volatility contracts ?': 1, 'Start with Options so you can actually judge vol.': 2, "Thanks!

To do this please go to settings ---> user preferences and enter your wallet address under the return address field.\n\nI'll be honest, CAVIRTEX is lagging in terms of recent developments and improvements. That said, it still works and there are some great opportunities for arbitrage and gains. \n\nOne last think to know about for new users: there is a 14-day hold on withdrawals for new accounts.  This is in place to prevent fraud. I know that when the price is moving like this it sounds like an eternity and it kills arbitrage opportunities However, once the 14 days elapse there will never be any other holds. \n\nIf you want to email me directly i'm kylek@cavirtex.com. \n\nThanks, \n\nKyle": 2, 'They fucked me over before too.
