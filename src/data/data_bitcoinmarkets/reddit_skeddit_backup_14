It would baiscally be game over for the exchange.  Everyone would pull their funds.\n\nOkcoin would do absolutely everything within their power to prevent this from happening, including borrowing bitcoin on onerous terms from whales in a private deal, said whales probably only agreeing if they have some additional assurance that the debt is payalble.  \n\nAs an aside, traders used the above argument to justify buying goxbtc, figuring "there\'s no possible way gox is bankrupt" and of course this turned out badly, because gox had actually been hacked.\n\nBut being hacked and being sleazy fucks who rip their own customers off is two different things.\n\nThe okcoin bitcoin is probably fine, barring a hack.\n\nBut that brings up the point of why haven\'t they done a proof of reserves since august?\n\nPoor business practices could be an indicator of other problems such as, well, not having good security, or planning an eventual exit scam, running off with customer funds and claiming "we were hacked!"\n\nSo, okcoin should update the fucking proof of reserves report.\n\nUPDATE: See update to my initial post.

What does them wanting to get away from Ripple have to do with anything, btw (given the entire Bitcoin community seems to hate Ripple with a passion)\n\n3) So, they operate bots. Those bots likely add liquidity to its markets, acting on the other sides of trades when there aren\'t customers who will take those positions. Same thing happens with market makers selling stock from inventory when there aren\'t other sellers (or buyers) be found, as well as with options in the equities markets. What exactly are these bots doing that is "wrong"?\n\n4) Same goes for this "Account 11".

When that money runs low, they need more transferred to their account. Again, then norm for financial institutions. Speculating that they\'ll clawback gains that clients made is an absurd speculation, I think. If they make losing trades, then doubtless it\'ll come out of of the firms principal, not from clients gains.\n\n3) Breach of confidentiality. One one hand you complain that they sent out an email CC\'s 10 institutional customer, allowing them to know who one another were. OK, fine. Errors like that happen. When I worked in wealth management, I\'d receive emails from hedge funds that cc\'ed all of their investors, got to learn the addresses of some pretty big names. Sometimes they\'ed send an email asking us to delete the previous email and replace it with the "correct" email (sent to a group, where we couldn\'t see the other members). Either way, no BIG harm in knowing who the customers are, it\'s not like they\'re emailing details on each others trades to one another.\n\n5) MORE disturbing is YOUR action. If them inadvertently CCing their customers (meaning that 10 institutional clients who each likely figures that the others are also using OKC) is such a big violation, fine. But you just told the entire world who one of those clients is. WTF? I have to say, that\'s an idiotic move, far worse than these supposed grievances.\n\n7) Why is Circle in violation of procedures in the US? Because OKCoin cc\'s emails? I don\'t get it.\n\n8) This COO stuff is wacko. Where is proof, or is this all heresy?\n\nAnd the complaint from the previous product manager, it seems to boil down to:\n\nOKC leases Bitcoin.com from Roger Ver for $10k per month. On top of that lease payment, apparently Mr Ver wants to have a piece of advertising revenue as well?!? As such, it sounds like Ver suggested that if they didn\'t want to advertise other peoples products, they could advertise their own, but apparently Mr. Ver wanted too much per eyeball (that\'s how I\'m reading the link you provided).\n\n>However, as Mr. Ver was incentivized to monetize the domain, \n>OKCoin was under constant pressure to fill Bitcoin.com with \n>advertisements in order to attempt to generate addition revenue >for Mr. Ver. These pressures to our shock even included offers to \n>redirect Bitcoin.com to our entities OKCoin.com and OKLink.com \n>for absorbent sums which we rejected in principle.\n\nAnd the disgruntled web designer posted to reddit to complain that OKC is complaing that OKC seems to have wanted 2 ads to OK Coin on the Bitcoin homepage, which seems to be inline with Ver\'s suggestion, and more so, seems like the entire reason for paying $10,000 to rent a domain name in the first place - why do you think anyone would pay $10,000 to rent a domain for a month, if not to use the domain as a tool to their benefit. So, the web designer quits because the CEO, who\'s paying $10,000 a month for this domain AND paying the designer himself, wants to be involved in the design of the page. What nerve? And he had the gall to ask to have two links to OKC on the page as well? OMG.\n\nWTF guys. Bitcoin.com isn\'t some domain run by a charity to better the domain ecosystem, it\'s a domain for which its already rich owner charges an astronimical amount of money for companies to rent. Of course they\'re going to use it as a tool for their advertising.\n\nMeanwhile, when I go to Bitcoin.com now, it takes me straight to Blockchain.info.  Is that the quality content that the designer hoped for? Does that add value to the Bitcoin ecosystem? \n\nFor comparison, when looking at the Bitcoin.com page from the November 2014 via the payback machine (here\'s the link): https://web.archive.org/web/20141119194510/http://www.bitcoin.com/ ) I see 4 distinct link to Blockchain.info, a link to ZeroBlock (a blockchain property), and if you click to be an advertiser, that too takes you to their site.\n\nMeanwhile, the wayback machines record of bitcoin.com from March 2015, the site seems FAR more informative and relevant to Bitcoin users, than it ever did when blockchain had it, let alone now that they have it back...\n\nI\'m force to speculate that Ver\'s agreements with lessors of his domain is that they pay $10k a month plus guarantee a huge additional amount from advertising or referrals. OKCoin seems to have made the site actualy be a little informative, but the designer huffed and puffed because they wanted ads on it, and meanwhile Ver took the domain back and gave to to Blockchain info to manage because they were more aggressive about monetizing it.\n\nTell me, am I crazy here? WTF am I missing? Or is this just a concerted effort to attack OKCoin for a reason that I can\'t fathom? Not that I need to fathom it, I\'m of no relation to them, but both of these sets of complaints seem either baseless or childish or both.\n\n': 3, "1) okcoin is shady as fuck\n\n2) however\n\nI actually don\xe2\x80\x99t see the problem with the bot accounts, in the context of a proof of reserves, given the following.\n\nThe proof of reserves shows there is at least > x amount of btc, for the accounts proved.\n\nIf OKCoin lied, but used bot accounts to cheat, they would just have to pay the excess out of the bot accounts, which hurts only themselves.\nassuming the bot accounts belong to okcoin.\n\nif bot accounts do not belong to okc, the counterparty at least knows there is cheating, which is an incentive not to continue the scheme.\n\n3) A more concerning actual issue is they haven't proven their reserves since August.  That's quite a while.  \n\nUPDATE:\n\nOn second thought the proof of reserves at OKCoin was not a cryptographic proof of reserve with merkle trees as described at https://iwilcox.me.uk/2014/proving-bitcoin-reserves.

In a market where many users are using bitcoin for payment, block rewards are insignificant.\n\nThere's no reason to think that a 3% fee is necessary either, currently the fee (as you view it) is *forced* to be 3%. It used to be over 10%, according to your logic, and even as the fee has greatly fallen, transaction volume has greatly increased.\n\nBut OK, perhaps you don't think transaction volume will be high enough.\n\nNote that if the sidechain fee is 0.1%, this can pay a miner more than bitcoin mining, as difficulty on these two chains is not equal. A low sidechain difficulty would mean less security, but since users are only using it for small amounts (value transmission primarily), this would be acceptable. There would be an equilibrium of security and fee tradeoffs on some sidechain that provides enough benefit for users to pay whatever the fee on that sidechain is.\n\nIt's also possible for a firm to come in, build a bitcoin POS terminal that uses a sidechain, shift fee payment to the merchant, and give merchants access to users that have bitcoins. The firm could mine the sidechain themselves, and collect fees from the merchants. User pays 1% fee, merchant discounts product at POS by 1%, user now effectively pays 0%. Most merchants are willing to pay a 1% fee given their more expensive alternatives.\n\n> bit-coin\n\nI'm thinking it would be easier for some people to take you seriously if you spelled the thing you're talking about correctly.

For miners to choose to mine the sidechain rather than the mainchain, the sidechain fees will have to be higher than the mainchain fees, because mainchain miners additionally receive block rewards.\n\nSince fees will have to be higher on the sidechain than the mainchain, users will always prefer to use the mainchain rather than the sidechain.

Any real accounting firm that would provide a REAL audit (not a audit that only describes half the picture) has experience in far, far more convoluted industries. Even calling what they have done so far an audit is quite disingenuous. A crypto only audit suffices ONLY for crypto-only exchanges such as 796. An exchange that deals in fiat MUST have that audited as well by a real accounting firm for it to mean anything. What happens when you are facing a crypto audit and are short 20k btc? Then you spend your fiat reserves to acquire those btc either OTC or, if you were forced to, from other exchanges.

The fact that a single satoshi is useful doesn't imply the price will continue declining because a satoshi is just as usable as 100 BTC.  Price isn't derived from that relationship.   I think you're mixing pure functionality/inherent value with value/worth/price.  You're sort of looking at it from a blockchain perspective and then attempting to put a value on BTC, if that makes sense.  Your first assumption clearly states that you only give value to BTC based on the fact that the underlying blockchain is valuable.  You're already at your conclusion before you even go any further than that.": 5, 'Well this is a pretty big & nebulous topic, so I apologize in advance if I run a little long.\n\n>where do you think the value of 1 BTC comes from then? In my mind, it has to be due to its functionality...which leads me right back to my initial post/point.\n\nThis is the Sixty-Four Thousand Dollar Question, my friend.  The answer is speculation.  \n\nPutting a valuation on BTC is a very difficult task that a lot of people have taken a stab at in the past.  However, at best they are educated guesses because there\'s really no tried and true method to valuing something like this.  Typically when you try to put a value on a company or commodity one would rely on a wealth of underlying fundamental data points as a start.  Modeling out past financials, analyzing year over year changes, and applying assumption to future years to arrive at an expected valuation some time in the future, and then people will take that a step further and discount the expected future value back to the current point in time to arrive at their estimated value.  That\'s a rough outline to "bottom-up" valuations.  But with Bitcoin, there are no financials.  There\'s no balance sheet, no statement of cash flows.  The underlying fundamentals become whatever measurable statistic we can come up with, such as # of daily transactions, # of wallets created at various wallet service providers, estimated transaction volume in fiat, and even the google search trends for "Bitcoin".  On top of the lack of hard fundamentals, the few statistics that I just rattled off are all pretty gameable.  Anyone could spam the blockchain with tons of tiny transactions, and anyone could create a bunch of unique new wallets, etc.  The crappy selection of "fundamentals" only becomes crappier in that light.\n\nHowever, where \'bottom-up\' valuations are basically impossible with BTC, the opposite \'Top-Down\' approach is not hampered by the lack of fundamentals. Top Down valuations are also better suited to Bitcoin because BTC is more of a commodity than a currency at this point in time.  The limited usability of BTC as a true currency is why I say that (in the future BTC will behave more like a true currency if your average business begins accepting BTC as a currency).  Whereas bottom up methodology looks more at the underlying fundamentals of BTC, top-down methodology would look at the global economy as a whole and ask "What industries are vulnerable to Bitcoin & blockchain technology?"  The obvious answer is money remittance, such as western union.  The analyst would then assess the size of the money remittance market and work on a good estimation for how much of that economic segment bitcoin could muscle in on.  There\'s no way to come up with 1 hard answer for that question though, so instead the analyst would likely present different ranges of market share and assign different probabilities for the various ranges.  Then once the analyst has gotten that far, they can start backing into the total market value of the money remittance market that Bitcoin could steal over a given amount of time (probably 2-5 years.  No analyst would limit themselves to only a year out, and most analysts wouldn\'t be comfortable going further than 5 years out in any estimates because it\'s a complete crap shoot guestimate).  Divide that by either the current number of BTC in the market, or you can remove that changing amount from the calculation altogether and go straight to the 21 million final tally as your denominator (this is the route I would go.  Just assume it\'s all been mined and all out there.  Builds in a margin of safety to the estimate implicitly).  There\'s your Top-Down valuation of 1 BTC.\n\nBut all of that is pretty much for naught because you have to apply a lot of very large assumptions in either of those valuation methodologies that you wouldn\'t have to do in a traditional valuation.  The more assumptions you have to make, the less reliable the outcome will be.  Assumptions = points where you\'ve introduced risk into your analysis.\n\nTo conclude & summarize, a bottom-up valuation is just about impossible because there aren\'t a good set of metrics to use as a basis for a bottom-up analysis of Bitcoin, and the few that do exist are all able to be manipulated without the general population knowing (without some studious blockchain crawling, at least).  A top-down valuation is more appropriate because of Bitcoin\'s nature as a commodity more than a currency currently.  However, many major assumptions have to be made in a top-down analysis, and I firmly believe that all the assumptions really hamstring the analysis in the end.  It\'s a broad estimate at best.\n\n>I get the limited commidity thing, but, is it \'limited\' when each BTC is really like a bajillion smaller* coins?\n\nYes, because while the coins are supremely divisible, the values of the amounts are still different.  A brick of gold is technically highly divisible too.  A brick weighs over 27 pounds, and I could cut it up into 1 ounce chunks.  The 1 ounce chunk is not worth the same as the entire gold bar.  Also, the value of BTC is constantly in flux depending on the supply and demand at various exchanges worldwide.  It\'s a 24/7/365 marketplace.  The importance of having BTC be highly divisible is in the situation where the price runs away from us and we\'re talking 5 figure prices per single BTC. That\'s when the divisibility is super helpful because you\'d only have to spend .0001 BTC to spend a dollars equivalent in fiat (at a $10K per BTC rate).  \n\nEdit:  And I didn\'t even begin to talk about the cost of mining BTC as a determinant of the value of BTC either.

I would love to use Kraken rather than Bitfinex, but there is no way I am going to upload scans of my passport or driver\'s license to a Bitcoin exchange -- they are worth far more than any amount I can deposit, and can\'t be verifably "unuploaded" once they are.\n\nEdit: for context, I was told the standard "but we keep this stuff really secure" by Bitcoinica one week before they got hacked out of existence -- so assurances mean nothing to me.': 5, "I was referring to this comment \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/36m574/kraken_launches_margin_trading_beta_with_3x/crfa54y\n\nI'm used to increase and decrease a position, not to open a new distinct position with his own leverage every trade.": 1, 'Holy shit thats scary in such a volitile market.': 1, "That's how forex margin works--your p&l is realized in the quote currency.

I think it\'s disingenuous to blame all these security requirements on your bank(s) though.  Are they seriously saying they will close your account unless every customer has ID stored? Are they in charge of your TierX policies?  I doubt it because those policies are different at different exchanges.\n\n> We\'re requiring Tier3+ for margin because there is potential for your account to go negative.\n\nYou don\'t want any accounts going negative, regardless of their security level.  Besides, why is Tier#3 any more of a protection against that?\n\nIf you were using a limit-based system, or a security-deposit during margin periods. then it would make more sense.  But you\'re not, you\'re denying margin for Tier#2.\n\nAlso: why does previous reputation not count?  Why, given that I\'ve sent bank transfers to you before, and you therefore have my source bank details, who in turn then have my address, and you have my address from me as well, _and_ those transfers have gone through with no trouble, months and months ago, with no "fraud" followups from the source bank, does that not count as a verification?\n\n>  Not even the biggest banks can guarantee you that they can keep your funds and identity secure.\n\nFortuntately not one of my banks has ever asked for (or received) a copy of my driver\'s license or passport.  So in fact, they are asking for less than you.\n\nI think banks, and you, forget which way the trust should, in theory flow.  _You_ are the ones holding my money, not the other way around.  AML/KYC laws have made everyone forget that those few criminals that are the purported targets of AML/KYC laws are _vastly_ outnumbered by the honest customers.  Bizarrely, I seem to be in the minority -- those honest customers should not, if they had any sense, be extending their trust in exchanges to the extent that the exchange requires the converse.\n\n>  I think it increases the counterparty risk of your funds (law enforcement crackdowns, seizures), but certainly, you have reduced counterparty risk for your identity, which might be more valuable.\n\nIt definitely is.  If someone steals from me via my deposit with you, they can get what I\'ve deposited with you, max.  If they steal my identity, they can, in theory get access to every bit of savings I\'ve got, and my entire personal credit.  Not to mention the time and hardship it would cause that I\'d have to sort out.  There is no "might" about it -- my identity is _always_ worth more than any mere money I might have deposited with you.\n\n> I\'m open to other ideas about how we might be able to extend margin to tier2 clients without the risk of them blowing up their accounts and leaving us with a negative balance.\n\nI honestly don\'t see how tier#2, or tier#3 prevents that.  They are orthogonal issues.  I could fully identify myself, and go negative -- how would tier#3 get you your money back?  You honestly think you\'re going to have any luck collecting a debt from a person three continents away, regardless of how sure you are of their name?\n\nIf I understand margin trading properly, the risk of "negative balances" comes from you not being able to force-close a position fast enough in a rapidly changing market.  That, if I may make so bold, is nothing to do with the customer, it is to do with shallow liquidity on your exchange.  Your solution to that?  _Reduce_ the number of traders with artificial "security" protections?  You\'ll forgive me if that doesn\'t sound like a way to boost liquidity.  Further, since it\'s the rapid change of the market that triggers the problem -- it\'s a situation that\'s completely out of the hands of the customer, and hence would affect tier#2 and tier#3 equally.\n': 2, "Hi, thanks for the feedback.\n\n I don't understand your first request.  Can you elaborate?  How is Kraken's system different?\n\nThe other two features are already in the pipeline :)": 2, "Thanks for the thoughtful post.\n\nTrust me--we're not doing it because we enjoy it.  Most exchanges are at the mercy of their bank, and banks are just trying to cover their asses by requiring extreme measures from the exchanges they service.  Banks are dealing with fraud, police, regulators, other banks refusing to transact or play intermediary.  One bank asked us to produce 35 documents just to open a basic operations account.  Upon providing 35 documents, they asked for another 25.  Does any of it matter?  No.  Is it unusual?  Yes.  Do we have a choice?  No.  They're just afraid of losing their whole business over a single, small account, and the same goes for us.\n\nPersonally, I understand the frustration.  There are a few exchanges that I used to trade on but stopped once they started asking for KYC docs.  I promptly withdrew all my funds because I did not trust them with my identity.  Fortunately, for the industry and privacy conscious people, there are exchanges out there which do not require any KYC.  I think their days are numbered and I wouldn't want to have my funds sitting with them when the shit hits the fan but if you can limit your financial exposure, they might be a good option.\n\nWe're requiring Tier3+ for margin because there is potential for your account to go negative.  Since we're taking that risk on the client, we would like greater certainty that we know who the person is.  Maybe a future workaround for this is a 3rd party multisig collateralization, though that is only helpful if you have extra funds that you're not keeping on the exchange.\n\nYou're right that assurances mean nothing.  Not even the biggest banks can guarantee you that they can keep your funds and identity secure.  Reduced/absence of AML/KYC is a competitive advantage right now but it's not something Kraken can win at.  I think it increases the counterparty risk of your funds (law enforcement crackdowns, seizures), but certainly, you have reduced counterparty risk for your identity, which might be more valuable.\n\nI'm open to other ideas about how we might be able to extend margin to tier2 clients without the risk of them blowing up their accounts and leaving us with a negative balance.": 4}, ('How will JoinMarket affect BitFinex swaps and shorting?', 7): {"Oh I couldn't care less about you taking advantage of the BFX news, just stating the obvious about your post so subscribers won't potentially be misled by your intentions.  \n\nSo your platform only mixes coins then?  and the liquidity providers are paid a small fee for providing BTC to facilitate the mixing?

With merge mined coins, you have to issue work restarts when either the primary coin gets a new block, or any of the coins you are merge mining gets a new block.\n\nScrypt is a memory intense algorithm.  The reason is that there are intermediate calculations that can be reused.  Scrypt ASICs are more expensive than SHA-256 ASICs, per MH, because you can either put a lot of logic gates to recalculate all these intermediate calculations for every hash, or you can store the first result for the intermediate calculation and then reuse it later for the same work.\n\nWhen you issue a scrypt work restart, the intermediate calculations need to be flushed because they are now useless.  Unlike SHA-256, that means that the most powerful ASICs take up to 1s to spin up to full hashrate.  There are ASICs advertised at "300MH/s" that actually deliver much less because the manufacturer is measuring top speed after all these calculations are ready, not the average speed the instant a new block is received until that block becomes stale.\n\nBack to economics: as a result of this delay, you only want to issue work restarts in Scrypt when the money to be made is greater than the money lost in doing nothing while the ASIC spins up.  This "work restart interval" can be measured by sending a few low-difficulty shares to miners and seeing how quickly they respond.  When a new primary block happens, of course, the amount of money to be lost is zero because the old block is stale.  However, when a new Dogecoin block or transaction comes in, dogecoins are 100 times less profitable than Litecoins, for example, so it doesn\'t make sense in most instances to issue a work restart to the miners.\n\nOur pool, and any optimal pool, does not tell Scrypt workers to restart mining when a new dogecoin transaction comes in, because miners lose far more money than the transaction fees in work restarts (unless those fees were very high, at least 2 cents per transaction).  Therefore, all of the dogecoin blocks we mine consist of whatever transactions were present when the primary coin had a new block, and all subsequent transactions are not mined.  That means that our dogecoin blocks are rarely full and the transactions we are ignoring have to be mined by someone else, or they get included when we get our next primary block.\n\nIn short, this sort of test would work fine for the litecoin network, but it won\'t prove anything that can be carried over to bitcoin on the dogecoin network.  The dogecoin network will surely back up, but the way that Scrypt ASICs work, combined with the nature of merge mining, will render the results meaningless for a coin that isn\'t merge mined.': 5, 'Long again at 225.5': 3, 'honestly the bitlicense release feels like a non event http://www.dfs.ny.gov/legal/regulations/adoptions/dfsp200t.pdf reads pretty much how i expected it to, "fairly permissive but they care how customer money is handled for for anti laundering and customer protection reasons" could summarize it..

This is the first true definition of the word "transmission" that I\'ve read in any bitcoin-related document, whether it be created by Lawsky or anyone else.  Prior to this, FinCEN stated that it was regulating businesses that "transmit" virtual currency, but it was not clear what that meant.\n\nThe critical issue I was waiting on and thought everyone would have to wait for a case to come up in court was what "transmission" means for this license.  When I logically think of the word "transmission," to me it meant that a business would be "transmitting" if a customer received payment in bitcoin - i.e. sending payment across the network.  If the term had not been defined, a large number of people would have had to wait for a court case to decide whether to do business in New York.\n\nBut since "transmission" is now defined as sending money "from a person" "to a person," a huge uncertainty has been eliminated.  This definition makes it clear that to "transmit" money, you need to be both receiving it from someone, and giving it to someone else, like Western Union does or an exchange does when it matches buyers with sellers.  People who are now able to do business under this definition include freelance job sites, businesses that settle their debts in bitcoin, mining pools, altcoin developers, and so on, because they do not receive customers\' money.\n\nWhile the license itself is generally not good news, what is good news is that they have clarified who is subject to the license and who is not.': 5, "not exactly...

If the difficultly ever stabilised it is vulnerable to a mining efficiency attack that de-stabilises it.

It\'s one of the quirks of capitalism that markets remain efficient only to the extent that people believe that they\'re inefficient, and liquid only to the extent that people are misinformed about an asset\'s value. To see why, imagine a perfectly efficient asset market with perfect information, where the goal of every participant is to maximize their financial returns. In such a market, all participants know everything that all other participants do, they know that all other participants know everything they do, and they can transact instantaneously without cost. Prices in this market converge instantly upon the "true" value, which can be agreed upon by all market partipants because of their omniscience. Such a market has zero liquidity. Why would anyone transact if they know that a security already has the correct value? For there to be profit potential, the person who sells to you must be misinformed about the security\'s true value, which contradicts the assumption of omniscience. The interesting thing is that the more market participants believe in the market\'s efficiency, the more inefficient it becomes. With little incentive to do their own research (why bother, when the current price reflects more information than they could possibly amass?), the underlying fundamental value of the asset can drift further from the consensus price without anyone noticing. This increases the profit potential for people who assume that they know better than everyone else. Eventually, a few of them get rich, the consensus breaks down, lots of people lose their shirts, and the market becomes efficient again. The result is the business cycle. Periods where people believe in the market\'s efficiency are bubbles (when the consensus price is above the true value) and panics (when the consensus price is below the true value). Periods when they don\'t are crises, where the prevailing momentum swings but this change in opinion is unevenly distributed. Lots of things fundamental to the modern world are unstable. The whole concept of a financial asset is one of them. I can think of a number of individual industries that have an unstable dynamic, but I\'m not going to name them because I believe there\'s profit potential in them. Public opinion is yet another one. \n\n[Source](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9575220)\n\n': 15, "ow damn. that is unfortunate. i will redo it on tomorrow's update :)": 2, '"bad actors" is just qualitative moralizing.

What to they all mean?', 5): {'Full Text of blog:\n\nWith Bitcoin entering the publicly, I think the community would benefit from a basic explanation of the different types of investment vehicles which they could potentially utilize to invest in Bitcoin.\n\nThe vehicles I\xe2\x80\x99ll touch on are as follows:\n\nOpen-end funds\nClosed-end funds \nExchange traded funds\nExchange traded notes\nOpen end funds \n\nOpen-end funds, better known as \xe2\x80\x9cMutual Funds\xe2\x80\x9d, are a staple of the investment world. \n\nAn open-end funds\xe2\x80\x99 shares don\xe2\x80\x99t trade among individual traders or investors, but instead are bought and sold in transactions directly with the fund itself. While orders can be placed at any point during the trading day, they only execute after the close of the trading day, after the funds manager or advisor has had time to accurately value the fund. In addition, shares only trade at the actual value of the funds assets (the Net Asset a Value or NAV). \n\nAn open-end fund is such because there is not a fixed number of shares in existence. Instead, the distributor creates or redeems shares in order to accommodate the buy and sell orders of its customers.   \n\nThe privately traded Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) is an example of an open end fund. However, while the fund can create new shares in response to purchases, the SEC has prevented them from redeeming shares. \nClosed-End Funds\n\nClosed-end funds are similar to open end funds in that each share typically represents a fractional holding of an underlying pool of assets. In contrast to open-end funds, closed-end funds have a fixed number of shares, and those shares traded among individual investors. \n\nThis means that shares of closed-end funds dont trade strictly at their NAV, but instead can trade at prices greater or less than their NAV (known as trading at a premium or at a discount),in accordance with market forces (supply and demand). \n\nThe publicly traded Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) is an example of a Closed End Fund. \nExchange Traded Funds (ETF\xe2\x80\x99s)\n\nETF\xe2\x80\x99s are a hybrid between open-end funds and closed-end funds. Like closed-end funds, they are quoted by exchanges and traded directly between investors throughout the trading day. But, like open-end funds, ETF\xe2\x80\x99s do not have a fixed number of shares. Shares are created in \xe2\x80\x9cbaskets\xe2\x80\x9d by Authorized Participants, which are entities that have pre-existing arrangements with ETF managers that allow them to create or redeem shares on demand. \n\nAuthorized Participants typically exercise their ability to create or redeem shares to arbitrage between ETF shares and the underlying assets. By taking advantage of mispricings between the two, Authorized Participants essentially guarantee that shares of an ETF will trade inline with the value of their underlying assets. \n\nAs an example, imagine XYZ ETF trades at $11 per share, while possessing only $10 per share of underlying assets. An Authorized Participant can buy up underlying assets, deliver them to the ETF, receive shares and sell those into the market, earning them \xe2\x80\x9crisk free\xe2\x80\x9d (or very low risk) money until the prices converge. \n\nOn the other side, if an ETF trades at a discount to NAV, the Authorized Participant will buy shares, redeem them from the ETF for the underlying assets, and sell those until the prices of the ETF and the underlying assets converge. \n\nThe Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust (COIN) is planned to be an ETF, though it is still awaiting SEC approval. \nExchange Traded Notes (ETN\xe2\x80\x99s)\n\nETN\xe2\x80\x99s are newcomers to the investment world, but a Bitcoin related ETN has been created, so it will be covered as well. \n\nETN\xe2\x80\x99s are derivatives of the issuer, possessing no underlying assets of their own. Rather than being distinct legal entities that own asseWhen you buy and ETN, you\xe2\x80\x99re buying an IOU from the distributor, where they promise to redeem those notes for the value of the asset they\xe2\x80\x99re tracking. \n\nTypically, the distributor will own the underlying assets in order to protect themselves if the prices rises, but holders of ETN\xe2\x80\x99s have no claim to those assets. So long as markets function normally, and the issuer remains solvent, ETN\xe2\x80\x99s should operate as promised, but they are subject to credit risk \xe2\x80\x93 if the issuer goes bankrupt, ETN holders would likely take a place among unsecured creditors. \n\nBitcoin Tracker One, which just began being quoted on Nasdaq Stockholm, is an ETN. \n\nrecap:\n\nBIT = open end fund. Privately traded, but prohibited from redeeming shares. \n\nGBTC = Publicly traded closed end fund. \n\nCOIN = planned to be a publicly traded Exchage Traded Fund. \n\nBitcoin Tracker One = publicly traded Exchange Traded Note.

Grexit would surely roil the capital markets and cause severe panic amongst investors. When in doubt sell everything and buy US Treasuries. That everything might include Bitcoin.

On the other side of this you have an inelastic supply of said storage space which can only drive transaction fees higher. Operations like Nasdaq will need to make sure they can actually store their data in the BC which gives them an incentive to offer higher fees. Miners will obviously have an incentive to prioritise these transactions. One 1 MB blocks every 10 minutes only creates 144 MB per day of storage space.

I loved the article ': 1, 'Full Text of Blogpost:\n\nYesterday XBT Provider AB a subsidiary of KnC Group (a large miner) launched the world\xe2\x80\x99s first ETN (Exchange Traded Note) with a Bitcoin underlying. Bitcoin Tracker One tracks the equally weighted Bitcoin / USD price on Bitfinex, Bitstamp, and OKCoin. The ETN trades in SEK on the Nasdaq OMX Nordiq.\n\nTrading volume on the first day went gangbusters. There is some confusion about how to convert the turnover figures listed into a Bitcoin equivalent number. On the exchange website, the turnover in SEK is listed, which was 1,837,196 SEK. Take this figure and divide by the price, 9.73 SEK to get shares. Approximately 188,817 shares were traded (it\xe2\x80\x99s approximate because the exchange lists turnover instead of shares traded). The ETN provider specifies that each share is worth 0.005 Bitcoin. Which means 944 Bitcoin equivalent shares were traded on the first day.\n\nBitcoin Equivalent = Turnover / Price * 0.005\n\nThe next crucial factor is the premium or discount to intrinsic value at which the ETN traded. The exchange closes at 16:15 GMT + 0 each day. The closing price was 9.73, the Bitcoin / USD price at that time was 236.54 Bitfinex, 236.45 Bitstamp, and 236.34 OKCoin for an average price of 235.44. The Bloomberg SEK/USD rate is 8.2348. That equates to a per share intrinsic value of 235.44 * 8.2348 * 0.005 = 9.69, and a 0.41% premium. That is tight, the market maker is doing their job correctly.\n\nWhy is GBTC\xe2\x80\x99s premium multiples of Bitcoin Tracker One\xe2\x80\x99s? The structure of an ETN allows the market maker to create and redeem shares at will to keep the premium or discount in line. GBTC shares cannot easily be created, it takes a minimum of one year to create new shares. It is also practically impossible to short GBTC. With an ETN, the market maker can have a negative inventory and at the end of the trading day create more shares to deliver to buyers within the settlement timeline.\n\nThis is indeed a very successful launch of a new ETN. As the broader market learns of the liquidity and affordability of this product, trading volumes should grow faster than that of GBTC. The only issue is that any holders bear KnC Group credit risk. But if the first day\xe2\x80\x99s trading is any guide, market participants are more than happy to shoulder that risk for an easier way to gain Bitcoin exposure.': 10, 'Great, detailed explanation.

He sells when the public is buying strongly, sending the market down, but not before he has unloaded. In doing this, he keeps the price confined to ranges after large moves to conduct his campaigns of buying and selling, and the action within the range builds a cause for the price to move out of said range. According to Wyckoff, it was important to figure out what the COs were doing at all times by analyzing the behavior of supply and demand within these ranges. It\'s very contextual analysis which generally avoids indicators. \n\nIn traditional markets COs are large syndicates, insurance companies, big hedge funds and central banks.

It is at this stage that careful analysis is warranted to determine if the decline is a secondary movement (a correction of the first leg up).

What happens to the Volume?\n\nthere's your answer.": 1, '2 reasons:\n\n- No fees make trades break even or profitable that otherwise would lose money. A break even trade on a fee based exchange only occurs if the trade can cover the cost of fees; on a no fee exchange, break even trades can occur for many different motivations by various parties with interest in the market.\n- Fraudulent activity. On behalf of the exchange or participants. Many use volume as an indicator, either for market liquidity or for the strength of movements.\n\nExample 1: If you can move the market X amount with a trade of Z volume, and there are no fees, you can also perform wash sales to yourself within that range so that you move the market by X amount on 5Z volume. The cost difference involved between that Z volume or 5Z volume is zero. If you believe higher volume of a move gets people to believe something specific, you can create it in attempt to control behavior of others, and profit.\n\nExample 2: Exchanges run an internal ledger, this is not public or trustless like the blockchain. If users deposit 9999999 bitcoins, the balance of all accounts should be 9999999 bitcoins... But the exchange could grant bitcoin to accounts out of nothing on their internal ledger, with no way for anyone outside to be aware. It is as simple as changing a single number in the database. Then that account with fake bitcoins executes trades, effectively putting those fakes into circulation while extracting real bitcoin from circulation. This would never be a problem, as withdrawals are honored with actual bitcoin... Unless everyone withdrew all bitcoins, then the exchange no longer had enough real bitcoin to cover all balances. In this example, bitcoin are taken directly from users but it looks like normal trading to everyone involved. You could instead just take bitcoin from a user account, but that would cause alarm with your users. By giving an account a fake balance however, you can then trade to take the balance of users, and they just think they made bad trades and its business as usual.\n\nA variation of example 2 is what occurred at mt gox.': 3}, ('While Rome burns whale club talks to BitMEX about their Futures/BVOL', 7): {"Why does that mean its shady though ?

I hope this isn't the case, for two reasons:\n\n* If they're actually being truthful, we'll get out money back eventually.\n* Knowingly trading while insolvent is a very serious **criminal** offence under the Corporations Act. Penalties are levied against company directors personally (i.e. they 'pierce the corporate veil'), and can include: $440,000 in fines, direct liability to compensate creditors, and up to 5 years imprisonment.\n\nEssentially, the directors of 13th Pty Ltd could be saps who find themselves bankrupt and in prison for simply being unaware (which is a shaky legal defence btw, as directors have legal obligations to remain informed about their company's financial position).  \n\nSome time this week I plan to write to the directors of 13th Pty Ltd (copying in ASIC), to make sure they **are** aware. This serves a dual purpose: it's possible they're being kept in the dark, and it means they cannot claim in subsequent criminal proceedings they were unaware of their company's financial position. \n\n": 3, 'I also had a really bad experience with IGOT.

They ended up finally sending my coins after I spammed the crap out of their Facebook and support system.\n\nThe ended up giving me an extra half a coin for the inconvenience. Small consolation for such bad service and a significant drop in the price. Their social media service was almost instantaneous. If only that level of service and response was extended to their other more important areas of operations. \n\nNote that they claimed it took so long due to "security".

All of this information is publicly available on the Australian Company Register.]\n\nSimilar situation here. I've been waiting for 15 days now for a bitcoin withdrawal (less than 2 BTC), have had numerous successful transactions in the past, depositing with the same bank account etc.  When I complained to their customer service after waiting a few days, they offered a refund, which I accepted. Since then, its been radio silence and no refund. No reply to my followup asking where my refund is.\n\nAt this point I'm pretty pissed off. The thing that really incenses me is that they are blaming this on 'system upgrades', but had not warned customers about these upgrades until some time after many (including myself) entered into transactions. And then they offer me a refund, but when I accept their offer, they begin ignoring me. I will never do business with company again (but I **will** be recovering my money, you can count on it). \n\nSome interesting facts and advice for those who find themselves in the same situation (**disclaimer, I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice**):\n\nOur EFTs go to a bank account owned an Australian company '13th Pty Ltd' (ACN: 160 051 990), so these transaction are subject to Australian Consumer Law (the [ATO classifies bitcoins as 'goods'](https://www.ato.gov.au/General/Gen/Tax-treatment-of-crypto-currencies-in-Australia---specifically-bitcoin/), rather than currency). \n\nI hope that /u/dan_igot is aware of these facts, and has made the directors of '13th Pty Ltd' (Amit & Shivani Taneja) aware of them too. If not, he may be interested to know that by omitting the fact that they were unable to supply within a timely manner, '13th Pty Ltd' have probably engaged in ['misleading or deceptive conduct'](https://www.accc.gov.au/publications/advertising-selling/advertising-and-selling-guide/avoid-misleading-or-deceptive-claims-or-conduct/misleading-or-deceptive-conduct) which is prohibited by [section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law](http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013C00620/Html/Volume_3#_Toc368657554). \n\nThere are some pretty good arguments that they have also breached more specific provisions of the Act too. For instance Sub-Section 36(3) of the ACL ('Wrongly Accepting Payment') states:\n\n> A person must not, in trade or commerce, accept payment or other consideration for goods or services if, at the time of the acceptance:\n>                     (a)  there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person will not be able to supply the goods or services:\n>                              (i)  within the period specified by or on behalf of the person at or before the time the payment or other consideration was accepted; or\n>                             (ii)  if no period is specified at or before that time\xe2\x80\x94within a reasonable time; and\n>                     (b)  the person is aware or ought reasonably to be aware of those grounds.\n\n/u/dan_igot may also be interested to know that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission doesn't go after people because they are 'big fish', but because the breach relates to a novel situation or a new 'wild west' market (reasoning that a big public example will deter future misconduct of the same kind). The penalties range from: \n\n* fines in the tens of thousands of dollars \n\n* director disqualification for long periods of time (i.e. can't start or run a company for 10 years)\n\n* up to criminal prosecution and imprisonment. \n\nOn an unrelated note, does Australia have extradition treaties with your current country of residence, or any countries you are likely to travel to /u/dan_igot?\n\nTo anyone in a situation like mine, here's my advice (keep all records and receipts btw):\n\n* First exhaust the possibility of resolving this through regular 'customer service' channels (like I have)\n\n* Write a ['complaint letter'](https://www.accc.gov.au/consumers/complaints-problems/write-a-complaint-letter) addressed to the directors of 13th Pty Ltd (Amit & Shivani Taneja). Send this letter, via **registered** snail mail to 13th Pty Ltd's 'principle place of business': 15A Ramsay Avenue, SEACOMBE GARDENS SA, 5047.\n\nIf this doesn't resolve the situation, you have the option of doing one, or any combination of:\n\n* Going to small claims court and getting (what will likely be) a 'default judgement' (basically a court order saying the company must pay you the money they owe). If they don't cough up (likely, given past experience), engage the South Australian Sheriff's Office to repossess property from their 'principle place of business' which can be sold to cover your debt and pay Sheriff fees.\n\n* Write letters of complaint to your State and the SA Offices of Fair Trading, who may commence investigations.\n\n* Write letters of complaint to the ACCC, who may consider the situation 'novel' enough to commence court proceedings against 13th Pty Ltd (and, depending on severity, prosecution of those connected to the company, potentially even prosecutions *in absentia*).\n* If igot owe you more than $2000, you can issue a letter of 'statutory demand' under section 459E of the Corporations Act 2001, which requires them to pay you within 21 days. If they don't pay up within that time, you can then apply to a court to have the company 'wound up' (essentially, the company is presumed insolvent and placed into voluntary administration, and is often eventually liquidated). This also applies if you go the small claims route and get a judgement in your favour (for an amount of $2000), but its probably more in your personal interests to just get your money back by repossessing and selling their stuff.\n \nOnce last thing /u/dan_igot. Given the company we've all been transacting with is (a) an Australian registered company with (b) all 100 shares held by 4 individuals, 3 living in Australia (75% Australian share ownership), how does your business model work exactly? \n\nI assume 13th Pty Ltd is effectively controlled by some offshore company. How do you transfer profits from this Australian subsidiary, owned entirely by individuals, to a foreign head company with no actual share ownership (and therefore no access to dividend distribution)? At least, barring some kind of transfer-pricing scheme? I also note that 13 Pty Ltd is registered for GST, yet does not apply GST to their transactions. Might want to take note of stuff like [this](https://www.ato.gov.au/Media-centre/Media-releases/Hundreds-of-tax-cheats-convicted/).\n\nAnyhoo, gotta run, have money to recover.

This gives the one day measure of stability. (Naturally need at least 24 observations to do this. Will be infinitely high when Bitstamp was down for a few days and there was perfect stability, so watch out.)\n\n* Column E - One divided by the standard deviation of the prior 48 values in Column C. This gives the two day measure of stability. Etc....\n\nThis is all you need to create my second and third charts. Note that you end up with a measure of stability for every individual hour.\n\nTo create my first chart with the weighted average you need stability for 7 to 31 days. It's just a weighted average based on the square of the number of days, so longer term stability contributes proportionally more.\n\nAnd that's it! If anything's unclear just let me know and I'll explain further.\n\nI think it'd be great to have the average chart as well as X day measures since they add a lot of detail.\n\nLastly, /u/Sluisifer is working on the rainbow charts.

The optimal place was $800 to $1000, months earlier. These are generally areas where many traders are still bullish because of the trend, and you get a lot of public buying. Hence the reason that these bullish posts exist and are regularly dug up for a "toldya so" moment. \n\nBut what do you get from this phase of the market, after it has topped out when everyone\'s bullish? More bear market. It will not turn up because the point of distribution is to sell into future weak hands at huge profits so the market will be flooded with supply. The demand from the public will eventually run out and cannot support this new supply, and these weak hands will eventually let go in the subsequent bear market. \n\nThe lesson here is one of market timing. Today there is an overabundance of bearishness and many traders are following the downtrend. The psychology is nearly polar opposite to the uber-bullishness seen last winter and summer because we are near a market bottom, probably an accumulation zone. This means the guys who sold during the best distribution areas are wanting to have another go at it and are quietly supporting the price. Meanwhile everyone else gets busy with the fear.\n\nThese sentiment posts help to demonstrate how trading affects our emotions, and how playing the game correctly goes against this.

If you agree that Bitcoin itself is not a zero-sum game, then who are the people who capture the positive value that it provides the world? \n\nThe only viable answer is **those who trade or own it**. Obviously those who trade it successfully are going to capture most of that value, and those who trade it poorly will of course fail to capture any of the surplus value at all.\n\nBasically, if wealth is being created in the macroscopic sense, it necessarily must wind up in the possession of microeconomic agents who are poised to capture or receive it (traders on individual exchanges).

I only deal with spot prices without leverage.": 2, 'Actually, trading is **not** necessarily a zero-sum game. In fact, it almost never is.\n\n\nYou can Google "gains from trade" for an easy-to-understand concept which demonstrates how trade enables gains/returns for *all* participants that would be entirely unavailable to nontrading entities.\n\n\nThe assumption that trading is a zero-sum game is not only wrong, but very pernicious because it makes intuitive sense if you don\'t think it through thoroughly.': 2, 'Gains from trade are, basically, the additional output that becomes available when separate parties are able to specialize (and focus on what they are good at) and exchange the produced goods to one another. If they were not able to spend their time/capital/focus on making the stuff that they\'re good at making, then everyone would be worse off because they\'d have to waste their expertise to spend time making stuff they\'re not good at making.\n\n\nI hope that makes sense so far, and helps to demonstrate how the activity of exchange can provide benefits that would otherwise not be available (i.e. provide net benefits to the system as a whole and thereby enable a positive-sum game).\n\n\nI\'m guessing that you understood that part, and the question you\'re asking has more to do with how Bitcoin could possibly factor in to all of this, because there is no asset being produced.\n\n\nThe thing is, producing a tangible asset is **not** the only form of productivity or economic gain that can take place. In fact, most first-world jobs (which certainly do provide benefits to the world) have *nothing* to do with the production of physical goods. Lawyers, writers, hairdressers, bankers, consultants, tech-support technicians, artists, performers, athletes, forex traders, plumbers... none of these professions produce any physical assets or goods, but they do provide the world with benefits and a definite form of economic output (some obviously more than others, but that\'s beside the point).\n\n\nMoney transmission is one of these industries in which the economic benefits are intangible. But just because no physical goods are being produced does not mean that there are no benefits being reaped by the efficient functioning of this industry. People do need to transmit funds to one another in society, and this is a valuable service, and the more efficiently it is executed the more benefits society is able to capture from it. \n\n\nOne might try to argue that Bitcoin doesn\'t yield any benefits and does not make money transmission any more efficient in any respect... but to be honest, it\'s pretty obvious that this is not true, and I don\'t want to waste any time here singing the praises of Bitcoin, which I\'m sure you have heard before anyway.\n\n\nSo far, this has all been *a priori* logic to demonstrate how Bitcoin can provide benefits to society through an intangible service (money transmission and value storage) and that these benefits could conceivably be captured by traders who buy and sell coins on the market. Hopefully you have agreed that such a thing is possible, but if not, let me know. If you\'d like a more concrete thought-experiment to illustrate how one might withdraw more money from an exchange than one deposited, but without another party losing an equivalent sum of money, then I can hopefully provide that, as well.\n\n\nPretend that after the block reward tapers off, every single person on earth simultaneously agrees to switch to Bitcoin as their monetary unit of account, and we make the transition (keep in mind that this is a thought experiment; it doesn\'t have to be realistic, just possible... to demonstrate a particular point). Bitcoins wind up worth $1 million apiece. Cool.\n\nNow, everyone is transacting in Bitcoin and pricing things in Bitcoin and being paid in Bitcoin. Meanwhile, the world economy continues doing what it does, and goods and services continue being produced and executed.\n\n\nAs more goods become available, the cost per good (as denominated in Bitcoin) falls. In other words, the growing supply of goods is not counterbalanced by a growing supply of money (coins), so the same amount of coins can now buy more stuff. Someone who initially bought $1000 worth of Bitcoin could later "withdraw" (or "spend") $2000 worth of goods and services later, thanks to deflation. Since everyone is holding their money as bitcoins, *everyone* is enjoying these deflationary benefits... in other words, **that extra money isn\'t coming out of anyone\'s pockets**. Instead, it is the result of a productive economy using sound money.\n\n\nSo hopefully you can see that trading Bitcoin does not have to be a zero-sum game. It still *could* be, but it is not *necessarily* so.': 1, "Yes people don't seem to understand this.": 2, "tl;dr: Since there's an asymmetric upside, a large disruption potential, and a virtuous cycle of adoption and value, I think in the long term accumulation is the only thing that matters.

Granted this only happens on like 3 month timescales. I'm not trading, I'm accumulating.\n\nBitcoin is the first programmable asset, that has been programmed to be a sound money in that it's scarce and fungible. The other man made currencies of our day have not been created to be sound, but rather to be malleable. Because of Bitcoin's difference in this attribute, it is unlike any other asset that exists. When I buy some of it, I make it more scarce, indefinitely, until I spend it. It is theoretically the best value holding instrument. I figure it's worth a gamble to see if it will pan out as indeed the best. \n\nWe've seen a superior tool dethrone a long standing tool many times before, it happens naturally because it is a superior tool. Telephone, cars, radio, the internet, email, etc, have all surpassed their predecessors, and surprised a lot of experts of the time.\n\nIn Bitcoin's case the function is value storage. What's peculiar about this function is that a scarce tool gets better at storing value with the more value that is stored in it.

Market conditions change quickly and you just don't have enough datapoints to build a good model that will work when trading live.\n\nWe have different algorithms trading on different timescales.

Bitcoiners need to realise that large financial institutions do not care about regulations. If it was profitable to trade and accept Bitcoin, they would already be doing it.\n\nMonetary historians will remember how and why the Eurodollar market originated in London. Since FDR\xe2\x80\x99s ascension to power in the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s, America has been a centrally planned and controlled economy. The free market exists in very few arenas. Banking swung from a free for all, to a collection of heavily regulated legacy banks. There were interest rate ceilings and severe restrictions on the issuance of commercial paper and foreign exchange trading. American banks (who loved the regulations so much) decided to issue dollar denominated debt without restrictions from London. The Eurodollar market arose in the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s to escape onerous US regulations. Morgan Stanley was one of the most active players in the new space.\n\nFrom Investopedia:\n\n>U.S.-dollar denominated deposits at foreign banks or foreign branches of American banks. By locating outside of the United States, eurodollars escape regulation by the Federal Reserve Board.\n\nEveryone else followed and the global liquidity centre for FX and derivatives became London. To this day London regulations on derivatives of all sorts are much lighter than American ones. Remember the \xe2\x80\x9cLondon Whale\xe2\x80\x9d? He was the trader responsible for JPM $6 billion dollar loss on exotic credit derivatives a few years back. His whole team sat out of London, far away from the prying eyes of the coterie of ineffective paid-off American regulators. Most large financial institutions book and house derivatives on London banking chains.\n\nThe Bitcoin community needs to wake up.

My reasoning for such was that the price had been stalling out around 300 while the longs on Finex were mounting. My stance on this only became stronger as the price fell and the longs stayed the same or rose higher from mid March to April. Given that the price was decreasing while more and more people seemed to be going long made me think that those longs were in deep shit (which at the time they probably were), and that in order to move up we'd need to lose all that dead weight (just like the earlier drop to 166 caused by mass forced liquidations).\n\nI've recently changed my mind about seeing new lows. I think it's very unlikely that we'll drop below 200 again for a few reasons. First of all, from mid April to present, the price has been in an upward channel but the swaps have been behaving identically to the period in which the price was dropping. To be more clear, I've been checking the sentiment tab on bfxdata every day for about three months and on a typical day I'll see between 2-3 million usd opened in longs in a 24h period. At the same time, the total longs open for most of that time has stayed relatively the same. This leads me to believe that all the longs that were in deep shit around April have been fully recycled at these lower 200 prices (i.e. they've changed hands). This essentially means that the price will need to go much lower to see any forced liquidations.\n\nMy second reason is that the price action itself has been behaving quite differently. In the period preceding the previous drop to 166, the price was distinctly going downward for two full months. In April this condition had almost been met, but after the price action in May it's looking very different.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back for me was seeing how some of the older altcoins have behaved for the past few weeks. You don't have to see value in altcoins to recognize that all of them going up could indicate a shift in sentiment for crypto at this moment.\n\nI think the glue that holds all these factors together would have to be the bullish sentiment I'm seeing lately. Individual news items really don't mean shit since their effects tend to be dispersed over a long time (not some surge in buying/selling 5 minutes after news hits). But a deluge of good news over time can absolutely have a significant effect on the trend and that's what I've been seeing lately.\n\nSo those are just some of my thoughts recently.

Consider this "calling it". \n\nNobody knows where miners really break even. The assumption is that miners are selling ALL their bitcoins today and so when the halving occurs there is so much demand and a 50% reduced supply therefore the price must jump 2x, right? Wrong. \n\nThe halving is a known occurrence. The date is approximate but everybody knows it\'s coming, it\'s already priced in to the coins. When the block reward is diminished miners may end up selling more of their stash, or shut down due to lack of profitability, but the one thing that\'s for sure is that people aren\'t going to pay simply to maintain the "status quo". Bitcoins exist as a transaction mechanism, not solely a device to enrich miners. The usability of a bitcoin isn\'t going to suddenly change because miners are being compensated less and I don\'t understand why anybody would think people should double the price of bitcoins just to maintain their current profitability. \n\nWhat really intrigues me is what the next goalpost will be - "Wall St. interest" hasn\'t raised the price, notable retailers "accepting" BTC hasn\'t raised the price, and so now all eyes are on the halving. This is the next milestone everybody here is counting on and what that inevitably fails to double the price as many anticipated there\'s going to be a lot of reflecting on economic fundamentals and people trying to reconcile their beliefs with the fact that there\'s hardly an Average Joe out there that gives a shit about the "scarcity" of digital non-proprietary coins. \n\nIf an Average Consumer doesn\'t need or want to use Bitcoins the day before the halving, why would they suddenly desire them the next day? That\'s not logical. What is logical is miners shutting down because the music has stopped for them. All the "strong hands" buying coins now will be the ones left to prop up the price, and it\'s pretty clear these "strong hands" unfortunately aren\'t capable of actually raising the price. New money is desperately needed, however there\'s no real new incentives for this new money to arrive. \n\nNobody here will suddenly be willing to pay double the next day. Face it, everybody is counting on this "halving" news making it into mainstream media and somehow convincing average people to buy a piece before it\'s too late.

What you are describing is pseudo-science or religion, not proper science.\n\nIn proper science like physics it is not like what you say. Instead, there is a first step before the hypothesis, namely the step of observation and possibly simple experiment:\n\n* First you make observations of nature or first experiments about certain phenomena,\n\n* second you create a model/theory/hypothesis/formula/mathematical description of the behaviour.\n\n* Third you make further experiments/observations and let others do the same, to confirm or disprove the theory.\n\nNo serious scientist makes the second step without the first (except pseudo-scientists, see below).\n\nExamples:\n\n(a) Kepler FIRST OBSERVED the planets, and only AFTERWARDS made a mathematical model of how planets move. As a third step it was found by further observation that these laws also apply to objects that Kepler has not yet looked at.\n\n(b) Newton first has observed how items move or accelerate in dependence of mass or force (famous story of an apple falling on his head) and made simple experiments like letting objects fall from different heights. Then he created a mathematical model to get a formal description. In a third step, he and others made many more experiments to confirm the validity of the formulas for various types of test setups.\n\n(c) Einstein first observed certain things in the world did not fit together with current physical theory, and only then created his theory of relativity based on these observation. Again, as a third step, dedicated experiments in various fancy setups, and further astronomical observations, confirmed his theory.\n\n(d) Social science first collects data and makes statistics about certain things. Only afterwards, some rules and findings are derived from that data. As a last step, cross-checks are made by independent studies from other parts of the world.\n\nI cannot think of a single field in science where a hypothesis is proposed as a first step, without any observations or simple experiments having been taken place beforehand, except pseudo-science. Example of pseudo-science:\n\n* There are theories in the esoteric "free-energy" community that a machine can be built that creates energy out of nothing. This theory is not based on any observation or experiment, but only based on pure wishful thinking (they just misuse school physics to support their theories by mis-interpreting school physics for their purposes, liek using established terms in complete new context). So they do the second step without the first. (Not) amazingly, they fail in step three, i.e. the confirmation of the theory by concrete experiment has failed ever since, since decades, but they stick to their "hypothesis" anyway, always finding "good" [irony!] excuses. So this is certainly not what I would call "science", it is much closer to "religion".\n\n* Homeopathy: In full absence of any upfront observation or experiment, Mr. Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann invented the concept of homeopathy. It sounded somewhat plausible to him, so he built-up that system. Afterwards, any truly scientific(!) method for finding empirical evidence failed to prove that homeopathie really works, and also no scientific theory can explain why it should work. Nevertheless, people still believe in it and find unscientific excuses why the "step 2" failed to prove it, and coem up with their own (unscientific!) "evidences" that allegedly have shown that it works. In fact, science has proven by multiple evidence that homeopathie does work, but not more than the placebo effect (which HAS indeed an effect, also on children or animals!), but that homeophatie has no effect that goes beyond that of a placebo.\n\nTL;DR:\n\nReligion = Step 1: Make hypothesis/theory; Step 2: Believe it, because you cannot prove it.\n\nScientific method: Step 1: Observation/Experiment; Step 2: Make hypothesis/theory; Step 3: Make further observation/experiment to confirm (or disprove) the hypothesis.\n\nPseudo science: Step 1: Make hypothesis/theory based on nothing; Step 2a: Try to confirm by concrete experiment and fail, but use lots of excuses why it failed; Step 2b: Believe it anyway. --> very close to religion.': 1, 'What effort?

So whenever there SEEMS to be a trend, it is allegedly just a coincidence and has no meaning for the future (because to have a meaning for the future, human psychology would have to be part of the equation, which cannot be the case by definition, because markets are "perfect" by law of dogma and just don\'t follow trendlines by law of ~~nature~~ dogma).\n\nI prefer to belong to the third, pragamtic, group of people. I don\'t view charts or TA as religion. Neither am I a blind believer of trends around every corner, nor am I a fierce denier of trends altogether. Instead, I simply open my eyes and use common sense, and trying hard avoiding my common sense to get fooled by wrong signs.\n\nNow, looking back at the [chart whose image is linked in the OP](http://i.imgur.com/1vOUpms.png) (please click it again to refresh your mind), we see that it does not just show an arbitrary trend line. Instead I plotted a line that shows a trend of the last ca. 1 1/2 years and had acted as a resistence MULTIPLE times, relatively regularly and very reliably, during that time period. It cannot be replaced easily by a new trendline, should this trend get broken. It took time until the trend really established itself as a trend:\n\nIt took exactly 1/2 year between the all time high and the first support point around **1-10 June 2014 at ca. 670 USD**. At this point in time, it was not yet a trend. Next, the chart touches the same line again between ca. **20 Aug - 20 Sep 2014 at ca. 500 USD** and sticks to it for this 1 month-period, see 2nd and 3rd arrow in the image of the OP. Even at that time, I would have been cautious calling it a trend already. But then, see the 4th arrow in the image, the chart found again resistance from this very same trend line around **15 Nov - 15 Dec 2014 (ca. 370 USD)**, before it went down again. At this moment it was no more possible to deny the fact that there is apparently a market force (driven by human psychology or whatever) that made the chart find substantial resistance at this trend line. This same trend line confirmed itself as a strong resistance 2 times afterwards, when it did not let the chart pass beyond that line: Around **12 - 21 Mar 2015 (ca. 280 USD)** (5th arrow!), and around **9 - 22 May 2015 (ca. 235 USD)** (6th arrow!).\n\nSo, with all this, it is really obvious to see that this trend line constitutes a strong resistance of the chart. This implies two things:\n\n- First, this trend line obviously plays a big role by market participants, who "obey" this trend line (i.e. take profit when chart approaches the line from the bottom, and buy back when it is too far below), and it is more likely that the chart keeps on staying below that trendline for some more time to come, as it used to do the last 1/2 year.\n\n- Secondly, if the chart manages to break the trendline substantially (more than the slight break of ~6 weeks duration that we saw around 1 Jul - 15 Aug 2014 [between 1st and 2nd arrow]), it my indicate that the complete downtrend is over and a new (long) bull market is about to come.\n\nSo, having said that, I think that trendlines, if used and looked at in a reasonable way, and when avoiding seeing trendlines around each and every corner, they *are* useful indeed. But I am aware that different people think differently, and even after reading this post, many people will remain in their first or second group of people, the "blind believers" and the "fierce deniers" - well, I can live with that, that\'s what makes markets so irrational after all :-) - trends only work because a substantial part of market participants don\'t believe in them!': 1, 'that picture is not from me, you have to ask the originator of this picture': 3, "Yes, it's a link....": 3, 'Seems Geece broke the downtrend against my prediction, but now we seem to head straight back to the downtrend line - expecting 100-150 USD soon.': 1, "> Such people do not exist in this subreddit.\n\nexcept the 52% of visitors that have upvoted this thread. But thanks for raising the voice in place of everybody else - that's true democracy.": 1, 'A "trend\' is a post-hoc description for price action.  Sometimes the price persists in moving in a direction for fundamental reasons.  E.g. the equity of Amazon is ownership is a company with great management and a great business model; as the company keeps performing unusually well, the stock keeps rising.  Or, the Yen keeps declining because the Japanese central bank keeps printing massive amounts of Yen etc.\n  Sometimes a price continues moving in one direction because of an order flow imbalance that is not immediately priced in because it is not understood or is there not enough money to do so.  For example, if some bitcoin early adopters were quietly liquidating their holdings without anyone knowing, they would continue putting downward pressure on price over time.  \n  And sometimes, the price continues moving in a direction because of psychology - people see the trend and hop on.  In this last case, it\'s usually a good bet to take the other side.  Because of it\'s primarily the trend followers driving the trend, then that means the price has deviated from "fair."  If the price is falling, then it means speculators have become short.  They eventually want to buy and profit.  The depressed price will eventually attract fundamental buyers who will break the trend and then the speculators will all rush to cover, often creating a volatile price spike.\n\nFiguring out which scenario you\'re in is sometimes difficult, sometimes easy.  It\'s usually easy to spot big margin calls and extreme speculator sentiment.  \n\nMy key point on these kinds of charts and discussions is not that there\'s zero validity to analyzing a trend, but that the people doing so are almost always practicing cargo-cult science.  They are looking at chart patterns and not the underlying dynamics driving those patterns, similar to the way indigenous tribes would create airports out of bamboo and expect planes to land.': 1, 'That looks a lot like [mine](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/36exql/we_are_in_a_stable_downtrend_200_usd_by_mid_of/crdv2pt)': -1, 'This picture you are linking is not from me, it looks like nonsense.\n\nthe downtrend line that I outlined in the OP in log scale is definitely everything but arbitrary, see the arrows I drew into it.\n\nIt is very obvious that this is the result of human market psychology and not of a random walk.': 0, 'That picture is mine.

Observation and "simple experiment" are fine as a first step.  The problem is when scientists (and pseudo-scientists) do things like run 20 different experiments and then claim that 1 is statistically significant at the 5% level.  Modern science is actually struggling with this exact issue.  Lots and lots of major studies published over the last 50 years in reputable journals are turning out to be false.  Not because of any dishonesty by the researchers, but simply because of the nature of statistics.  If I run 100 experiments, random chance suggests that 5 will turn out to be significant at the 5% level.  If I test 100 drugs on cancer, I\'ll get 5 false positives at the 5% level etc...\n\nThere\'s two ways to avoid this problem.  1. Don\'t do the extensive experimentation and data collection until you have a hypothesis to minimize the number of experiments you\'re doing.  Or 2. Test and replicate the successful experiments multiple times to reduce likelihood of false positives.  #2 can be very difficult in situations where the experiment is very time consuming and costly, like in clinical drug trials or long-term population studies.  ': 1, 'I agree with your general categorization, however the trend line in question was violated numerous times, and once for a long period by a substantial amount.  It was not reliable at all.  If you want to ignore these early violations, then you\'re counting on just 3 data points, 3 times where the market rallied up to the line and then fell, over a period that includes more than 70 data points.  And even then 2 of the 3 violated the line in different ways.  \n\nSome elements of behavioral finance are clearly translated into charts.  For example, constant levels of support and resistance are real and result from anchoring bias.  Certain patterns of consolidation followed by volatile movement followed by consolidation also follow directly from behavioral psychology.  While a general trend can certainly have a fundamental or momentum chasing psychological basis, the idea of the specific value of the line at a point in time being meaningful doesn\'t fit.  The only source of a "magic" bounce off a trendline is that a few traders made it bounce.  If enough traders do something, it happens.  If enough traders think that $100 is an important price, then it will be.

The OP says there is a profound **likelihood** that we will see 200 USD by July BECAUSE OF the trend and because the chart is likely to follow the trend for yet some time to come. This trend mechanics, *combined* with fundamentals (pre-MtGox-bubble prices where in 100 USD region) makes this likelihood even higher.\n\nThere is no certainty (there never possibly can), but the likelihood that we see 200 USD by July is higher than what it would be if that trend line didn\'t exist. For example, if the price had hoovered around 220..280 USD throughout the time from January 2014 till today, without any visible downtrend within this narrower range, then there would be no justification for claiming that it is likely that prices will approach 200 USD by July.\n\nInterestingly, trends only work because some people dogmatically reject that trends have any relevance. So they ignore trends in their trading decisions, which is why prices touch an established trend line in the first place. Only then the "trend-not-ignorers" make their trading decisions, which avoids the prices to substantially surpass the trend line sustainably. If all traders fully believed in the trend as the sole factor of influence, everybody would react well before the price touched the trendline (so they don\'t come too late), and as a result the trend would be ended.

Being an ETN, the price will stay perfectly in line with spot price (they use an average of OKC, BFX, BTSP), unlike the utterly ridiculous swings we've seen with GBTC.

It used to be the case that an altcoin could have bubbles very easily, but that isn\'t true anymore.  In 2013, multipools were a new thing - even the most advanced ones were suboptimal, and they paid out only in bitcoins, and were difficult to use.\n\nToday\'s altcoin scene is vastly different.  A coin\'s value is almost solely determined on its merits.  Multipools today trade across 10 exchanges and find the best price, trade through multiple currency pairs if necessary, mine 200 coins, mine multiple coins at once, merge mine 8 or 10 coins at once, compute and optimize for work restart times, optimize whether it is even a good idea to do work restarts when a merge mining block comes in, switch at 20ms intervals rather than using services like Coinwarz, pay out in any coin, pay US dollars, and more.  The pools are aware of exactly how much hashpower it takes to mine a certain number of blocks in a certain amount of time, and how deep the market is before the coin becomes unprofitable.  The technology is light years ahead of what it was in 2013.\n\nAs a result, as soon as a bubble appears in any coin, it is quickly aborted because pools switch to it in milliseconds, sell exactly the number of blocks needed to fill the unreasonably priced buy orders, and turn around and buy the coins that people want.\n\nThe key thing to know if you are investing in altcoins is that all coins for a particular algorithm will have a bubble at once.

For 25 CAD for an Interac deposit they were out of their minds. I think the founders did work in lobbying the Canadian senate, so they had some sort of first-mover excuse for their fees. But that's passed now.": 2, 'Perhaps it would be helpful to point to some ways you guys are actually going about this? ': 2, "This is the reddit crust of pesimissm. Good that coinsetter purchased this company before the founders decided to abandon it. I hope that CaVirtex's UI gets improved. This was discussed under the old management but never actually got done. QCX has a better interface IMO.": 2, 'Address reuse us a pretty big no no.': 2, "the shill accounts here don't even try anymore": 10, 'Seems like the address reuse requirement and this are among the reasons for CAVirtex having fewer buyers than QuadrigaCX:\n\nCAVIRTEX: "To prevent fraud in general we have implemented a 14 calendar day hold before allowing any withdrawals from any methods after depositing CAD with us for the first time. During this hold time, users will be able to trade with deposited funds but not withdraw these funds."': 2, 'in my shill management 101 course this is the first thing that is taught -- other than ABS(always be shilling) a proper shill management system means complete accountability of all socket puppets and shill accounts before rendering a post into the public domain like reddit ': 3, 'lmao did you forget what account you were logged in under? nice job shill account. Proof for when he deletes this comment: http://i.imgur.com/hp60NPs.png': 4, 'This is a security measure we are taking, and we are also requiring users to designate a single withdrawal address in the process. We have a similar requirement on Coinsetter to make sure that, even if your account is compromised, funds can never truly be stolen. I agree that it is not the most user-friendly process, but Cavirtex users should sleep well at night because of it.': 1, "While the CAD market certainly does have less liquidity than most USD markets, Cavirtex is nevertheless the best source of bitcoin liquidity in Canada. It's a focus of ours to continue attracting liquidity to Cavirtex's order book.": -1, "That's what 2 factor and email withdraw verification is for. ": 3, "Cavirtex was recently acquired by coinsetter so it's possible they get liquidity from them (arbitrage, etc).\n\nI recently deposited via ETF as well (took 8.5 days)  to purchase BTC and noticed their BTC withdrawals are still disabled. This could be the reason for the lower price. I did a support email to get the withdrawals enabled on my account and managed to withdraw successfully. Its a little worrisome that they're still disabled on accounts by default though.": 8, "So you're saying if I sell Bitcoin on cavirtex I get less money for my Bitcoin then on cavirtex. I don't see why this is a good thing.\n\nAlso did cavirtex just get caught shilling. Scumbags!": 3, "take a look at the btc-e order book sometime man, I think it'll open up your eyes to just how much order flow actually cares about 'deep liquidity'": 2, ';)': -4, 'That would not cause a sustained price differential.': 1, 'Virtex is the worst + expensive at every feature or move. Quadriga is better in every way (only 2 fees: interact cash in + commission)': 2, 'I totally understand your point, but there are pros and cons to both. There are other exchanges in the market if using a different address for every transaction is a priority for you, but this setup makes us feel very good about user security.': 1, 'Not sure why all the downvotes -- good to see the growth happening -- slowly but surely': -1, "tight spreads are only a function of liquidity if there's volume at the spread. Otherwise, a tight spread is pretty much useless. \n\nalso, having the ability to trade in your native currency trading pair removes a lot of the costs associated with using a different currency trading pair (FX conversion, international wire transfer, etc.), which at least help to subsidize your native currency pair's liquidity cost\n\nIt really irritates me when someone is blindly negative about things they think they know more about then they actually do. either do something to help address the liquidity issue (which the CAV & CSX guys actually are) or go back to trolling /r/buttcoin. \n\nRome wasn't built in a day my friend... emerging markets take years to develop deep liquidity and general reliability. Why would this be any different? \n\n": 1, "Nice to hear you bring this up! You're correct this is related to new market makers on the exchange.": -2}}}
