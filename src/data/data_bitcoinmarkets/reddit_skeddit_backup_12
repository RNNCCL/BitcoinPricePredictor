As for keeping in cold storage, some people would rather turn insane profits than that (although the past few weeks holding has probably been the best strategy).': 1, 'The original post asked which exchanges are best.  I responded with an honest assessment of our experiences with each of the exchanges.  Everything I said is true, and favoring one exchange over another doesn\'t make anyone a "shill."\n\nAll of the exchanges have their own problems.  I don\'t think a single one is registered as a money services business.  I personally don\'t see why anyone would run an exchange, as none of these exchanges can possibly be profitable given all the laws and paperwork - the volume needed to make profits on 0.0025 margins is far beyond the money that goes across the exchanges.': 3, "We trade with six exchanges: Cryptsy, Poloniex, Bittrex, Allcoin, Bleutrade, and CCex.\n\nOf these exchanges, Poloniex is best.  Their customer service is exceptional.  You can get in touch directly with the main developer if necessary.  CCex also has great service and they even lowered their API throttling delay for us when we asked.  Bittrex is most useful for trading new altcoins, because they are aggressive at adding and deleting coins.  If you want to take the risks, you can trade LTC for new coins at Bittrex the day they open.\n\nUnfortunately, Allcoin, Bleutrade, and Ccex often have thin markets.  Selling even a single block of litecoins at one of these exchanges can decimate the price.  Despite all our positive experiences at the other exchanges, our volume counter in the upper left bar of Cryptsy still ticks up to 40BTC nowadays.  Cryptsy always has the best prices, and it's the only place where we can dump entire blocks and not run through lots of buy orders.\n\nThis is a situation where there isn't really much choice.  Cryptsy is awful at responding to customer service queries and they charge 0.001BTC of withdrawal fees regardless of amount, and yet none of the other exchanges has enough depth to trade in large volumes.\n\nMake your choice based on volume.  If you only want to throw around a few litecoins here and there, then choose Poloniex.  The withdrawal fees are low there, and you can benefit from all the other features they offer despite their thinner markets.  If, like us, you rack up large volume, then you'll lose too much money to slippage if you trade anywhere other than Cryptsy.\n\nFinally, you can't arbitrage the markets.  For low-volume traders, the exchanges make more money in withdrawal fees than they do in trade fees.  And the exchanges take hours to process withdrawals.  Choose one exchange and stick with it.": -9, 'Probably because 1) I was a joke(you know adding humor) and 2) because Polo is a terrible exchange to trade LTC especially considering if you want to move more the $2k you get to give them all your KYC/AML details -- not to mention they are running an illegal swap facility IN the US -- the CFTC does not look kindly upon such activity and I expect the hammer to come fairly soon.

Essentially, is this just another way of describing a reliable 3rd party audit, with the addition of 3rd party cold storage?\n\n4. 0.75% seems quite high, but i understand that Elliptic's gotta make a buck. Since this is on account value, are you concerned (or excited, for whatever your incentive structure is) that this will push ringed-fence service users into trades with higher margin to reduce cost exposure?\n\nSorry for the meandering thoughts. Thanks for posting": 2, "Hey, thanks for the Qs:\n\n1. We chose Elliptic because they have full insurance for the USD value of the bitcoin assets they hold, by a Fortune 100 insurer. We think it is the safest way to store bitcoins that is available.\n\n2. It reduces risk because it is Elliptics core business to safely store bitcoins whereas we are a market place. There are also conflicts of interests if the market place holds the assets. Also, Elliptic provides above mentioned insurance so in case of operational issues, our clients will still be covered.\n\n3. You can be your own auditor with our solution because you can track your account on the blockchain on a continuous basis, it is updated every business day. So in addition to your bitcoins being insured, you can verify yourself that they are there, every day. Since every one of our client can do that, it also means that the solvency of our company as a whole can continuously be audited on the blockchain.\n\n4. We do not think that 0.75% annually is very high, given the investment in infrastructure and processes that are required to obtain insurance form a major insurer. You do not have to go for the insured/ring fenced solution though, you can elect to keep your bitcoins in Crypto Facilities' cold storage at zero cost.": 2, 'Awesome.

They offer some technical backround here: https://github.com/Coinffeine/coinffeine/wiki/Exchange-algorithm\n\n1. This will not be ideal for serious day trading, more of an alternative to LBTC. Execution time is on resolution of block confirmation times for the micropayment channel, so we\'re talking far beyond even the latency issues of a decentralized network.\n2. I\'m in the US so there\'s pretty much nothing useful I can do on the platform except take a peek at the order book. OKPay is not available to US customers. I\'m a bit skeptical about prospect of Paypal or similar in the states, as the API calls for trickle transactions seem like they would be extremely easy to flag and shutdown. This risk is acknowledged in the coinffeine wiki.  That and Paypal and the like are completely reversible.\n3. Maybe I lack imagination, but I can\'t see how you could securely have leveraged trading. One way or another, you have to borrow either fiat or btc to make that happen. That\'s pretty much a dead end with fiat. With BTC, you\'d have to involve some mutually trusted service and oracle to settle trades. Existing btc scripting alone isn\'t enough to support this level of smart contracts. It can be less trust required in so far as that the service can\'t run off w/ your coins Goxstyle, but there seems open possibility of collusion with one party (similar to escrow), and possible vulnerabilities on the oracle platform. Reggie Middleton\'s ultracoin thing (veritaseum) comes to mind. His pitch sells it as no middleman and no counterparty risk, but the process requires a facilitator to settle trades with multisig, as well as an oracle service for pricing data. \n': 5, 'all good, i got mine': 6, '[He missed a star.](http://i.imgur.com/wbfFcJH.png)': 4, 'Related question, in case anybody knows: How would stop loss fees work?  \nI would guess a "stop loss" is a "taker" but a "stop loss limit" is a "maker" order.

When doing multiple simultaneous trades like this, you can\'t be sure that all trades will complete, so it\'s safer to buy in small amounts, quickly[1].

The point of this mechanism is supposedly to stimulate economy by forcing people to spend.\n\nIf the Greek government switched to Bitcoin it would indeed have the same problem as with euro, in a sense that it couldn't print more of it.\n\nBut while the article is correct, it's missing the point. Of course Bitcoin is bad centralized fiat currency! In the same way, car is also very bad horse. Car doesn't work very well without roads while any horse is able to jump over the fallen log.\n\nSo no, Bitcoin would not solve the problems of Greek government.

However those Greeks that have money have probably moved it out of the country long ago.\n\nYou've got the point regarding Bitcoin adoption, however, it's not standing still. It's just that the world is a big place and you don't hear that much about it. But look at [all Bitcoin ATMs](http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-atm-map/), see all [Bitcoin accepting businesses](http://bitcoinmaps.info/) that are popping up, or [number of blockchain.info wallets](https://blockchain.info/charts/my-wallet-n-users?timespan=all&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=) and you won't be able to say that adoption is slowing.\n\nHell, just look at notable businesses that started accepting Bitcoin.

As a conclusion, it is safe to say that reddit is *extremely* bullish for the remainder of the year. Only 6 people expect the price to stay under $300 for the remainder of 2015. Out of 288 valid guesses, \n\n* 242 predict a high of $400 or more\n* 143 predict a high of $700 or more\n* 86 predict a high of $1000 or more\n* 40 predict a high of $2500 or more\n* 15 predict a high of $5000 or more\n\nBest of luck to all of you, especially the guy who predicted $175k.

The idea is to fix the problem of a model that is based on absolute $ difference being biased torwards lower guesses, and a percentage based model being biased torwards moon shot guesses. It basically acts as a leverage, in that guesses closer than 5% to the actual value get a multiplier (they get multiplied with a value lower than 1, which in this case is good, since we are looking for the lowest result), and everything over 5% gets a progressively harder penalty. This is propably way more complicated than it has to be, but if I\'m not mistaken, it should work and it should be a fair and transparent way to find a winner come January 2016.\n\n-----\n\nThanks again to /u/imog and /u/YRuafraid for pledging to match my reward for 1st place, and to /u/azop for his prize of 0.1 BTC to the 2nd place!\n\n**Edit:** uploaded some better pictures': 33, "I'll have a play around with the data tonight and will see what I get.\n\nOut of interest: what's your guess?": 1, 'It is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3dwp4g/daily_discussion_monday_july_20_2015/ct9plta)\n\n> I worked out an average of the log of price and got $275 / $896 (or $809 if we removed $10k guesses).\n\n': 1, 'Someone could still use a really large number to swing the results.

Literally and without exaggeration this sub has turned every single moment of stability into some do or die situation.  Every single moment of stability for the last 18 months has been a "the next two weeks are critical moment".  If you turn every moment in bitcoin history into a critical moment, eventually one of those moments will break upward.  You have no idea if this pump will break $300 and continue or if it\'ll hit $300 and stall.  Despite all the claims about critical junctures and this and that, none of you have a clue.  We\'ve been at 50 other critical junctures this year already and here we are.  It\'s hilarious that you all feel so vindicated because 1 out of 100 of your predictions has some how validated the bottom is in and moon = imminent.\n\n> There is plenty of international demand and newcomers everyday abroad.\n\nSource?  All I see is a failing currency and a sparsely used payment network.  Bitpay processed $300 million in 2014 and $150 million of that was labeled dubiously as "mining" which I wouldn\'t even count as a measure of economic activity.  Of the $150 million of actual economic activity, ~$75 million was from gold bugs cashing out of bitcoin to buy gold (from a company that has since stole their users money and went out of business none the less).  And so we\'re left with the biggest bitcoin payment processor processing just $75 million of real retail transactions in 2014.  A number which is so laughably insignificant I can\'t believe the price didn\'t tank when those numbers were released.\n\nOther then that I see a network that processes roughly 30,000 transactions per day excluding chain transactions.  5,000 or so of which are for true retail sales through BitPay and Coinbase, the other 25,000 who knows.  Again, completely dismal outlook on a global payment system.\n\nI see hype around remittance usage and hype around capital control usage.  In neither scenario I see raw data to give us an idea of how many people actually use it for these purposes.  And if I don\'t see data, I am left to conclude the numbers, just like Bitpay\'s, are completely dismal.  Just more hype of bitcoin that isn\'t happening.  Bitcoiners LOVE to pump bitcoin and their products, so if there really was usage in either of those sectors, we\'d have seen numbers by now.\n\nSo what are we left with?  Cryptographic time stamping?  Is that what NASDAQ is currently going to use the block chain for?  That\'s probably the only thing I see in bitcoins future is utilizing the blockchain as a digital seal of authenticity.  Only problem is that requires no bitcoins.  One bitcoin can seal millions of documents, transactions, or what have you.  Time stamping will not create a demand for coins at all, and it will certainly not attract users to the network.  \n\n': -13, 'His twitter account is advertising it. Interesting move by his PR team.

It\xe2\x80\x99s usually the time when the smart money quietly accumulates supply without trying to move prices up too high.\n\nTransitioning from bear to bull requires a calm period where prices appear to be in limbo. We experienced this with bitcoin for a couple of months as prices hovered within a tight range between $228-$242.

This is the general area of support before the first dump below $300. Although $300 is a round number that has great psychological impact on traders, there\xe2\x80\x99s been too many fakeouts so we need to see a clean break past $316 for this new trend to be fully confirmed.\n\nAt the moment there\xe2\x80\x99s a nice cup and handle formation that appears on the charts.

If you log in from *any* new ip address, your account withdrawals effectively get frozen for 24hrs.
