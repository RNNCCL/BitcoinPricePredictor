{'10-15-2014': {('[Daily Discussion] Wednesday, October 15, 2014', 23): {"A Bankrate.com survey, [quoted in the Washington Post yesterday](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/get-there/wp/2014/10/14/the-reason-americans-are-spending-less/), shows some rather disturbing news for US retailers: people are spending less.\n\nWhy are they spending less? Stagnant income, attempting to save, and concerns about the economy. \n\nBut perhaps the underlying reason is even more fundamental than that: debt. The average American household [carries $15,000 in credit card debt](http://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-card-data/average-credit-card-debt-household/) at rates of around 15-20%. The average American student graduating from college [carries $30,000 in student loan debt](http://blogs.wsj.com/numbers/congatulations-to-class-of-2014-the-most-indebted-ever-1368/).\n\nThis indebtedness has been encouraged by a combination of dollar devaluation and low interest rates, which incentivize borrowing over saving.\n\nWithout growth in real wages it seems that US households will eventually run out of slack on the consumer spending [that makes up 70% of the US economy](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-10-14/the-11-trillion-advantage-that-shields-u-s-from-turmoil.html). \n\nThe next Federal Open Market Committee meeting is October 28th with rate adjustments announced on the 30th. Expect some scary announcements about QE4 or similar stimulus programs just in time for Halloween. The Fed has really painted itself into a corner with regard to their current policies -- expect the markets to rejoice once again -- but American consumers, and therefore the US economy, are running on fumes.\n\nThe reason I'm posting this (yet again) in a Bitcoin markets sub, is that I think the two are increasingly related, especially with Lawsky's comments about BTC exchanges in New York. There have to be a few parties who see the growth in digital currency as a long-term play to hedge their bets against the ever-growing fear of inflation.

Heh.': 1, 'No, and if you inquire about it here you will be downvoted to oblivion, I once asked the same question.': 1, 'I\'m tied up with things today, so just a quick reply to hopefully get you rolling:\n\nInitialization of EMAs (and other indicators whose inputs include previous values of that self-same indicator) is surely as open to interpretation as the rest of TA, but when I was digging into this last year during my self-induced backtest-mania I did spot some more common recommendations, all of which boil down to finding a starting value which does not reference the indicator\'s previous value.\n\nOne is to just start the EMA up from the previous raw value. This is the weakest by far, particularly when applied to high-volatility source data, though probably pretty commonly applied anyway and requires that you mentally discount earlier values earlier in the series since they are likely to be way off from a more rigorously-initialized EMA series.\n\nAnother is to use an n-period SMA to provide the starting value. This is efficient in both space and time but has the usual SMA downside of "barking" as outliers both enter and leave the sampled window. This would require, for your example, four years of candles _before_ the start of your chart, in order to produce the single SMA value needed to spark up the EMA. (And, if that chosen start day happened to make the SMA bark then the start of the EMA could be thrown off.)\n\nThe best without getting too esoteric is likely to use an n-period weighted moving average, where the weights are set to approximate the weighting that an EMA would produce for its input values. This is far more accurate than the other two approaches mentioned so far but is more expensive in terms of space and time. This too will still require four years of candles before the start of your chart. To cut that down...\n\nIf one were more mathematically inclined, they could determine a level of error they are comfortable with in the early EMA output and then produce an m-period WMA or SMA where m is less than n. This would allow for the EMA to get rolling earlier in source data that does not have enough values for either of the n-period moving average approaches mentioned above, though with the negative of having greater error, particularly in the earlier parts of the series.\n\nAll of these approaches, and the others that exist out there, will progressively converge towards the same EMA output values as their respective series progress. Given a long enough history of data, and/or a small enough value for n, this is the good news. But if you are trying to run a really long EMA over an instrument with a relatively short history then you\'re going to have a bad time. (Particularly when trying to read all but the most recent of its EMA output.)\n\nDon\'t forget, too, that once you\'ve initialized the EMA, the EMA formula itself also depends on whether you happen to prefer Wilder\'s variation or are using one of his indicators which builds upon an EMA (since his indicators that do so themselves assume that you will use his EMA variation to drive them.)\n\nAll of the above and far, far more is out there for the googling. As such, I\'ll leave you to it from here.': 2, "how strong is the correlation between coinbase and bitstamp?

It doesn\'t even focus on 52 candles, as such. Data never "drops off" an EMA, though some folks here have made the mistake of saying so. Any single EMA value includes data going back _forever_. This means that properly initializing it is a rather interesting topic unto itself. :) The 52 in this example doesn\'t even have any special meaning. It isn\'t "one-year-worth" of weekly data as such. It is just a number, a number which feeds into a formula (not even entirely agreed upon, as there are at least two popular variations of the formula and they affect the results) and controls the weight of the input value and the weight of the preceding EMA value which are then combined to produce the EMA value for the current input value. Lots of people assume "If I set it to 52 I get 52 weeks worth of data in my EMA." Wrong. The number is just a parameter used to produce a weight. It isn\'t even the weight itself, ala "If I put in 52 then the weight is 1/52."

Each device\'s interface would allow you to configure your payout address, and mine against that vendor\'s pool (at a cost probably) by default. So you have an aggregate of 12 TH/s, netting you 0.00045 BTC/day (or $4.50 USD). Those dump into your wallet as just another source of income, negating a little of the cost of vampire power, and establishing a nicely decentralized surface for global transaction processing.

Yes mining to them is much cheaper, but remember that the ramp-up costs are significantly higher as well, ASIC development can cost $2-$20 million USD per revision, and you have to have extremely bright folks well versed in VHDL/Verilog to perform chip design, who typically like to be paid well enough to drive Teslas and own spacious homes.\n\nTypically the approach by ASIC designers has been one of a few strategies:\n\n* Solicit investment funding for the NREs and then mine like crazy on an internal mine.\n\n* "presell hardware" and use that to cover ASIC design, then delay the pre-ordered hardware to be mined with, to recoup the costs of production (or better still, just keep it forever and leave your customers hanging!)\n\n* Do a combination of the above, where revenue is invested like a normal company would, into R&D and ASIC design, and pre-assembled miners are sold just at or after their ROI point.\n\nYes, mining is zero sum ultimately, and that is scary. I know that I and every miner within several percentage points above me are below that golden curve. The plan is to continue my process of reinvestment, not just increasing hashrate but increasing my hashrate against the global hashrate. Once the next halving occurs, the mining landscape is again going to shift, and we won\'t have ASICs to save the miners\' profits. And by that point, nearly all miners will be businesses (yes, people will continue to hobby mine, but they won\'t account for an appreciable share of the hashrate).\n\nMining centralization had to happen. My miners are within driving distance, but out of State, due to power costs. Given the razor thin margins, and the requirement to be on the leading edge of all miners to be one of the profitable ones, mining will be like water: always desperately seeking the point of lowest energy. As energy costs are not evenly distributed, you\'ll see smaller miners moving their gear to "group mines" where the cheapest locally available power is. As difficulty goes up, those local group mines will go dark because even as an aggregate they won\'t be able to remain profitable against non-local areas with access to even less expensive power.\n\nAs far as margins and risk and competition go, we haven\'t seen anything yet. Nothing. What do I see? This is what I see:\n\n* Energy exhaustion: eventually all mining will be centralized at the locations on earth with the least expensive power costs; geothermal, solar, nuclear, etc. This will drive out all profit-motivated small miners who are unable to reach that source of energy. Considering most miners (50.001%) are irrational due to the zero sum nature of mining, they will continue to mine until their upkeep costs (housing & power) equal their revenue, and those costs are today about 10% of mined coin, it will be a while, but they will continue to mine at a loss until they go dark.\n\n* Restriction of Production: Most people mining today, who decide to "stick with it", will see two more halvings in the course of their mining operation. Those who fail to plan for those events will be squeezed out of mining as they realize BTC losses (even if the exchange rate skyrockets and they see USD gains, it will still end up being a net loss), and are unable to continue operation. Those whose margins will allow a 50% reduction in production will have to be very proactive in managing their hardware investments between the 12.5 and 6.25 halvings (~2016-2021).\n\n* KNC, BFL, Hashfast, Black Arrow, these are not the product chain players to be worried about, their contribution will be very heavy over all because of their early start in mining, but will -pale- in comparison with the future. If Bitcoin gains serious traction, do you really expect these novelty toy companies to continue to dominate the industry? They can\'t even run their own businesses profitably without stealing from their customers. If Bitcoin actually works, and works well ($10k/ea, actually being used to process a significant number of transactions) then the next round of ASICs will be produced by the likes of GlobalFoundries or Intel. They\'ll be tiny, fast, low-power, engineered by teams of experienced professionals, cheap, and available -everywhere-. That is a comforting and scary thought. When a PCIe card has 4 ASICs and each runs at 1 TH/s, and can be seen at ark.intel.com? That\'ll be the day Bitcoin mining becomes super serious, and will drive control out of existing ASIC manufacturers who can\'t actually compete at that level. If they are to continue, they\'ll have to purchase someone else\'s hardware. That\'s assuming these large corporations don\'t selfishly mine themselves, or sell only to institutions they have agreements with. I\'m assuming that when the next huge wave of ASICs arrive, I will have the capital to buy them, and that they will be made available for me to buy them. Those are two huge assumptions.\n\nAnyway, this got huge and rambling, but those are my thoughts on the state of profitably mining (apologies to everyone who had to see this, and was annoyed that it didn\'t include market information). And as always, forward looking statements, past performance, future profits, yadda yadda yadda.

Think of it this way, all Bitcoin hardware for miners who buy manufactured hardware pay for that hardware in Bitcoin (those who build their own hardware are in a slightly different boat). So reinvestment remains BTC to BTC for that leg of the transaction, often times for many steps of that transaction before some or all of it is converted to fiat by vendors.\n\nRemember that miners are continually performing hardware refreshes, every few months or better. They can\'t just liquidate everything they mine because it\'ll slow their refresh rate (and thus reduce their competitive edge) and actually expose them to unnecessary USD/BTC volatility, mining hardware is typically denominated in BTC (until very recently this was broadly the case, Bitmain taking a step back from that reflects the abysmal effect that the exchange rate is having on hardware manufacturers, but also mostly impacts smaller "prosumer" miners).\n\nAn efficient operation has investment capital to acquire property and an inexpensive structure, a megawatt or so of the least expensive power available within a distance your budget can afford, and the lowest USD/GH mining hardware you can find. Then you burn that investment capital on power, hoarding coins for about 2 months. At the 2 month mark, you sell your existing hardware, and reinvest some of your earnings to upgrade to the new lowest USD/GH hardware available.\n\nIt\'s hard work, it\'s expensive, it\'s high risk, and currently it\'s dishearteningly meager profits. But I don\'t think most miners take that sort of risk because they want a quick buck.

It\'s a topic that interests me, and, it\'s a topic of great relevance to the crypto markets.  \n\nThere was actually a substantial amount of news in the last couple days but if you weren\'t paying very close attention you may have missed it. I\'m really amazed how subtly the Fed\'s lack of course correction has been woven into business reporting by the press. If you don\'t keep your eyes open it\'s very easy to miss the slow rolling back of their promises to end quantitative easing. \n\nFor example, just last month, FOMC made it quite clear the QE was imminently wrapping up. And the media reported it as if it was a done deal. [Here\'s a quote from Forbes in September:](http://www.forbes.com/sites/investor/2014/09/23/the-end-of-the-qe-era-is-upon-us-whats-next/)\n\n> Quantitative easing as we know it is coming to an end. By the time you read this, it most likely will be over. In itself this is an end of an era. Interest rates will rise unless a new form of interest rate suppression is introduced, which in itself would be another kind of QE.\n\nSounds definitive right? That\'s because the Fed made it clear that QE was done. \n\nOnly it wasn\'t and isn\'t. \n\nWhen FOMC met earlier this month you\'ll notice that there was barely any mention about the end of QE; instead there were vague assurances of continued low interest rates and other programs to prop up the economy. But most media coverage kept referencing the end of QE as if it had actually happened. But behind the scenes, and away from cameras, a totally different conversation was going on. Just yesterday, [look what the Post tucked into an otherwise mundane article](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2014/10/16/a-rocky-start-for-stocks-then-growth-extend-markets-moody-spell/) about the correction on the Dow: \n\n>The market then jumped after St. Louis Fed President James Bullard told Bloomberg TV that the central bank could delay an end to its QE3 bond-buying program, planned to end this month, until later this year.\n\nOh really? Is this a trial balloon ahead of the Oct. 28th Fed meeting? QE isn\'t ending after all? [Is this the QE-infinity some analysts have been expecting since last year?](http://www.cnbc.com/id/101144335) Will QE end or has it become a political impossibility?\n\nI posted this before, but I\'ll remind folks that [Peter Schiff nailed this last week in an interview with Yahoo that, in light of Bullard\'s comments, seems almost prescient:](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/schiff--get-ready-for-qe-infinity-144200323.html)\n\n>"I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they ever had a plan to hike rates, I think their plan is to launch QE 4, but they can\xe2\x80\x99t come out and admit that so they\xe2\x80\x99ve been pretending that they\xe2\x80\x99re gonna raise rates...You\xe2\x80\x99ve got so many people that think the Fed can stop QE because they\xe2\x80\x99re convinced it worked. It hasn\xe2\x80\x99t worked; it\xe2\x80\x99s just made the U.S. economy more dependent than ever on QE and zero percent interest rates."\n\nAnd the kicker that will bring things back to reality?  \n\n>\xe2\x80\x9cI think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a currency crisis,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9ca sovereign debt crisis when the world understands that it\xe2\x80\x99s QE infinity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAccording to Schiff, the dollar is only strong now because the Fed keeps promising to end the QE program. But what if they don\'t? The markets will rejoice yet again, at least in the short term, but the dollar, and the consumer, will get screwed.

Your post is just speculation based on intuition. But your intuition is flawed. Here's why:\n\nSo say someone went all in last bubble at the bottom, put $10,000 into bitcoin and then saw their money increase 10 fold. Your assumption is these people then decided to buy a half million dollar mortgage and an expensive car loan because one asset class they hold went from $10,000 of their portfolio to $100,000? Yeah... no.\n\nFirst of all, ever since the financial crisis of last decade, banks care more about down payments and proven regular income than your assets. That said, I do remember reading a story on /r/bitcoin about someone reporting their bitcoin as an asset of theirs to their bank (and it was a major bank like Chase IIRC) and the bank considered it when giving out the loan. But that is by far the exception, not that rule.\n\nSo since banks care more about down payment and regular income, that means these people taking out enormous loans have already sold enough of their bitcoin to cover the down payment. If these people are just now going bankrupt because of bitcoin's value, that's due to the bank for handing out a loan to such a high risk person who doesn't have a regular income and whose only major assets are a volatile new form of money. But like I said, very few banks are making that kind of mistake these days.\n\nI think it's more likely some people got a bit gambly and put way too much money into bitcoin or tried day trading and failed. But something tells me these people aren't going to sell off their bitcoin to please their bank, or at least not in droves. The ones who bought bitcoin on margin though and wrecklessly daytraded might, but they've already lost tons of money with their recklessness, so they don't even *have* a lot of bitcoins to sell at this point.

I finally got in at $610 because I was skeptical and stubborn. But that stubbornness has saved me from buying at the top of a lot of rallies ($410 last week, $450 a couple weeks ago, etc).

There is a chance that someone is manipulating the price of the TH1 contract.\n\n1. Buy most of the contracts. Establish a floor price of 1.27.  Do not let the floor price fall below 1.27.\n\n2. Make mining dividends - same as usual.\n\n3. Make swap interest. But instead of getting declining swap payments (as the value of the contract shrinks), you actually get increasing swap payments as the contract's premium over its mining worth increases. For instance, on the last day you will be able to make as much as 1.26 BTC by lending out the contract to a shorter.  Now ultimately you will not be able to lend out all of your contracts, but so long as you lend out most of them - and so long as there is strong competition between shorters - you should be able to manipulate the market and make a lot of profit.\n\nThere is unlimited (or near unlimited) demand to short a contract that is over-valued. By contrast the supply of these contracts is limited.\n\nThere is already evidence that this plan works. For instance, until I thought of this - I was interested in investing increasing amounts of money into shorting TH1 - because it looks (on paper) that I stand to make increasing profits.\n\nDo you see any flaws in this reasoning?\n\nIs there any other logical reason for the price holding at 1.27? If the contract price declines at 1/77th per day and you have conservative estimates: difficulty increases by 0% and the swap rate is 0.7%/day - a TH1 contract holder should only break even according to my spreadsheet.\n\nIf this is true, a possible remedy is to constantly increase the supply of the contract.  Even if the manipulator has very deep pockets, the people shorting the contract won't necessarily have them - AND they'll be reluctant to short the contract if manipulation is possible. So the other solution is to educate shorters about this possibility. \n\n\nIf this is true, it is also possible that other people will buy the TH1 with the intention of making a lot of mining dividends and then reselling the contract at 1.27.  This will drive the price of TH1 up. This is fine for the manipulator as they are able to increase their income from swap interest or choose to liquidate part or all of their position.\n\nIs there anyway this could be solved by allowing naked shorting or contracts for difference?": 2, "Have they actually provided any information on their actual mining operations such as whether they actually exist. \n\nEdit: and I'm not just asking because the Bitfinex guy has a shame thread on bitcointalk for being a pirateat40 pumper.

We have frequently posted and told people that the way that new supply is being offered is undergoing review, and that this is an experimental new asset being offered. \n\nIn general, if you think the price is going up, you should buy. If you think it will fall, you should short. Remember that a smart man once said that the market can remain irrational far longer than one can remain solvent. Caveat Emptor.\n\nIf more people are buying than selling, the price goes up. In the reverse situation the price goes down, the same as any asset. \n\nIf you don\'t think that there is adequate supply, or that it is too illiquid, there is always the option to not trade that asset. \n\nBitfinex does not have a horse in this race, we are not the market maker in this asset, and as in all of our other assets, we simply are offering a neutral playing field. \n\nI personally think that nowadays a lot of people are looking for returns in bitcoin terms, and any asset that offers a return is somewhat in demand, this could account for a rising price. As one other person offered, there are expectations about future mining difficulty, and those will be priced into the cost of contract. If you think that difficulty will increase, but not as dramatically as the current price seems to indicate, it might make sense to go long. Again, markets provide a mechanism for individuals to test their theories, and put money behind it. I think there are some parallels to the release of earnings on an equity, there is a general consensus on what the performance "should" be, and depending on how it actually turns out, the price moves accordingly. \n\nAs an aside, I don\'t trade TH1 personally.

Let's try this again.  You'd said:\n\n>the miners will have only 50% as many BTC per day to sell, so the balance swings to more BTC being bought than sold\n\nYour entire premise seems focused on the *quantity* of bitcoins on the buy or sell side ... and the changes that the halvening will bring.  My point is - the *quantity* is largely irrelevant - when miners have real-world costs (i.e.: value) they need to cover.\n\nThink of it another way, think of it when a stock reverse-splits 2:1.  You suddenly now have half as many shares in your account (quantity), but it's worth the same amount (value).  Only, with the BTC halvening scenario -- this doesn't apply to *all bitcoins outstanding* ... only to the new ones being awarded.\n\n>Tell me again why someone would want to do this instead of the first option\n\nThey wouldn't ... that's my point - you seem to think (if I understood you correctly) that the halvening would possibly be *good for bitcoin* ... when in reality, I think it will either be neutral ... or the opposite.": 0, '*Edit: Jump to the bottom because I think I finally figured out what you\'re getting at.*\n\nI read your first two paragraphs and I think you\'re just confused. You seem to be saying that the quantity of bitcoins being sold is irrelevant, because the value of that reward would remain the same. The value is just quantity times price. If the quantity is half of what it was before the Halvening, and the value is the same, the price must have doubled. And that\'s what I was trying to prove that the Halvening would tend to make the price want to go up.\n\n> You suddenly now have half as many shares in your account (quantity), but it\'s worth the same amount (value).\n\nI understand this concept, but it\'s not what\'s happening with the Halvening. The block reward is half of what it was, but it\'s not worth the same because each bitcoin has doubled in price - it\'s worth exactly half of the previous block reward (again, unless the price magically doubles, which would prove my point).\n\n> Only, with the BTC halvening scenario -- this doesn\'t apply to all bitcoins outstanding ... only to the new ones being awarded.\n\nHuh? You seem to be saying that the bitcoins created for the block reward are worth double what they were before the Halvening, because there are only half as many of them, while everyone else\'s bitcoins stay worth as much as they were before the Halvening. That\'s not how it works. A bitcoin is a bitcoin. \n\n> They wouldn\'t ... that\'s my point\n\nSorry, now I\'m completely confused about what you are trying to say. Why did you list "sell more held bitcoins" as a possibility if you think no one would consider to do this? I was advocating option 1 - that miners no longer efficient enough to recoup electricity costs would simply stop mining which is I think what you mean by "exit the market", and please correct me if I\'m wrong about that), and then you came along and listed option 1 side by side with option 2 "sell more held bitcoins ... to cover the shortfall". And then I pointed out that option 2 was ridiculous, and then you agreed. So why did you bring it up?\n\nEdit: Wait, after thinking about it more I think you mean the following: The dollar value of bitcoins being sold by miners will remain the same (i.e. whatever is enough to cover electricity costs), but since each block reward will be worth fewer BTC (12.5 instead of 25), the number of block rewards per day which will be dumped on the market instead of hoarded by miners will be greater. If that\'s what you mean, I completely agree! But it won\'t affect the price negatively like you suggest because the number of BTC (and similarly dollar value) those block rewards represents remains the same!': 2, '> So the total number of bitcoins being sold per day will go from X+Y to X.\n\nI think I see where you\'re getting at with that...  as some miners get priced out (because they go underwater at the halvening and can\'t cover costs) there is less # (and therefore $) being sold.  But if $ amount of demand/interest remains steady on the buy side, it should have an upward effect on prices.  Fair enough.\n\nHowever, I struggle with the concept of *more and more miners getting priced out of the market* as being "good for bitcoin" in the long-run.  In your scenario, miners in camp #1 are still making coins, there are fewer competitors, and now those coins are worth more because there\'s less on the sell side, which lets them plow more $ of R&D into building better ASICs.  This seems like it would create a dangerously self-reinforcing feedback loop which consolidates down to 1 company owning all the mining power ... which seems antithetical to the concept of a "decentralized" currency.  Say hello to your new Chinese overlords who will control your currency.\n\nPersonally, I think BTC will be nearly dead well before then ... so I\'m doubtful we\'ll ever get to see what will happen.  But if we do, it should be interesting.\n\n': 1, 'I\'m glad we\'re making progress. But I don\'t agree with your conclusion, because nothing you\'ve said suggests to me a reason why the "sell-side will increase".\n\nI\'ll reiterate and summarize my main point though.\n\nThere are two types of miners:\n\n1. Those that stay in because they remain profitable. These guys are currently selling X BTC per day.\n\n2. Those that drop out because they are no longer profitable. These guys are currently selling Y BTC per day.\n\nMy claim is: After the Halvening, miners in camp 1 will continue to sell the same number of bitcoins they did before to cover their costs which are the same. This may be a greater proportion of the total bitcoins created per day, but that\'s irrelevant.\n\nMiners in camp 2 will no longer be selling any bitcoins.\n\nSo the total number of bitcoins being sold per day will go from X+Y to X. If one assumes the demand for new bitcoins stays the same on the buy side, then the price *should* increase to compensate for reduced quantity being sold.\n\nEdit: The size of the effect will of course depend on the relative sizes of X and Y.': 2, "I've heard this theory a lot on this subreddit.

Thank you!': 1, "NOT_SURE: Did you check out the [swap calculators](http://bfxdata.com/calculators/swaps.php) on bfxdata? It should give you some idea on what returns you could expect: \n\nif you offer a swap @ current rate (= 0.095 % per day) (obviously I can't tell you if future rates will be higher or lower) of $1000 and you'll have autorenw activated, in theory you could see a total return of ~$147 (fee already substracted) after 6 months. This is uncompounded and assumes you'll have the swap active the entire 6 months. \n\nIn reality the return will be lower, as the swap won't be active the whole period (does depend on the rate you offer the swap) if you offer below the current rate swaps are taken much faster, however your return will be lower than can be if you offer at higher, more competitive rates. I have an active swap at the moment that has been active for 22 days now, but when it was taken swap rates were significantly lower than current rates.\n\nProfits could be higher as well, as you can offer the returns of your swap (payed daily), which will in turn also generate interest. If You compound the interest swap returns could be up to ~$160 for the entire period, again assuming that the swap will be active the entire period, rate remains the same and also the payed interest are also offered in active swaps.": 2, "> interest rates will wipe you out slowly but surely \n\nI don't understand. If I am the one lending money, I would be collecting interest.\n\n> you will get margin called\n\nI thought only the borrower gets margin called, not the lender. \n\nThank you for your advice. Would you mind clarifying this? ": 4, "The rates are decent right now, but yields are falling as more and more lenders put their funds into swaps. So I wouldn't count on any guaranteed returns for the long term (at least not with current rates).": 2, "You should first expect to become familiar with www.bfxdata.com. Bfxdata will allow you to see the order book along with historical swap trade rates and volumes. This information can be incredibly informative when determining the rate and duration of your swap offer (as well as whether or not to mark it as flash return rate, henceforth FRR). So get used to it, and if you find yourself heavily relying on it (as you should), you may want to tell admin@bitfinex.com and support@bitfinex.com to configure your account to send a portion of your exchange fees to the operator of bfxdata (/u/bfxdata). This will not cost anything extra.\n\nThere are two types of orders you can send: fixed rate and floating rate (FRR). When sending a fixed rate order, you specify a rate (in daily terms; not an annualized rate) to receive over the duration of the order. When sending a floating rate order, the rate will adjust hourly to be based on the average rate of all outstanding fixed rate swaps. Your orders will be executed when there is an opposing order for the specified rate and duration. There are commonly times when rates are crossed in the order book (e.g. an order to demand a .08% 30-day swap and an order to offer a 0.07% 2-day swap will not execute against each other). Also, there are commonly times where FRR orders are entirely absent or just present on the demand side or the offer side. It is important to pay attention to those dynamics when choosing your order's parameters.\n\nSwap demand positions can be prepaid at any time after one hour. It used to be the case that they could be paid off any time after they were taken, but this led to perceived abuse of swap rates. Looking at the [6-month historical USD swap history](http://bfxdata.com/swaphistory/usd.php), you can see the impact this change (which occurred in early July) had on overall USD swap volume as well as rates. Because swap demand positions can be prepaid, they are encouraged to actively participate in the swap market to reduce the cost of their leveraged positions. Swap offer positions, on the contrary, cannot be called back before the end of the duration. This severely restricts the abilities of participants offering swaps. Because of these restrictions, fixed rate swaps are overwhelmingly offered at the shortest duration (two days). Likewise, swap demands are commonly set to the longest duration possible as they can choose to prepay their swap.\n\nIt is impossible to predict what your return will be for 6 months, and there are no types of instruments (swaps, futures, or options) offered by Bitfinex to allow you to attempt to lock in such a rate for that long. If you want to base your prediction on the past, there seems to be a comfortable floor at 0.04% per day. A common benchmark of average swap offering performance is the FRR. A common strategy to achieve this benchmark is to set the autorenew feature for 30 days at FRR. This strategy works very well when there is heavy demand for FRR (and heavy demand in general). From around February (and likely before) to July, there was much more USD demand than supply. From July to August, with 30 million USD in actively used swaps and a declining BTCUSD price (reducing the leverage of BTCUSD longs with BTC as collateral), the USD swap market was awash with offers and those following the autorenew FRR strategy were extremely lucky to find a day where their FRR order executed. \n\nAs the USD swap market changes, so should your expectations. Keep in mind that the FRR is an average; there are plenty of active fixed rate swaps at rates higher than the FRR. A 30-day autorenew FRR strategy will miss the upside of rates higher than FRR as well as face intense competition when USD supply outstrips demand.

Personally, I wouldn't expect real estate to do well over the course of a major stock market correction, either, so that doesn't sound like a great candidate.\n\nUnless there are good alternatives that I don't know about (and there may very well be, hence why I'm asking), bitcoin seems like a good potential place to stick some money when you're bearish about the market in general. We may not have seen this come to fruition yet, but maybe in the future.": 5, 'I agree. If Bitcoin is still around it 20 years, then I would imagine it will have a price behavior similar to gold. You really need at least a few decades of history behind something before people will consider it a safe store of value. ': 1, "It's almost like all these state currencies are moving together": 2, 'For sure, because it\'s gaining value so quickly. That\'s what i meant here:\n\n>BTC is negatively correlated with US dollar performance with a drift; i.e. BTC will move inversely to the dollar, with the note that BTC has a strong positive value gain trend.\n\nWe\'re saying the same thing. The relationship is there, but BTC is gaining value so quickly beyond the marginal relationship beyond the currency pair relationship that you don\'t get the "correlation" appearance.\n\nIt\'s there, and visible when BTC is stable and USD was gaining a few weeks ago, for example. For the majority of the time though, it\'s buried underneath the appreciation in value.': 4, 'I believe it\'s a coincidence. Gold tends to be seen as a safe-haven and store of value, so as the markets rally, gold will decline or stagnate, and vice versa.  The market has been pretty frothy lately, and as this recent decline occurred (and Gold was breaking below significant long term resistance levels) we saw a rush away from the market and into safe havens.  Gold has rallied in conjunction, and the market has trailed downwards.\n\nSo the real question should be "is the current stock market pullback driving the current rise in Bitcoin?"\n\nI believe the answer to that is no.  Bitcoin is very susceptible to momentum and market sentiment.  Sentiment has been rather bearish for much of 2014, and as expected, the price has fallen significantly during that time period.  The bearish sentiment only increased as we moved lower and lower, and momentum truly took control.  But the "slaying of the bearwhale" signaled a shift in momentum because it gave the market place a "victory".  Despite the fact that the price was still significantly lower than only a week before, when people started commenting on that Monday morning after the bottom was reached, people were suddenly a little optimistic because of that small victory.  After that, more demand started arriving and the price increased, which brought more people into the trade and drove the price up further.  Momentum has now swung back towards the bullish side.  However, on the longer term, we\'re still firmly in a bear market.\n\nSo no, I don\'t think Gold and BTC are correlated.  BTC is not a safe haven by any stretch of the word.  If I was going to say BTC was correlated to anything, I\'d probably lean towards the US Dollar.\n\nEdit: Thanks for the Gold!': 20, 'Yes, I did mean irrational.  Thanks for pointing that out.  I\'ve gone back and made that small edit to my original comment so as not to confuse anyone else.\n\nWith the negative bond yields, yeah, it really doesn\'t make a lot of sense for people to be paying for a negative yield, but it just goes to show how dire the market was at the time.  As for why we saw negative yields at all, well, a lot of major companies are required to hold large reserves to offset their risk assets.  For the most part, they don\'t want to only be in hard currency because they don\'t gain any yield there.  So they will usually choose US Gov bonds because they are considered the gold standard for safety and they offer some small yield compared to sitting in hard currency.  But with lots of companies running towards the exit doors at once, the prices of the bonds spiked, which inversely causes the yields to contract.  The yields eventually went negative.  Not by crazy amounts, but negative none the less.  That\'s how bad the drop was getting.  Major companies were more comfortable paying for a fixed rate small loss just so they could get their risk assets off the table without incurring any further losses.  But why not just go to all cash?  Well, the value of USD can fluctuate as well.  The only thing that confuses me though is that the US Dollar was spiking during the crash.  During that time the trade was "Dollar up = Crude Down = Market Up", so realistically they could have moved to cash and not suffered the fixed rate loss.  So I guess I don\'t have a good answer there.  It baffles me as well.': 2, 'Paging /u/lalicat !!!!\n\nWe tried this over a year ago I  think.  He even had a wiki tied to it. \n': 4, "Great post.

I was familiar with the dark markets and saw that there was some real utility there, but didn't look into it much beyond that.  I didn't buy or sell then.\n\nWhen the November bubble hit, I was surprised and started to really look into the technology.  I figured I had missed the boat as far as profiting off the rise, so was content to wait and see.  I guess I'm not susceptible to FOMO.\n\nI didn't think about it much for a while, but when the price hit around $500 in March, I figured the time wasn't bad for getting in.  I made some small buys, and continued to do so on the way down.  I thought the market was oversold and, while I wasn't going to time the bottom, in the long run it wouldn't make a huge difference.  I stopped buying before the April mini-bubble, and recently made a few more buys at the recent bottom, lowering my cost basis a small amount.\n\nOverall, my investment strategy is based on the assumption that bitcoin will be quite valuable in ~5 years time.  After that point, competing technologies will have to be strongly considered, but until then I don't see it going to 0.  As such, I'm content to hold and buy whenever the market seems oversold.  I don't plan on selling much in the next couple years, though I may do a little profit taking if things look significantly overbought.\n\n_____\nWatching the markets has been very interesting.  I've never closely observed a market before, and this has been a great opportunity to consistently make predictions and see what results.

I had always been into building computers as a hobby so he assumed I knew about it, which was partially true: I read about Bitcoin back in 2012 but dismissed it. They weren\'t very valuable at the time and it was even riskier to invest back then, not to mention the negative media. It\'s hard to imagine now, but hindsight is 20/20, as they say.\n\nI bought a few coins on the way up to $266 but didn\'t dig deeper into the protocol and economy until later in the year. As I read about how Bitcoin really worked "under the hood" I realized it could be a financial game-changer and devoted more time to it. I figured $100 was a pretty good price to accumulate coins. I was actually involved in a couple of large ASIC chip orders to build my own miners, but that eventually fell through as I vastly underestimated the explosion in mining interest and the price increase later that year. So I held the coins instead. Now I have 90% of that stash in cold storage and trade with the other 10%.\n\nI started with basic TA and attempted to call/time the market using one or two indicators. I did this in my head as I watched the markets to practice. Obviously this is not how TA works, and one of the major misconceptions about it is that it\'s some kind of "magic" that works all the time. Nope, it is not that, which I realized quickly. I also realized that digital currency markets move and react to news and events in a particular way and there were repeatable and somewhat predictable patterns. This comes from experience. Trade what you know, and you\'d better know Bitcoin. Learn how the protocol works and immerse yourself in the community for some time before you begin risking capital. Don\'t forget about altcoin markets... as pump & dump as they are they teach you how whales operate on a smaller scale. Don\'t forget to experience the trollboxes on altcoin exchanges and how they\'re designed to seperate newbies from their money. The more you understand about how these little things play into the big picture, the better.\n\nOnce you have some experience you can use basic TA (support/resistance/trend following) to be profitable. I recommend reading "Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets" by John Murphy. It will teach you the basics and there it\'s invaluable information presented in a simple, no nonsense fashion. I\'m sure there are other great books out there as well, but I keep it nearby at all times and refer to it frequently.\n\nThis year I started using custom algorithmic traders. They are excellent at taking the emotion out of the trade, but their profitability will depend on how well they are programmed. I still trade manually when I have free time.

That said, I am very conservative with my trades. If I\'m not sure what to do, I don\'t trade. Also, I DO NOT trade on margin but it\'s important to keep your eye on bfxdata.com to see what sentiment is like. My coin holdings are up around 150% thanks to the recent bear market. As I\'m typing this we just blew through $410. Now we ride the train up.\n\nFull disclosure, i don\'t do this full time and I have no experience trading any financial markets previous to Bitcoin.

At ~$600/coin that would get you ~30K coins.  These you dump on the markets in batches of 400-1000 coins in periods of low velocity.

One bit that makes such a simulation difficult is that you don't know when a long swap will be prepaid early.
