People are being hopeful and depending on the current limit of 21 million BTC divided by the current amount of user currency and then assigning said value to each bitcoin. This is wrong for two main reasons and several smaller ones. Here are the main reasons:\n\n* The 21 million limit isn't a hard limit. It can be changed at any time through a fork. Anyone who understands currencies understands that a hard-capped currency cannot succeed long term. \n\n* It assumes Bitcoin will become the dominant form of exchange and trade, which, let's be honest, won't ever happen.

So doing the math, 1 BTC would be worth about $5.4million.  Assuming we max out at 21 million BTC, the price would be $3.85million.  Those are obviously extremely ambitious numbers, but demonstrate the theoretical value 1BTC could hold if the arguably ideal scenario would pan out.  As such, a $1mil bitcoin COULD be possible, but it would probably need to approach the adoption level of a major currency (USD, Euro, etc.) to do so.\n\nNow let\'s come back from the moon a bit and think a bit more realistically.  Right now, Bitcoin is in its infancy (well, perhaps it\'s a toddler now -- but still really young) and there are, relatively speaking, very few current Bitcoin users.  IMO, the primary reason Bitcoin has traditionally been volatile has been the uncertainty behind its viability.  As hurdles like scalability, usability, and accessibility are jumped, more users will be attracted to Bitcoin and existing users will likely want to invest even more.  Plus the "new" supply of Bitcoin will only keep decreasing over time -- further making any increased demand drive the price up.\n\nI suppose if you were to look at data from an exchange (like number of new unique users every day and average user volume) and come up with some numbers that suggest the demand for Bitcoin will more than double by the end of the year, you could argue for a $1000 pricepoint by the end of the year.  Plus, if you want to attract more users, there is no better way than giving a bullish assessment of Bitcoin.\n\nBut like any market, the price tends to stabilize to a certain point until acted upon by a stimulus -- at which point the price tends to oscillate then stabilize at another price point until another stimulus. I\'m sure I\'m missing some, but the obvious upcoming stimuli are the halving of the block reward, block size debate, segwit, lightning networks, etc.  The halving is of course predictable, so I don\'t expect that to have much impact on price (it\'ll likely be "built in").  There are a few scenarios I can come up with in my head for the other issues, that would be a big enough stimulus to drive the price trend in either direction.  This post is long enough and I\'m still trying to assess the feasibility of these scenarios so I won\'t speculate about them here\n\nSo all of that said, I could see how people can come up with numbers predicted Bitcoin will be at $1000 by the end of the year, but at the same time I could see Bitcoin also being at $100 by the end of the year.  In reality, it\'s very likely to be somewhere in between (yeah I\'m giving a very narrow range of price here).  So basically, it comes down to trying to understand the motivations of people\'s assessments, researching the fundamentals, assessing the risks, and making your decision.\n\n': 8, "Example.

Currently most buyers are just speculating that the price will continue growing.  Such speculations aren\'t sustainable, it\'s a bit like the tulip mania, at some point it may crack and the bitcoin will become worthless.  I believe the real, sustainable value in bitcoins lies in the potential to become THE standard for online payments in the future.  Once it\'s possible to buy bread anywhere in the world by bitcoins, and we have 21 million people wanting to have in average the worth of 10 breads in their bitcoin wallet ... then the bitcoin will for sure be worth more than 10 breads.  Scale that up a bit, and add 210 million people from the middle class in average wanting to have sufficient balance in the wallet to replace the fridge and repair the car if it should be needed ... and the BTC value will climb to the moon, and it will be sustainable.  But we\'ll never get there with a low transaction limit.\n\nAs for the "blocks being 75 - 80 % full on the average", that already sounds like a disaster to me.  Keep in mind that there will always be mined some empty blocks, that not all miners would bother to fill up their blocks, and that the traffic volume varies greatly dependent on the time of the day, time of the week, special events, etc.  I\'m already seeing quite often that transactions get stuck for several hours, even when paying a "decent" fee (i.e. chosing "normal" in the mycelium wallet).  This for sure scares away many newcomers; and we need a continuous inflow of new users to keep the price increasing.\n\nOn the merchant side too - zero-conf used to be safer than credit card payments, it may not be the case any more.

Every hand the house takes money off the table, so if you could beat the rake you were doing okay (i.e., the game wasn't beating you). But look at the exchanges. Every trade on Bitfinex has a *minimum* of .1% go to the house (and could be as high as .30%), and that's assuming the maker has traded enough volume to pay no fees and the taker has traded huge volume as well. I'd guess the average total fee per combined order on bitfinex is about .15 to .2 percent. Price is where it was 20 days ago on BFX but BFX has had 619,686 bitcoin pass through it's engine in that time (taking the 30 days volume, multiplying by .66. not perfect but gives an idea). At an average of 0.15% per bitcoin traded that's 929 bitcoin (~$343k, or about $17k / day). At an average of .2 that's 1,239 bitcoin (about $458k, or $22.9k / day). At an average of .25 that's 1,549 bitcoin (about $573k, or about $29k/ day).

The self-interested reason is that as a business using Bitcoin, it simply makes business sense to keep a local, verified copy of the blockchain for triple-entry accounting and to make sure your local systems are in sync with the chain\n\n2. From an altruistic point of view, when a business does this, it is essentially auditing the blockchain, and adding trustworthiness and security to it.  This is what is meant by being a "fully validating node."  It is also helping to route transactions to other nodes.\n\nMany individuals run nodes to help support the network.  These individuals aren\'t making economic use of the node - these are not "fully validating" nodes, but just relays.  Note that if you are one of these, and your network is not *above average*, you may be hurting, not helping transaction propagation.\n\nIt turns out that the dual functions of (1) validating the blockchain and (2) relaying have different needs.  With respect to #1, there really can\'t be too many fully validating nodes.  The more people who transact on the blockchain and audit those transactions through a fully-validating node, the more reliable that data becomes.  But with regard to #2, there is such a thing as too many nodes.  The network does not need a node for each user, and ideally, only people with very high bandwidth would run nodes.\n\nIf you assume strong adoption, such that lots of businesses are accepting and transacting Bitcoin, the network should produce more than enough high-speed, fully-validating nodes to keep transactions validated relayed very efficiently.\n\nThis idea that individuals in their basements are what keeps the network secure is silly and detrimental to Bitcoin.': 1, "Market is down in part due to core's governance.

But if I place a sell order for that 1 BTC and try to place a margin position for even 2 BTC at 5x long, it says I have insufficient funds. For instance: say the price is $350 and I am holding 1 BTC, if I place a sell order at $360 for that 1 BTC and try to go 5x short at $360 with 2 BTC at the same time, it won\'t let me. Although I should be able to place upwards of 5 BTC short, which I could do whether I was holding the 1 BTC at $360 or hold $360 in my account. Realistically, regular trades should have no effect on margin trades (minus the couple dollars in fees, etc).

So here\'s my story: I\'ve been long since ~\xe2\x82\xac345 and waiting for a good time to close and potentially open another one after a pullback (actually had a long lower than that but it got stop-loss hunted JUST before we started our rise a couple days ago, but we all know about manipulative stop-loss hunting and this post isn\'t about that). So when we hit \xe2\x82\xac364 I was getting to the point of feeling like we were at the top for now and went to close my position. Now, when I close my positions, I always, always, **ALWAYS** go to the position and click on the fill order form button so I don\'t accidentally enter an incorrect amount (and yes, I double check it as well). So I filled the order form of a 10 BTC sell (my entire position) and entered a price of \xe2\x82\xac364.3999 (just below the lowest ask of \xe2\x82\xac364.40. I know, I\'m a horrible person) but changed my mind and just entered \xe2\x82\xac364.0 instead because I wanted to close my position and was more likely with a lower price. Now go back and take a look at my screenshot. 0.9989 BTC sold for \xe2\x82\xac364.3999. Neither of which I had submitted as a trade. That\'s not all. Shortly after submitting the trade, my internet crashed (you can see in my screenshot that my dropbox was still connecting). When it came back, the price had just crashed $7. Well how\'s that for a coincidence? \n\nThat other open order you see was the stop-loss from the long that was opened days ago which I closed minutes later (after getting a few error messages about being unable to do so).\n\nThere is definitely some shady stuff going on. You can see I had taken the earlier screenshots on Feb 4th and may wonder why I hadn\'t posted with them earlier. Well I did start typing up a comment about the issue but refrained because it was getting to the point of "manipulation" and people here like to turn a blind eye to such things. On that day I was actually tempted to close my short at that time because I felt we were near the bottom and those site issues keeping me from accessing orders/positions gave me a funny feeling of manipulation and that we were going to start going up. Instead I adjusted my stop-loss to ~$5 above the price which was hit a few hours later. (If you look back at Feb 4th you\'ll see a ~$20 pump that day).\n\n**TL:DR** - attempted to close my long at the top, trade that went through was *conveniently* less than 10% of what my actual order was, internet *mysteriously* goes down right after, when it comes back, price had dropped \xe2\x82\xac7. /rant': 6, "Huobi, Bitstamp and OKcoin volumes are normal, it's only BFX and it could be related to that 8 mil of longs being closed.

Overlaying that on this movement, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve already passed the target at the breakout point.  \n\nNow, if I had ignored the drop to $360 the other day, we would be breaking out from 2 boxes higher.  That means the predictions for the column high would be $460 based on the fourteen columns width theory.  The last breakout count theory would put the price objective at at $400.  Again,  quite divergent targets.  This is what happens with very wide formations.\n\nSee what I mean?  This is kind of screwy.\n\nSo, here is what I am looking for:\n\n1.  A move into the $410-415 box would trigger the long pole warning.  It means we\xe2\x80\x99ve broken resistance and there is blue sky above.  Except when it turns.  If it hits that box and turns downward, expects a drop at least half the length of the column.  And that would happen fast.\n2. We could fail to get through this current set of resistance.  That would mean the price would reverse in to a column of Os.  That would happen on a day when it dropped below $385 without hitting a new high.  So, while it could reverse later this afternoon, it is not going to happen until tomorrow.\n3. A drop to $375 would mean the formation is not broken.  That would set the new formation level at 15 columns.  That would simply add to the velocity and ferocity of the next break.\n\nWhat is my guess?  And this is an educated, conservative guess:\n\nI think we probably move up through the resistance into the $410-20 range.  And then tomorrow when China is open and the US is not, it reverses.  I have to believe there are some margin calls coming in as the Far East opens tomorrow.  I am going to ride the upward movement.  I am going to skim some profits every couple of bucks and wait for the reversal around the same range.\n\nI took a good chunk of my trading profits last night.  I was a few bucks early, but those proceeds are dry and ready to get back into the fight.  You never go broke taking a profit.\n\nSo, Happy valentines Day to the rest of the world.  Here\xe2\x80\x99s hoping that some knucklehead in the Middle East doesn\xe2\x80\x99t do something stupid and cause more problems.  Here is hoping that the SCOTUS issues do not become bigger in the US.  And finally, I hope any movements in China overnight tonight and tomorrow are moderate and orderly.\n\nI would hate to awaken to a shit storm on Monday morning.\n\n[Chart of the Day](http://i.imgur.com/ZnMJMLw.png)\n\n\nResources\n\n*[Dorsey-Wright, the best source of PnF Information](http://dorseywright.com/education/point-and-figure-glossary)*\n\n*[Investor Intelligence explanation of PnF Charts](http://www.investorsintelligence.com/x/using_point_and_figure_charts.html)\n\n*[Market Edge Explanation of  PnF Charts](http://www.marketedge.com/MarketEdge/DRME/drPFChart.aspx)\n\n*[Stockcharts](http://support.stockcharts.com/forums/30077/entries/21293)\n\n\n': 20, "No doubt we can see some nice margin calls if this keeps up, but my guess is that the biggest short side whales on okcoin futures are miners with a hedge.

If you're actually using bitcoin for a transactional (rather than speculative) purpose, then it doesn't matter at all how fair the distribution was or how far into the distribution we are. For example, take a guy who buys bitcoin in Chinese for Chinese renminbi and then sells it in Canada for Canadian dollars. He may only be in bitcoin for minutes or even seconds. He doesn't care.\n\n2. When it comes to speculation, I disagree with your premise that bitcoin becomes less attractive as we get further into mining. Bitcoin will likely become *more* appealing as more of it is mined. As more of it is mined, the ratio of new supply that's coming onto the market (potentially to be dumped by miners) becomes smaller and smaller as a percentage of the total bitcoin out there. Some argue that this is precisely why gold is so much more valuable than, say, silver. The amount of new silver supply that comes onto the market compared to the existing stock of silver is actually very high. And when the price of silver goes up, new production and recycling increases the supply of silver much more quickly than can be done with gold. With gold, there's so much gold aboveground compared to new gold production that new supply will barely change the total amount of gold in existence. Gold holders know that there's not suddenly going to be some huge supply increase that renders their gold less valuable. \n\nThis ratio of existing stock to the flow of new supply is called the stock-to-flow ratio.\n\nHere, we can see the stock to flow ratio of gold, silver, and bitcoin on various dates (which is reasonably knowable because of bitcoin's controlled supply). \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/ml5o2UR.png\n\nWe can see that the new supply of bitcoin that's coming to the market is still relatively high compared to gold's. Bitcoin may become much more attractive in the coming years when new supply (daily block reward) becomes insignificant.

This creates a positive break out situation.  The reason why this may be better than most think is that the formation is wide, AND the last break out was pretty decent.\n\nThe last break out was 11 columns high.  From the low point of this column, overlaying the 11 box movement, we reach an objective of $420.\n\nThe width of the formation is 10 columns.  If you add that to the top of the current break out, the result is an objective of $435.\n\nBoth of these predictors point to breaking the downward trend.  If that happens, we get back on the bull wagon.\n\nOur reversal point has now moved to $370.  \n\nAs we all know, this formation has been a long time brewing.  Look for resistance at obvious points, such as $400 and again, right before we reverse the trend between $410-$415.\n\nAs a long term bull, it is nice to see this bounce the right way.

That\'s a fallacy.  Also, I don\'t buy the stance ... "we can alter the rules as much as we want, if and only if we do it as a soft fork".  Would it be OK to raise the 21 MBTC ceiling through a soft fork?\n\nSticking to "... but Satoshi said"-arguments are also a fallacy, but zero tolerance towards rule changes is sort of the same anyway ... "Satoshi put down those rules, so let\'s stick to them".  Hence, I will run through some "Satoshi wrote ..."-arguments.\n\nThe 1MB-limit is a limit to growth.  Bitcoin will never become relevant with such a limit in place.  The limit wasn\'t there from the beginning, it was thrown in as a temporary protection against DoS-attacks or spam or maybe both, and Satoshi has explicitly stated that it should be lifted at some point.\n\nRegarding the 21 MBTC coin cap, I believe Satoshi has said that this can become a problem if at some time the "base unit" (1 satoshi = 1/100000000 BTC) will have a significant value.  In that case, the algorithms should be changed so that we can divide it further, into nano-bitcoins or pico-bitcoins or whatever.  This is legitimate, but it will also require a hard fork.\n\nChanging the 21MBTC cap *will* cause the BTC value to collapse, hence there is currently no economic incentive to propose such a change.  What if the circumstances changes?  What if the supermajority of the Bitcoin community at some point will come to think that the Bitcoin project will fail unless we prolong the miner subsidy.

If 'decentralization' were the true objective, clearly an increase in blocksize to distribute mining activities would be the real objective.\n\nIMHO, a true 'decentralized' currency would work towards a de facto policy of no more than 50% hash power in any one political jurisdiction. The effort by many right now seems to just pander to the centralized chinese miners.\n\nGiven this situation, the easiest 51% attack would just be for the Chinese gov to nationalize all bitcoin industry, and overnight without a single yuan spent, they would capture the network. That is a *huge* risk that no one seems to address.\n\nThat, and the total clusterfucks known as RBF, Segwit, and LN just scream 'no confidence' to my mind.": 1, 'yeah-- there are a lot of shaky assertions going on here.': 3, "> Why would they laugh it? And who is they? If people are willing to pay 50 cents or more for a blockchain transaction thats not a joke. Only a fool would laugh at that.

There are some mixed signals on whom will and whom will not support classic.  I believe that some of the pools (enough to block classic) are supportive of classic, but will postpone using it until it seems blatantly obvious that we will get a successful hard fork (without a 25% minority sticking to their guns on 1MB block limit).\n\n>  If its lifted the way Bitcoin Classic propose, it will be a blow to the soundness of bitcoin, and then even the 21M limit on bitcoin is no longer a limit. If you can change significant things in bitcoin, without consensus, the experiment is basically failed.\n\nYou can\'t change significant things in bitcoin without consensus.  It needs to be supported by a super majority of the hashing power, a majority of the economically active non-mining nodes, as well as a super-majority of the  exchanges and other significant businesses dealing with bitcoins.\n\nAnd the 1MB limit is not a significant thing even!  I believe we\'ve been discussing this ceiling since 2013 without moving significantly forward.  Now, how can you imagine the 21M limit be moved?

For comparison, VISA is doing roughly 172,800,000 transactions/day. Currently bitcoin is capable of roughly 1/600 of just what VISA can do.\n\nIf you upped the blocksize to 500 mb (forget 2 or 20, lets jump right to the big numbers) that gets bitcoin to 129,600,000 tx/day, just starting to catch up to VISA. Sounds pretty good right? On paper that sounds well and good, but that means the blockchain would grow 720 gigabytes per day, and bitcoin would still not even be able to keep up with just VISA alone. That amount of data would be unsustainable. Heck even a much smaller blocksize would be unsustainable. \n\nTo me, this says that in order for bitcoin to be able to accept a non negligible amount of new users, scaling solutions will have to be deployed that allow for far greater throughput than just a simple blocksize increase. The linear solution is simple, but it is also insufficient. \n\nCore devs have already said that the blocksize will need to be increased in the future. That is a given. However, what is being worked on now should be whatever brings orders of magnitude improvements on bitcoin's throughput and, most importantly, while not compromising its solid foundation of decentralization. \n\n(As an aside, this is all assuming comparing VISA and bitcoin is even valid, which is another discussion altogether. However, for the sake of arguing that all transactions should occur directly on the blockchain, the comparison is works. )": 0, "sure but my guess is that your gut-feeling is probably more skewed.

My belief is that Bitcoin will become irrelevant if the blocks go permanently full for a longer period.  It won't be a functional peer-to-peer electronic cash system anymore, and then it loses appeal.  There will be plenty of competitors to pick up the users where Bitcoin fail.\n\nAs for the micropayment channels from 21 inc, I utterly fail to see the selling point.  One is supposed to use the millibitcoins earned from on-chip-mining on content.  The thing with the micropayment channel is that one can keep a stream of some few microbitcoins pr second flowing from the client to the merchant without it involving on-chain transactions, but it's required with on-chain transactions to open and close the channel.  That is, you'll end up spending two on-chain transactions for paying the merchant 2 mBTC for a service that is lasting over a couple of hours.  It's for sure elegant, but honestly ... I think a centralized wallet at the 21inc servers could have done the job better.\n\nLightning channels is dependent on a well-working blockchain, as opening and closing channels requires on-chain transactions.  If the blocks will be permanently full, most likely the lightning network will never come to fruition - and even if lightning was a feasible option for paying for my breakfast coffee today, it would still require far more than 1MB blockspace for serving a transaction volume in the same league as visa.\n\nSo far nobody has come up with a working, implemented routing algorithm as far as I've understood.  You need wallet software that supports those channels.  I do believe in the vision, we can't keep all the worlds coffee-sized transactions on the blockchain - but I believe it will be many years until it will become feasible to pay for the coffee through the lightning network.\n\nAnd even though all this, I'm an optimist.  I believe we will get a 2 MB hard fork in 2016, probably coming from Core, probably voted for by some 90% of the miners within weeks after release, and it will probably be a smooth and unproblematic ride.  In addition the SegWit discount will increase the effective block space further.

When you look at this, you are going to say I got some \xe2\x80\x98splainin\xe2\x80\x99 to do.\n\nWe dropped down to $360 yesterday, and from what I can gather it was a single trade or one fat finger trade.  Never the less, it dropped the chart down below the negative break down point, and then reversed right back up.\n\nI have explained in my charts that every trade is counted, even those that do not make any sense to the anyone paying attention.  As it goes, \xe2\x80\x9cIt is what it is.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nWell, since we broke down we chart it, close out the day and move on.\n\nThis morning, it clearly moves back up into a column of Xs.  But that move will not be confirmed until the \xe2\x80\x9cend of the day\xe2\x80\x9d because it may reverse and drop twenty points back to the $360 range.  That is why the right-most column is currently shaded\xe2\x80\x94to remind me that it is not \xe2\x80\x9cconfirmed.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHere come the things to watch:\n\nThe break out point dropped $5 down to $390.  That is pretty clear to where we are today.\n\nThe trend reversal is now at $395.  This is also pretty close.\n\nThe formation is now 14 columns wide.  This is a very wide formation.    The price has tried to break $360 twice in this formation, and failed.  This is a good sign.\n\nWith a formation this wide (14 columns) the battle between long and shorts must be getting exhausted.  Whichever way it breaks, it should move quickly.\n\nIf we break out this time, we will do a few significant things:\n\n1.  If there is a break out, we take out the trend line.  This will revert to a bullish trend.\n2. If we break out we will go through the conjunction of the trend line from the recent highs, AND the support line coming up from the most recent low of 198.  That is significant because that line is a long term resistance line.\n\nIf we fall through $360..look out below.  There is nothing down there.\n\nSo, what do I think?\n\nThe trend is still downward, but if the price continues to move in this narrow range we will break through in a couple of days\xe2\x80\x94by default.  As you can see the trend line (the little + signs moving from the top left towards the bottom right) moves down one box for each column.  It would only take a couple of trips within our range to hit it just \xe2\x80\x9cbecause.\xe2\x80\x9d  While this is a bullish sign\xe2\x80\xa6it does not happen with any conviction.\n\nIF the price moves above $385, it might be a good time to close out your shorts as it moves towards $390.  If the price hits $390 I would open a trade and watch closely for the pop.  Will this happen before Monday?  Without significant Chinese involvement, I do not think so.\n\nThe gyrations of the regular market (stock and metals, etc) are making me nervous.  I spent some time yesterday moving some money into cash, a little more into silver, and I cleared out 1/2 of my silver options yesterday figuring it would probably drop a bit today.

And how much cash do you want laying around the house.\n\nI hope you all have a happy valentines day with those you care about.

When I am looking at that I use 45-50:1 as a target; that is where its been in the past decade or so (If I remember correctly.)

That can only be interpreted as you saying it is unreasonable to fear a contentious HF.\n\nBut that\'s ridiculous.  Markets sell when they think others might sell.  That\'s why uncertainty moves them.  So for big money, the threat of a contentious HF creates a reasonable fear that people will sell.  Moreover, there is a real possibility that a schism in the chain results in neither chain retaining value (people may move to ab alt, or never return).

If there is a schism, there *could* be a lot of selling as the market has no idea which will be the "real" Bitcoin.  You\'re saying that\'s unreasonable.  Regardless, markets often react to unreasonable fears.  Accordingly, it becomes reasonable for the speculator to exit.\n\nThis is the whole reason markets respond poorly to uncertainty.\n\nAs this Classic thing blows over (regardless of reasons) certainty is being interjected back into the marketplace.

People will devote their entire lives to stockpiling as much fiat as they can without so much as visiting the federal reserve Wikipedia page. The federal reserve and other central banks can publicly list exactly how they operate on their own website and on wikipedia, plain as day for all to see, and they can rest assured that no one will give a shit.": 9, 'This fucking comment again. Do you actually even involve yourself in the blossoming global bitcoin community? ': 2, '[removed]': 2, 'Point and Figure Chart of the Day\n\nSorry for missing yesterday. It was a day full of doctor appointments for the old folks.\n\nSo, we are still in a column of Xs.  The price moved up a box yesterday, climbing to a high of $420.  This morning, we moved higher to $423.\n\nThe price is in a positive break out, with the price objectives between $425 and $435.  This is based on (1) a count of the formation width (3 columns) counted up from the Positive Break out Point.  The second method, the overlay of the last break out onto this column   That breakout (just last week) is nine boxes high.  That brings us to the $435 level.\n\nRecall that there were a couple of days of changing columns based on isolated trades on the Coinbase exchange.  Those changes would have eliminated the past two reversals.  This is the first time in a long time where my sticking to the rules is going to affect my predictions.   \n\nHere are the reasons why.  Without the one trade low and the reversal associated with it have created a new formation.  If we drop the small reversal and do the \xe2\x80\x9cformation count\xe2\x80\x9d method, we would be adding 14 boxes on top of the break out point at  $390.  That would bring the target for this break out up to $460.  As you can see, that is a $25 difference.\n\nIn addition, it would have put us into a \xe2\x80\x9clong pole warning\xe2\x80\x9d were a reversal should drop at least halfway back down the column.  That would bring our reversal price objective to about $390.\n\nI am going to refer to these as the \xe2\x80\x9cshadow goals\xe2\x80\x9d just as a manner to differentiate on this chart.\n\nSo, here is my prediction:\n\nThe upside has some room to move, although it may exhaust itself because of the \xe2\x80\x9cshadow\xe2\x80\x9d movement.  \n\nIf I were a long, I would hold on until a reversal takes me out at  $405\xe2\x80\x99ish.  If I were to try to short\xe2\x80\x94I would enter that short with 1/\xe2\x80\x982 of my money at $408, and go full \xe2\x80\x9cHappy Jack\xe2\x80\x9d at $400 with a target of about $390 down to $385.\n\nIf you are not into the crazy stuff, stop reading here.\n\n[Chart of the Day](http://i.imgur.com/xChU1FT.png)\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94\n\nI am very concerned with the markets.  There seems to be a lot going on in the middle east that the US media is simply not covering.  I think Turkey is on its way to doing something stupid that is going to get them in trouble with Russia.  \n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t like the economic issues with the European banks.  Especially DB, and the banks in Italy.  Those could go bad with just a little edge.\n\nThe shit is about to hit the fan in Venezuela.  \n\nAs much as we do not think Bitcoin plays with the other kids on the block, the world is certainly interconnected.\n\nEducate yourselves on what is going on in other parts of the world.  Here is my fear:  If any one, or a combination of a couple of these things, happen there are derivative issues that could compound the impact on the markets.   There could be a very disorderly race to the door that the Central Banks could no longer control.\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cproblem\xe2\x80\x9d as I see it is that we could wake up any day and find a hot, very hot war in the middle east.  On an average day, that would not shock anyone.  But if it involves Russia and a NATO country, and if Russia hits targets in NATO there could be a perfect storm of shit. (The US would not be obligated to join in the fun, but we have forces on the ground in Turkey AND we support the Kurds--whom the Turks hate.)\n\nAnd 99% of the people in the US would not have a clue about what is going on and why all of a sudden the markets are tanking like most of us haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen.  It could impact the price of oil in a whipsaw, short squeeze of all time.\n\nAnd that would be the least of our problems.\n\nOr, John Kerry could pull  of a Nobel Peace Prize move in the Middle East and get thrown into the lead of the Dem. Presidential race.\n\nWhich of those two scenarios do you think is more likely?\n\nI conclusion\xe2\x80\xa6educate yourself.  And ask yourself, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat if\xe2\x80\xa6..?\xe2\x80\x9d  And when you\xe2\x80\x99ve thought through that question, for each of your answers ask it again.

Indicators: MACD Histogram, RSI, StochRSI]\n\nFrom a macro perspective, it seems like we were in a triangle - either between $420 and $370, or between $460 and $370 (roughly speaking). It seems we've broken out and hit the top of the smaller triangle, and if there was upwards momentum we would probably look at $460 (the top of the larger triangle) as the next medium-term upside target. \n\nFirst question: Have I drawn and identified those triangles correctly? Is that a fair analysis so far? \n\nNow, as to why this looks (to my very untrained eye) like a short situation is that there's MACD divergence on pretty much all the 4h charts (ie, we're making higher highs with lower momentum), are into overbought territory for the RSI and are heading there for the StockRSI. On the 1d charts, the StockRSI also looks like it could be doing a turnaround soon. \n\nThose technicals, combined with unspectacular volume and the uncertainty around the blockchain tech, makes any upwards movement look pretty flimsy to me - and in fact it looks like we might be close to a turnaround. \n\nSo, second question: Why are people so convinced that $420 is such an important milestone? And do we believe that there could be enough momentum in an upwards movement for us to start breaking up to the $450-460 range?

Which begs the question, then why not change to the different protocol?\n\nThat's what people have been vehemently fighting.  There are many who believe that changing the protocol right now is the wrong way to go.  Many don't like the idea of a handful of miners trying to impose their will on the market.  Accordingly, they may choose stick with protocol.  That group could, in fact, represent the economic majority.  Many in that group believe that such a move is a move toward centralization.  Maybe they want to support the chain that is not moving towards centralization.\n\nAll that would be required to continue to operate on the current chain is a one-time adjustment to difficulty so that blocks would solve in 10 minutes (or you could wait 8 weeks, assuming 25% of miners still were mining).\n\nHow do you think the market would respond to this type chaos?\n\nProbably poorly.\n\nMany people might think that the Segwit group would concede to prevent mutually assured destruction (of market value).

China will devalue the Renminbi which gives Bitcoin tailwind as Chinese use it to convert their money to USD. *CNY was already overvalued two years ago, before the USD\'s strong rise carried its peg 25% higher.

The block size halving is coming up which will change the supply side and further give Bitcoin tailwind.\n\n4.

I will try to explain it in a way that makes sense.\n\nThe last update I did was on Saturday. The movement during the end of the day Saturday (Coinbase/on Bitcoin Wisdom) the price had hit a high of $448.70. In that case this morning I would update the end of the day Saturday (2/20/16). That moves up to the $445-450 box.\n\nI did not do a chart yesterday. So I would look at the candlesticks and see that we did not exceed the high of the previous day. Therefore, I look at the low to see if there was a reversal during the day. The low of the current timeframe (19:00 UTC 2/21 to 18:59 UTC 2/22) has caused a potential reversal down to the $430.95 spot.\n\nWhat is important to note is that on the chart for \xe2\x80\x9cSaturday\xe2\x80\x9d the low went down to $426. But since the top reached into a new box, the low for the day is ignored.\n\nSince the day is not over, the reversal is not \xe2\x80\x9cofficial.\xe2\x80\x9d It will stand if we not not rise above $450 sometime during this day. As you can see the reversal today is shaded in grey. That will be \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d at 19:00 UTC, when the Bitcoinwisdom.com chart resets to a new day.\n\nSo, here is what this all means to me:\n\nWe reversed yesterday and that would re-set the long pole warning. The drop down the long pole should have been about 50% of the column, which would have put us in the $420-25 area. This pretty much happened on Saturday. It is simply that we do not account for it until Sunday.\n\nRight now it looks like it is stabilizing in the mid-$430s. It has been in this channel on the hourly chart for some time now.\n\nWhat do I predict? I can see us staying in the current channel for a day or so, confirming the column of Os. However, it is not going to take much from here to push up over the breakout point to go higher. A reversal to a column of Xs is only a few dollars away. And the move would take us back to another double top (which in PnF is good, not bad.)\n\nThe problem with PnF during periods of swings is that you can use them as a guide, but you need to understand how they work and see where the next move might be. For example, the long pole warned us of a pull back. It responded as it should have. It moved down quickly. If you were on top of that reversal you could have shorted safely down $10-15 and covered quickly and it never would have showed up on the chart.\n\nThe chart is the chart. It also proves that you can use this like a roadmap to set up trades, and then use day trading methods and skills to figure out exit strategies.\n\nChart of the Day\n\nResources\n\nDorsey-Wright, the best source of PnF Information\n\n*Investor Intelligence explanation of PnF Charts\n\n*Market Edge Explanation of PnF Charts\n\n*Stockcharts\n': 24, 'Downvote and report them, this is not the answer.': 3, '3d MACD histo is green..\n\nReference:\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2559nm/maybe_the_start_of_something/chdtyuk': 1, 'This is far from a serious analysis, but I downloaded a single block from today and ran it through Excel and this is what I got:\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/Mu4E2V5.png': 10, "Actually, you have it precisely backwards.

Won\'t make a huge difference if you just scalp away from time to time, but I think it\'s worth mentioning.\n\nAlso, apart from how liquidations are done and the like, one noticeable difference is the index price calculation, and especially how closely price follows different markets.

You see, the fact is there is also positive energy around Bitcoin. It is my hypothesis that these "energies" are stored causality. Causality is best known as the main actor in Einstein\'s equations. Causality is what gives a limit to the speed of light (in a weird way).\n\nWhile I\'m certainly not going to expect anyone here to believe this one way or the other, I think that causality in our universe is somehow related to life. This is why some people say that E=mc^2 is a philosophical argument.\n\nOne hypothesis I\'m kicking around is the idea that double bind arguments (which require life to propagate) give way to cognitive dissonance inside people (who are again alive). A good example of dissonance is saying things like Bitcoin "may tumble" because of negative energy, but then experience a "halving rally" because assumably the halving will drive things higher. This statement is essentially a zero net gain sentiment post, which means you are basically saying "I\'m negative on Bitcoin" without a justification. By itself, this could be considered a form of a double bind argument.\n\nCognitive dissonance causes people to make double bind arguments, so the going assumption is that you are in cognitive dissonance. And, moreover, for each negative person like you in dissonance, there exists an equally positive person in dissonance for whatever reasons they believe Bitcoin will succeed.\n\nAnd by that argument, Bitcoin is undergoing massive cognitive dissonance right now.

You can make smaller blocks by ignoring certain transactions, which is what is already happening. But for bitcoin to work, pretty much all valid transactions must be placed into blocks. In other words, block size will ebb and flow with the number of people sending and receiving transactions, and NOT based on how many miners/the hash rate, etc.\n\nThe future is uncertain regarding mining, but as long as bitcoin continues to grow its user base, block size needs will only continue to increase.

The range of the column we are in is wide.  There is no reason to act as long at the price remains in the column.\n2.
