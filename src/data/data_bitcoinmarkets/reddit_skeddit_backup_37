In theory it could be easy to test with a calculator, but in reality when you have dozens of loans some of which are being canceled and then auto-reissued ...\n\nWhen someone buys/sells on margin, that is done in their margin account with separate funds.  To transfer out BTC/LTC, one first needs to close the position, which of course repays any loans outstanding.\n\nI've been lending/swapping for months mainly without insurance and i have never noticed any significant loss.  The insurance is rarely available anyway and I dont really understand why.\n\nHowever, I do believe that I have been somewhat lucky in missing flash crashes.  If i remember correctly there was a severe one back in December.\n\nFlash crashes  are a risk, but probably minor compared to the major risk which simply is that bitfinex itself absconds with the funds, or is hacked, or is running a fractional reserve and goes belly up.\n\nI believe the interest rates mainly reflect trust in bitfinex as an entity relative to the immediate return available in bitcoin (lending vs margin trading).\n\n>Also kind of unrelated, but couldn't I just take a really low interest swap for 30 days, and place an offer for a higher swap\n\nI dont think so, but only because they split the funds into 3 separate accounts.

If you earn less than 10 USD per day, you'll have to wait and if you only do manual offers, you'll have to earn 100 USD/day.\n\nCurrently that would require you to maintain around 10k and 100k USD lent out most of the time.\n\nAlso there is a 10% fee by Bitfinex, so you get 0.09% in interest on a loan for 0.1%.": 1, 'Well first of all, you only get the interest rate when someone is actually borrowing your money. So if your funds are "available" for lending, but no one uses it for margin trading, it will just be sitting there.\n\nOnce someone lends your money, I believe it is simple interest, as the interest you are gaining is not being re-lended, it goes straight to your wallet.\n\nEDIT: You have to factor 2 main risks. Flash crash fucking you over and Bitfinex fucking you over. Over the span of 1 year, what would be your interest gained if you had you money lended out for 365 days? Let\'s say for simplicity you use 0.1%, so in one year you would gain 36.5% yield.\n\nWhat is your prediction for BitFinex closing shop and taking everyone\'s money? Let\'s say 2% chance of that happening in the next year.\n\nAnd let\'s say there\'s a 5% chance of a flash crash where the lender cannot pay you back.\n\nSo in this scenario you would have 93% to gain 36.5% profit, but 7% chance to lose everything.\n\nI was tempted to just stick my cold storage coins for long term interest, but decided against it.

I represented one of the six wallets that contained that LTC.

I planned on holding every single one of my LTC for the purpose of spending it, and never cashing it back in for fiat. My plans changed 6 weeks ago. I have had my house up for sale for 16 months. On January 22nd I found a buyer for the house, and their financing started. The bank approved them for the loan, and we were on our way. Closing day of February 28th was set.\nJanuary 27th, I had put an offer in on my dream home. After negotiations, I put down a $450,000 deposit for the house to hold it until March 31st where I would be paying the remaining balance with the proceeds from my house sale, and I would also be taking a loan out. My loan was approved, I had paid the deposit, and I was simply waiting on the closing on the sale of my house to move forward.\nI had a huge amount of pods at my house, had movers there for two weeks, rented numerous storage units to move all of my stuff to while we planned on having some remodeling done to the house we were buying, and then it happened, the buyers of my house were pinched for forged documents and the loan was cancelled, they bailed. I had a deposit, hindsight, I should have made it a bigger number, but I made a huge mistake, as their deposit didn\'t come close to offsetting my 450k deposit I had to put down. I had to come up with a huge lump of money, or I would be losing my deposit on the house I put down. I tried many lenders, and could not increase the size of my loan to cover the difference in the time frame necessary on my end.\nSo now I\'m trapped. Legal proceedings would have taken months (if I was lucky) to get reimbursement for all of my expenses. They broke their buyers contract, which I have since found out doesn\'t mean shit where I live, and I was in panic mode. While I believe in crypto currency to the fullest extent, I had to choose between liquidating my conventional investments, including many that I can\'t touch without paying huge penalties (roth, 401, etc) or liquidate my pile of LTC/BTC. The problem with LTC, was that a sale of that much would probably damage the market (short term), so as I was looking for a private buyer for my holdings, I ran into a group of 5 others who were trying to shop their wallets for a private buyer. We were even offering to sell the whole stash at a 15% below market price at that time, because we feared if we all unloaded at the same time on btc-e, it would crash the price of LTC..\nWhile we had interest from three different parties, nobody could meet our time frame.

For every rapid succession of block discoveries, at some point there will probably be a long period of no discoveries.

They\'re looking for a resulting hash that begins with a certain number of 0 bits, depending on the current difficulty level.\n\nSo, it\'s the same thing as rolling a <difficulty> number of 2-sided dice (if such a thing existed), and you keep re-rolling until they all come up 0.\n\nBut because the outcome of a roll is constant for a given input (which is the header that contains the incremented value), it\'s easy for anyone else to check your work and see that the hash does begin with that many zeros.

Everything in an ecosystem is interconnected, so there has to be some effect.  The question is--how do you *minimize* such an effect?\n\nThe answer is "keep it a free market".  In a free market, systemic risk is minimal.  Gox went down, but there was no systemic risk to other exchanges like there was when Lehman went down.  Bitstamp, BTC-E, and the Chinese exchanges kept chugging along.  The badness of the ecosystem was scooped out and everything else was left intact.\n\nThe alternative--regulation--is what introduces systemic risk into the ecosystem.  Instead of a diverse ecosystem constantly evolving different practices and methods, regulation standardizes procedures.  This may appear to be a good thing superficially, but the evaluation of what makes a *good* procedure or practice or standard is something to be discovered by trial-and-error, not by central planning.

FB -1.37%  chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nSecondMarket, which launched the Bitcoin Investment Trust last September to cater to wealthy investors, has started lining up lawyers and investment banks to help with the process.\n\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust buys and sells bitcoins, allowing investors to place bets on the digital currency without owning it directly. It held $54 million in assets under management as of Tuesday, according to its website.\n\nThe trust would compete with the Winklevoss Investment Trust, an effort sponsored by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who won a $65 million settlement with Facebook\'s Mr. Zuckerberg in 2008 over their claim that he stole their idea for the social-networking site.\n\nThe Winklevoss brothers have applied to create an exchange-traded fund specializing in bitcoin.\n\nSecondMarket, primarily a marketplace to trade shares of nonpublic companies, is taking a different route. It wants to take its existing fund, which is geared toward investors with more than $1 million in assets and annual incomes above $200,000, and make it available to ordinary people. It plans to list the fund on OTC OTCM +0.61% Markets, an electronic exchange.\n\nSecondMarket is seeking approval from OTC Markets and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, a self-regulatory body, to market the trust to investors. The New York firm is lining up investment banks that would act as market-makers, or make commitments to buy or sell shares in the fund, and is screening law firms to act as a securities expert.\n\nIf OTC Markets and Finra approve the plan, the fund\'s shares could become publicly available as soon as the fourth quarter to investors with less than $1 million in assets and annual incomes below $200,000.\n\nSecondMarket\'s move comes as other firms ramp up efforts to build a more robust investment infrastructure for bitcoin and other digital currencies.\n\nOn Tuesday, Pantera Capital said it had joined forces with fellow hedge fund Fortress Investment Group FIG -0.75%  and two venture-capital firms to form a fund solely dedicated to bitcoin investments. Other initiatives, including one led by telecommunications provider Perseus Telecom and a separate venture by SecondMarket, aim to develop fully regulated, high-tech bitcoin exchanges for professional investors.\n\nThe Winklevoss fund applied in July for approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission to be classified as an exchange-traded fund, a lengthy process.\n\nEvan Greebel, a lawyer at Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP\'s New York office who is handling the Winklevoss application, said it is "going smoothly and we don\'t anticipate any problems." Citing SEC rules, he said he couldn\'t estimate a timetable for completion of the approval process.\n\nBy circumventing the SEC approval process, SecondMarket expects to be the first firm to bring a regulated bitcoin fund to the general public.\n\nUntil now, ordinary investors have been able to invest directly in the digital currency only via one of many loosely regulated online exchanges. But that strategy carries risks, as highlighted by last month\'s collapse of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, which said in a bankruptcy filing that 850,000 bitcoins had vanished from its coffers.\n\nThe Bitcoin Investment Trust pitches itself as a safer vehicle, with its obligations to investors denominated in dollars, not bitcoin, and with regulatory oversight giving investors a greater deal of confidence.\n\nIt is unclear how deep such demand for bitcoin runs among the general public. In December, The Wall Street Journal reported that mainstream financial advisers were recommending that their clients steer clear of the highly volatile digital currency.\n\nIn keeping with the volatile moves in the price of bitcoin versus the dollar, the SecondMarket trust has seen big swings in value. Since it started trading in September, it is up 371% but is down 20% this year.\n\nOTC Markets is an electronic successor to the decades-old Over The Counter Bulletin Board, also called the "pink sheets," an unregulated market for stocks that don\'t meet the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq NDAQ -2.60% Stock Market. SecondMarket\'s fund is applying to list on a part of OTC Markets known as OTCQX, which has more rigorous financial disclosure requirements and includes big-name foreign companies such as Canada\'s Bombadier Inc. and Japan\'s Yamaha Corp. 7951.TO +0.15%\n\nTyler Winklevoss argues that his fund, which would trade on a fully regulated exchange, is a safer option. "Because the [SEC] hurdles we are going to have to jump are higher and because it\'s a more rigorous process, the idea is that it is going to be more viable and open to mainstream investors," he said.\n': 8, '...wat': 2, '> It plans to list the fund on OTC OTCM +0.61% Markets, an electronic exchange.\n\n\nDo you know if this OTC stock they are referring to: http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=OTCM+&ql=1': 1, 'Insider trading is legal outside of stocks.': 0, "If you mean SecondMarket's bitcoin stock, then no.

They offer up different options, though; charging people negative fees tends to create weird structures. Traditional maker-taker allows someone to profit without selling the asset for a higher price. I dislike that because it causes price stability (and IMO too much of it). We want stable prices, we don\'t want immobile prices. I think the traditional maker-taker system creates price immobility, not price stability.\n\nAlso, you\'ll note I said that I DO want a maker-taker system like that. It would be lower risk profit for me. However, I\'m not sure it\'s good for the average user of Bitfinex. You may counter and say that these market makers are more important to Bitfinex, but they both are and aren\'t. If their only customers are market makers, they will all leave--there\'s no one taking from them. As a result, Bitfinex has to balance their system. If the system favors makers too heavily, it disincentivizes smaller-time traders, and the makers, the "sharks", leave because there are no more fish for them. If it favors takers too heavily, the sharks swim for easier prey, and Bitfinex doesn\'t have high enough volume/liquidity.\n\nI\'m of the opinion that this new system is a good mix.

But my MAIN point here is to add one more big piece to your picture -- you also need to think like a bigger trader, not necessarily an institutional level trader (I was recently asked at our local meetup group by a hedge fund manger how to buy $1million+ worth of BTC on an exchange). Those kind of players need the thick order book that a standard maker/taker model offers, they also bring the volume that an exchange likes to see & is generally most interested in.\n\nAlso I don\'t really agree with your point that if all customers are market markets "they will all leave" -- this is a very over simplistic generalization of your belief of what happens in markets but if you have traded listed stocks for the last 10 years you will see that is largely not the case.

I hold the Bitcoin community to a higher standard because they fight through a lot of the consistent FUD of MSM. What I would suggest is to stop reciting MSM talking points on HFT and Wall Street derived models just the same.\n\nLet me provide an example: Lets say a "commoner" wants to buy a house and wants to lock in their mortgage rate at 3.75%  -- what the bank does behind the scenes is go out in the Treasury market or OTC and locks in their spread at the same time for the amount of the property (say $300k). This way the banks aren\'t subject to moves in underlying interest rates and it provides comfort to the borrower that they can proceed through the multiple month closing processes with a fixed interest rate. Without the liquidity in these markets borrowers would be at the mercy of the market during that period of time -- and it could well determine if they can or can not afford that monthly payment. This is an instance of both the need to have thick markets & for the banks to hedge using a derivative product.\n\nAnother argument I have heard is that HFTs are just evil and this guy was going to be telling me "I told you so" when they snip my stop-loss orders. First off I don\'t suggest stop-loss orders to begin with especially in Bitcoin and cryptos -- but in addition non-HFT instruments are just as subject to these kind of things only from a different attack vector.

A $5.7 swing in price on the 12.5M coins currently in existence is a LOT more than $19k - it is actually about $71M extra in "market cap". Yes, this is cheating a bit since Bitstamp is not the entire market.

I'm not overly concerned about it and trust Blockchain.\n\nMy favorite feature is the [visual depth table](http://i.imgur.com/weMGcfU.jpg) especially for seeing walls being put up and taken down quickly. It's crazy when the market is volatile. It's also cool because you get to see where your orders sit and can quickly spot if someone leapfrogs in front of you. Next time there's a lot of volatility, I'm going to make a video of it. \n\nI also really like that you can turn on audible alerts for trades or liquidity changes over a certain threshold.\n\nIt doesn't lag like wisdom and doesn't go down when  wisdom does either. Those audible alerts go off several seconds before you see the trade on wisdom.\n\nWhat I don't like is on one occasion when I placed a limit buy order that turned into a market buy. They say that that bug would be fixed when it became zero block but I don't quite trust it yet.\n\nI also don't like that the [visual depth table does not always match the orderbook](http://imgur.com/5vmC7Do) so it can't be trusted.

I agree with everything he's said (though wasn't aware of those issues).\n\nThe one thing I'll add is that I'm able to place orders faster with RTBTC, which is obviously a pro. With stamp's site it always takes a few seconds to show up in the order book. With RTBTC the instant execution, customization and ability to see everything you want on the same page are great features. I much prefer it over stamp's UI.": 2, 'I have been using RTBTC/ZeroBlock since December.  It is very customizeable and I have my own overlays and indicators setup.  I also like the news module that highlights news in near real time - shows up in bright yellow and seems to be quicker than some of the news aggregators I have tried.  The Visual Depth module is pretty awesome and you can actually increase and decrease the size to see where all the orders are.  One of the few places you can actually "see" the entire order book.\n\nWhen you place orders, it places indicators on the Visual Depth module and lines on the charts so you can see exactly where your bids and asks are in relation to all the trading activity.\n\nI keep one buy module ready and one sell module ready for quick entries - works very well.  If you are trading your full fiat balance or full BTC balance, you click on either balance and the balance will be entered in the amount field of the Order Entry Modules (Fiat balance goes to Buy Order Entry Module and BTC balance goes to Sell Order Entry Module).\n\nSupport is pretty awesome.  They have fixed several of the issues I have found.\n\nThe biggest issue is mentioned in the above post and I have reported it to support as well.  Some people think it is not in sync, but it actually is in better sync than any other site that I have seen.  That is because RTBTC has a real-time stream of the order book.  What others see as not being in sync is actually because the other sites just retrieve the order book in blocks of time so I think the other sites are actually the ones that are not in sync with Bitstamp.\n\nThe real problem with the Order Book is the Order Book and Visual Depth modules do not show the top bid or ask if it is being picked.  For example, when the 10k limit sell was active last week, whenever transactions were executing against that order it did not show up.  When that started, I actually was thinking the whale was dropping the wall periodically but that was not the case - it is a problem with the RTBTC platform.  You can see the sales in the Time and Sales Module but you can\'t see where they are coming from.  Pretty major issue for me so I have to keep a BitcoinWisdom chart active all the time so I can see that activity.  Think about it.  When a huge limit sell is being executed and you can\'t see that someone has a 10K ask order being eaten through and still has 7k to go, it can definitely affect how you decide to react.\n\nI have a 100 Meg connection and am pretty particular about performance and response time.  Not that it matters any more, but they did have some problems with MtGox when MtGox changed to PubNub but when I complained about it (and probably others), they switched back to websockets.  I have had no problems with Bitstamp and have not noticed any lag.\n\nThe price was right at $12 per month and probably worth the $20 per month given that they will likely add more exchanges in the future.  If they fix the Order Book issue, I will be 100% pleased.\n\nKeep in mind it is a platform that is running code on your computer.  If you are moving the charts around or just flying your cursor around to see pricing, it uses a lot of cpu.

Because withdrawing larger amounts cash from banks in China if you're a foreigner means you must provide documentation...etc its just a pain in the ass. And for very large amounts you probably can't do it without a lot of difficulties.\n\nAs an aside, I will also use it to send money to my home country bank account.

If anything, huge mining pools stabilize the value of dogecoins, increasing their usage because of the stability.  I don't see what the problem is.\n\nSecond, assuming there is a problem, I don't understand how it can be solved.  The only thing dogecoin can do to avoid pools like mine from mining it is to go down in value.  As long as dogecoins are valuable, then pools will start mining them.\n\nFinally, the Middlecoin pool has been pounding away at DOGE and other coins for months, making millions of dollars in profits.  They crashed DOGE themselves in late December.  This problem is nothing new, so I don't know why it's gaining attention now.\n\nThe time is coming when altcoins will need to have their own unique proof of work algorithms in order to remain viable, like quark.  The problem with that is that nobody will have the equipment to mine those coins, and their newly formed algorithms will likely be insecure, so many of those coins will be killed by 51% attacks and security vulnerabilities.
