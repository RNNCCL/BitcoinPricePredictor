This trader uses your money for leveraged speculation. Should Bitcoins fall in value, he gets the "margin call" and his Bitcoins are automatically sold in order to repay the loan. However, those margin calls can trigger a chain reaction, pushing the price lower very quickly and leading to a flash crash. In such a scenario, the sold Bitcoins would not suffice to repay the loan and the creditor (you) would suffer a loss.': -1, 'It does not look like it, really :)\n\nWe have the right persons on board and a profitable business plan, all is set to let you enjoy some good returns\n\nRaphael': 1, 'I wish I knew. That question seems just as hard to answer as "what is a reasonable estimate for BTC price in 12 months". Some history may assist though http://www.bfxdata.com': 3, "Another risk to consider is regulation.  I'm feeling pretty good about this as I haven't seen a single argument that has found Bitfinex to be in violation of any regulation.   Apparently Hong Kong does not have restrictions on swap lending.  However, it is possible that the SEC (or another entity) could have rules on this matter (and all US citizens would be subject to them regardless of where Bitfinex was located).\n\n\nLast year there was the possible risk that Bitfinex would lose connection to an exchange and thus have to rely upon its internal order book for pricing.  This has been fixed as the internal order book is much stronger and external connections have been dropped.\n\nThere is still a problem that Bitfinex could have a server outage (hardware issue, badly scheduled maintenance, or hackers) during a flash crash. If so, Bitfinex could go bankrupt.  On the plus side, I think flash crashes will become less frequent and less severe as the market matures and governments establish their regulatory positions.\n": 0, 'I think the rates are on a long term downward trend to 20% APR (or 0.05%/day).  But then we get hit by shocks  and they go much higher.  I think only a massive bull market can sustain rates of 0.2%/day for longer than a week.  0.1-0.15% is easier to sustain but also requires at least a mildly bullish market.\n\n\n\nYou can look at the BTC rate to see how far it can fall.  People are lending out BTC for 0.0055%/day (2% APR).  ': 2, 'Great advice! Thank you!': 1, "I thought about this recently too, and at first thought it would be an attractive way to earn money from the bitcoin ecosystem while hedging risk in the value of the asset.\n\nHowever, demand for loans is still correlated with demand for the underlying asset (obviously). if you want to put up a couple thousand dollars, you may as well put up a couple hundred in BTC. Lending in finex contains most of the risk and none of the reward of BTC. It's like a shitty bond.": 2, 'There are two very different market measures of risk.  The BTC swap rate is currently 2% APR - which presumes a very low rate of failure.  The USD swap rate has not fallen much below 20% APR - which points to a much higher risk of failure.': 1, 'This. Commonly called, getting goxed.': 12, "> So your only risk is the counterparty risk, ie bitfinex going bankrupt.\n\nThank you for your input, Raphael. Please don't go bankrupt, ok?": 3, "> I give you withdrawals fees for wires are high, so please check them out to know what to expect.\n\nWhat does this mean? That the withdrawal fee is expensive? It's only 0.1%, that's pretty reasonable": 1, "The biggest risk is counterparty. Bitfinex pulls up shop, or becomes insolvent or whatnot and you're out of luck. \n\nFor example, conspiracy theory. Say that BFX is hypothetically double dipping be lending money themselves. But being the exchange, they can loan money they don't actually have (or rather, they can loan their user deposits). Note this wouldn't contradict their earlier audit since the money is still under their control. In this no-evidence, FUD scenario, a flash crash could wipe out the exchange and all its lenders.\n\nThe smaller risk is that while the rates are high, they are not nearly as high as they appear because lenders can close or refinance loans at any time (nor will you be loaned out 100% of the time if you're chasing the higher rates). Ridiculous peak rates last hours or a couple days at most. And dont forget BFX takes 15% of your profit too.\n\nAnd the final risk is opportunity cost. Its obvious, but your money is tied up for the length of the loan. This is why I only loan for shorter periods, for example--I want to be able to pull out if the exchange starts to look dodgy or another good opportunity comes up.": 20, "I've written a similar post a short while ago. I think it fits here:\n\n>You should really look at the longterm graph though. 0.4 % is far, far above the average at the moment. Today it's already below 0.4 % (0.34-0.36). In the past months the rates were mostly below 0.1 %. Sometimes they will spike to insane highs (up to 1 %) although these are often quickly returned. You also have to invest quite some time and continously check the rates and whether offers were prematurely returned. Lending out autmatically with flash return rate will lead to terrible sub par rates so you really have to invest some time putting offers back up etc.\n\n>The loans sound attractive but be aware that if you make 10 % gains and bfx runs away with your money this isn't worth it. Also cashing out from BFX is not that easy as they use international wire transfer and take 0.1 % 0.2 % fee + 20 $ (Something which was not the case at the beginning but was suddenly announced without any time to pull out your money before). And mind you they have changed their bank three times in the last 6 months. I'd be very careful.\n\n>If you want to stay within the law you also have to consider that on top of the amount BFX takes (0.15 % of your interest) you have to pay capital gains on top.\n\n>EDIT: It will signifcantly depend on the market whether you'll be making bank with lending or will regret putting your money on the other side of the world. If we have a strong bull market for the rest of the year and there is actually going to be a bubble you can potentially expect very strong returns although investing in btc in that kind of situation would have been infinitely more profitable. If we just bop up and down for the rest of the year or enter another bear market you will kick yourself for having to watch your money there constantly and see the swap rate sink to 0.05 % a day or something. Another aspect to consider: BFX has become a whole lot more popular which means more and more people see the (apparently) attractive p2p lending (compared to the joke interest rates you get from banks) and put their money there to loan it out. This will eventually suppress the lending rate (if the demand doesn't increase at the same rate) and also makes it more and more attractive for bfx to close their doors and run for the hills.\n": 3, "The main thing to be aware of is that the loan can be repaid at any time with no penalty. If the rates drop, it's most likely your swap will be closed, and you will need to follow the market down with a lower rate.\n\nTldr don't do your calculations under the assumption that 0.4 percent is any kind of sustainable rate. The rate is a product of how many people expect a short term price rise which seems to be a very popular expectation right now. Unless you know something everyone else doesn't, perhaps it's best to stay in BTC.": 3, "Hello,\n\nSo as some users noticed the FAQ was not clear, and we updated it, to reflect the fact that we now fully insure your swaps, after some changes we made to the trading engine to avoid as much as possible liquidation happening at a loss for lenders and setting sensible maximum leverage. As a matter of fact the last months of crashes we did not lose a cent.\nSo your only risk is the counterparty risk, ie bitfinex going bankrupt.\n\nRegarding some remarks in this thread I need to say: bitfinex does not lend money itself, be it user money or non existent money. Trading and swap fees provides a...certain source of revenue that would make taking risks like this rather stupid, wouldn't it?\n\nI give you withdrawals fees for wires are high, so please check them out to know what to expect.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions\n\nRaphael": 10, 'What /u/jonhuang said really covers it. As he said, borrowers can close out the loan. I have roughly $10k open on margin right now, so I am checking and closing loans 4-5 times a day.

Each re-lend also comes with a period of your funds being sat idle, so it's best to minimise those.\n\nAlso best to split your funds up into smaller batches so you don't have to scramble to re-lend *everything* all at once, and can be more chill about waiting for a better rate because it's only a small chunk of your balance that's temporarily not earning.\n\nIdeally you want a long duration at a rate that you won't regret offering, but obviously we don't know where the rates are going to be in the future... so I would generally just scale how long a duration I'm willing to offer to match how high the rate is - high rates at 30days, low rates set so their end-dates are spread out over the next few days to a week.": 1, "You should really look at the longterm graph though. 0.4 % is far, far above the average at the moment. Today it's already below 0.4 % (0.34-0.36). In the past months the rates were mostly below 0.1 %. Sometimes they will spike to insane highs (up to 1 %) although these are often quickly returned. You also have to invest quite some time and continously check the rates and whether offers were prematurely returned. Lending out autmatically with flash return rate will lead to terrible sub par rates so you really have to invest some time putting offers back up etc. \n\nThe loans sound attractive but be aware that if you make 10 % gains and bfx runs away with your money this isn't worth it. Also cashing out from BFX is not that easy as they use international wire transfer and take 0.1 % ~~0.2 % fee + 20 $~~ (Something which was not the case at the beginning but was suddenly announced without any time to pull out your money before).

Thirdly, the state owns one of the largest credit card processing businesses in the world (China UnionPay), they smacked down AliPay so it\'s very predictable to smack down Bitcoin from a payments POV. Next, they have a history of smacking down "virtual money", QQ Coin was much larger than Bitcoin is today (based on users) and they killed it, turned it into LindenDollars.

Note that I am by no means an expert on China and can only speak as a layperson who has lived in China and is generally interested in Chinese society and politics:\n\nBefore saying anything else, let me just say this: the Chinese government and the CCP are very opaque in their operation and there is a whole cottage industry based around trying to get inside the head of the party. Opinions on how the party thinks are a dime a dozen and should always be taken with a healthy dose of NaCl.\n\nThat said, my opinion has been and will continue to be that the Chinese government is likely currently very conflicted when it comes to bitcoin. On the one hand, bitcoin is an obvious threat to the Chinese government's monetary controls, which are significantly more restrictive than the West. In the U.S. we complain about manipulation of the monetary supply and by extension the markets and the economy as a whole by the Federal Reserve, but in China things are significantly worse in this respect. Not only does the government set interest rates and meddle in the economy using liquidity injection that makes the U.S. Fed's QE look like child's play, they also control the yuan to dollar exchange rate which they also use to enforce policy and, of course, enrich themselves. Mass adoption of bitcoin in China would take this formidable power away from the government.\n\nHowever, the Chinese are a pragmatic people and the CCP has proven that it can be very pragmatic when it needs to be. I think that this article shows that at least a few people in power must be aware that bitcoin and cryptos in general are not going away any time soon and the technology is potentially a great engine of prosperity for China and her people. Just like China switched to a more market oriented economy during Deng Xiaoping's tenure because they knew they could either take the bitter pill of free markets and live to fight another day or die, I'm sure some people in government realize that trying to pretend bitcoin does not exist is not an option, lest they once again get economically eclipsed by the West.\n\nMore specifically, this article suggests that, surprisingly, bitcoin is not a dirty word within higher level government and policy circles, which is good news for bitcoin's future in China. My attitude toward the Chinese bitcoin situation remains one of cautious optimism and for the sake of the Chinese people I hope bitcoin continues to at least be tolerated if not officially accepted by the government. If history is any indicator, the government will still try and control bitcoin even if it accepts it's existence, but exactly how they might try and control that which by design cannot be controlled is anybody's guess.": 20, "We played this game before, multiple times.\n\nHere's my translation for you:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boy_Who_Cried_Wolf\n": 6, "This thread has been linked to from elsewhere on reddit.\n\n\n - [/r/Bitcoin] [Chinese Central Bank Official: There is Significant Space for Bitcoin to Exist (Great post from r/bitcoinmarkets)](http://np.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/28s56l/chinese_central_bank_official_there_is/)\n\n\n*^If ^you ^follow ^any ^of ^the ^above ^links, ^respect ^the ^rules ^of ^reddit ^and ^don't ^vote ^or ^comment. ^Questions? ^Abuse?

": 9, 'Most of the people selling on Localbitcoins do it for clean profit. For example, if the seller is in Italy and BTC price on Bitstamp is $600, they would send fiat to Bitstamp. Their selling price on Localbitcoins would be 625-700, or the equivalent in Euros taking into account the cost to exchange EUR/USD, dependind on how much volume they do and what methods they use to get the buyers money. Once a buyer wants BTC, the seller just buys on Bitstamp for ~600 and send it to the buyer who pays 625-700 after getting their money. They probably have their own bitcoins that they buy and hold or trade with. Maybe they also buy BTC too, but at a better rate, slightly below the rate on exchanges. Again this is clean profit, buy 10 BTC at $580 from a seller who wants privacy, cash out gambling earnings, drug earnings...etc and sell immediately on Bitstamp for ~600.\n\nSo your theory about "whales" manipulating the Localbitcoins market and exchanges for the purpose of acquiring more bitcoins is not a good one. Also the buy line, for bids on Localbitcoins, is fairly irrelevant. No seller is going to sell their BTC for a price below the market rate unless they\'re dumb or cashing out illegal earnings, so very few bid orders are getting filled. I won\'t bother looking for it and I\'m not sure if the data can be found, but I\'m betting that bids getting filled off of Localbitcoins make up less than 5-10% of the total volume.\n\nI think that the bid price has leveled off more closely to the exchange price because more people are now aware of how to buy and sell via exchanges. So the only or significant majority of people selling their BTC at the Localbitcoins bid price are people evading taxes, drug dealers, people who really care about privacy. And these are probably larger $$$ value deals, since the person buying probably just sells immediately for fiat, so they must make at least $50-100 to cover the wire transfer fees, time, gas if meeting face to face...etc and make some profit\n\nEdit: Look at the chart again, the Sell and 24AVG line are almost identical, and are only different at one point in 7 day chart.

I\'d like to post some of the charts that I have created over the last few weeks, and I have slightly changed my... bias of what cycle Bitcoin has undergone and will undergo in the future.\n\nUntil recently, I have thought that Bitcoin has undergone One major wave, one minor wave, and two "normal" waves in it\'s lifecycle. I have been enlightened to the fact that this may not be the only possibility. It\'s also plausible that each time we achieve an ATH, we see many key features in the price action in the months leading up to and from the peak. I have created 3 different charts that I have tried to explain this and when combined when the rest of my charting history, I hope you can begin to understand the style of how I am using historical analysis to predict the future macro movements. \n\n[Corrections that Bounce Off of Bear Traps](http://i.imgur.com/fLCtCKj.png)\n\n[Multi-wave Bubble Cycle](http://i.imgur.com/Tv0FSrM.png)\n\n["Elliot Waves" During Bubbles](http://i.imgur.com/sqzPusQ.png)\n\nIn addition, here are the live versions of previous charts that I have made:\n\n[The Famous Triple Comparison](http://i.imgur.com/EG1olcD.png)\n\n[ Percentage Comparison of Bubble Recoveries](http://i.imgur.com/NDmIfel.png)\n\n[LTC is Primed and Ready](http://i.imgur.com/MZ7knZI.png)\n\nThis last LTC chart also shows that we are on the verge of a Bitcoin bubble.

Bids will not be accepted, however, from any person or entity that appear on the U.S. \nTreasury Department\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Foreign Assets Control list of \xe2\x80\x9cSpecially Designated Nationals.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAll deposit and purchase funds must be received from a US bank. No exceptions.\n\n2. **Can I form a syndicate of buyers?**\nThe person or entity that registers to bid on this auction must satisfy all registration \nrequirements, including certifying that the bidder is not acting in concert with the defendant or \ndefendant entity. This certification extends and applies to all members of a syndicate. The \nprimary bidder should perform whatever due diligence the bidder feels is necessary in order to \ncomfortably make that certification. \n\n3. **How do I make a bid?**\nRegistered bidders only will receive a bid form upon close of the registration period.\n\n4. **How much money do I need to make a bid?**\nPlease see Section 1.C of the Bidder Registration Form. The funds available in the account \nprovided to the United States Marshals Service must be sufficient to cover your anticipated bid \nprice. Do not assume that a subsequent transfer of funds into such account will suffice for this \nrequirement.\n\n5. **Can I make multiple bids?**\nA bid form allows you to bid on multiple blocks for the same price. For example, you may place \na bid for $X per bitcoin for 5 blocks from Series A. The total bid price in this example would be \n$X * 3,000 bitcoins * 5 blocks. This counts as one bid.\nA single bid form does not allow you to submit multiple bids at varying prices. For example, you \nmay not submit one bid for $X for 1 block from Series A, and $Y for 1 block from Series A. If you \nwish to submit multiple bids at varying prices, you will need to submit multiple bid forms. For \neach bid form, you must submit a $200,000 deposit. In addition, you must show funds available \nto cover the aggregate amount of all anticipated bids.\n\n6. **Is there a reserve price for this auction?**\nThe United States Marshals Service reserves the right to sell some, all or none of the bitcoins for \nany reason. There is no disclosed reserve price for this auction.\n\n7. **How does the auction process work?**\nThis is a sealed bid auction. You will not have the opportunity to view other bids. You will not \nhave the opportunity to change your bid once submitted. \n\n8. **How and when will I receive the bitcoins if I am the winning bidder?**\nThe bitcoin transfer process will begin immediately following receipt of purchase funds. Specific \ndetails regarding the transfer will be communicated to the winning bidder(s).\n\n9. **When and how will my deposit be returned to me?**\nWe will begin processing return of deposits immediately following the close of the bitcoin \ntransaction(s). We hope to process all returns within ten (10) business days, but high \nparticipation may result in slightly longer return times.\nAll deposits will be returned by federal wire transfer to the same account from which the funds \nwere originally received.

A 1% arbitrage opportunity carries a hell of a lot more risk than a 10%.  If the only bidders involved are seeking arbitrage then the gap will not "close to zero" .  The gap will close to the point at which risk tolerance meets the possible reward. Granted this will likely be < 5% but still it will not be zero or close too it.  Just because I buy at 1% below market does not mean I can sell all my purchase at market price when even one 3k block represents a significant portion of daily volume.  If your response to that is "well sell your coins over a weeks time", sure you can do that but then you are incurring more risk because a weeks worth of movement could easily put the market price down 1%. \n\nScenario two and beyond basically says "anyone who actually wants the coins will buy them at or above market rate".  Well of course, that makes complete sense but the question remains **is there anyone who wants these coins and not the arbitrage opportunity?**  I optimistically believe this to be the case however there is far from a guarantee that it is.  Basically there are two types of buyers that could come to this auction, those who want arbitrage and those who want coins.  The arbitrage crowd will come and they will bid under market.  Let\'s just hope the other crowd comes too.': 12, "Stop talking about market orders as the only viable alternative, much more viable to buy smaller amounts over a longer period of time, the mere thought of such a market order is ridiculous.\n\nThe calculation is fully correct but you don't understand it.

If you don't win you get the $200k back but otherwise it is a down payment.": 4, "I too have been waiting for someone smarter than me to rationally think this through.\n\nMy first tip goes to you sir, that's if I do it right!\n\n$5 /u/changetip": 5, 'It could also be $400 or less but that is a little beside the point.

If you're *reasonably* well connected it's not hard to find them. For example although it's not been disclosed anywhere public that I know of, Jawed Karim of Youtube fame and that ex-FB founder guy Eduardo Saverin both own a lot of coins.\n\nIf you're a rich person or organization looking for coins, it's not hard to find this out. Hell, I'm not rich and I'm not looking for a lot of coins and I know this. If it was my job I'm sure I'd have 10x the info here. And I'd just go hit all of them up and see what price they'd sell me some coins at.\n\nThat being said, since both those particular guys are obscenely rich, I doubt they'd bother selling until it's worth an insane amount, because they don't care if they lose $100M. It's probably only interesting to them when it starts to hit $1B+ in value.\n\nI've heard stories of other people a couple degrees away who have a few million in bitcoin, but I think they just sell on exchanges.

": 3}, ('What do you guys make of this bitstamp assessment?', 6): {'it\'s a bunch of radical assumptions drawn from thin air, aka "evidence" to the author.\n\nEDIT: Let me just knock this one down point by point.  My comments will come after 3 carrots (>>>).\n\n* BitStamp has lost their #1 position to BitFinex >>>  Who cares?  There are lots of things you can do on BitFinex that you can\'t do on BitStamp.  It makes sense that traders would want to go there because they not have better volume than in the past, and they have better options for trading, and they have lower fees.  Why would people not switch if they are active traders?  This point is just dumb.\n\n* The whales have moved from BitStamp to Bitfinex >>>  Exactly what proof do you have of that?  You can\'t just make a claim and back it up by making another even more absurd claim (Whales are talking to each other and have inside information so they fled bitstamp).  That\'s absurd.\n\n* BitFinex doesn\'t place any liquidity with BitStamp anymore, so this is another indicator that something is wrong at BitStamp. >>>   Or maybe Bitfinex just grew up?  Maybe they didn\'t want to be dependent on another exchange?  Maybe they have enough liquidity and traders now that they can operate by themselves?  Nevermind, I must be crazy to think those might be valid answers.\n\n* BitStamp\'s "audit" was attempting to divert attention because the Audit was conducted in november but not announced until March. >>> Are you an accountant?  Do you have any idea what an audit entails?  Audits don\'t occur in a day.  They take time and research to conduct, and auditors don\'t rush through something like that. It\'s completely conceivable to me to think that the data for the audit was pulled in November and the auditors didn\'t complete there work until 2014.  This is just how audits work.  I know because I go through a dozen audits (probably more) a year in my professional career.\n\n* Bitstamp were caught with their pants down with a deceptive fee structure >>> Were they really?  Or did someone just not realize that they could get screwed by having their order eaten up by very small bids, which would in turn cause high fees relative to a normal trade?  Sounds like the latter to me.  I\'ve never had a problem with higher fees than expected.  And the fees are stated right there on the site.  It\'s not like this was some secret.  It was just poor planning on their part because they didn\'t account for this exact situation.  Gotta take the good with the bad, folks.  This is a non-issue in my opinion.  They even responded by changing the minimum trade amount to prevent this.\n\n* BitStamp has overbearing AML/KYC procedures >>> I\'ve honestly only heard a handful of people complaining about this.  I have had no problem going through their AML/KYC process, and it was as easy as any other brokerage account I\'ve set up in the past.  If you just don\'t want to deal with an exchange that requires actual information that can be linked back to you, then you should probably stay away from BitStamp. And if the AML/KYC scares you, then just remove your BTC.  The guy even says "The criminals aren\'t going to comply, and the exchange gets an easy excuse to seize funds."   Basically, he\'s trying to say that the AML/KYC procedures are a bad sign, when in reality BitStamp is doing everything in their power to be above board.\n\n* Mike Hearn\'s audit was crap and not worth the paper it was published on.  >>> I don\'t have a lot of complaints with this one because it was an incomplete audit, so you shouldn\'t bother to treat it like they were audited.  However, the claim that "it doesn\'t cost much for a couple of real accountants for a day".  That\'s blatantly wrong.  A "couple of real accountants" don\'t do audits.  An accounting firm does an audit, and they will want 5 figures before they even set foot in the door of your business.  And it won\'t be for "just a day".  They will be there for at least a week, and then they will take all of their data and spend a few more weeks analyzing it at their own offices.  The costs add up real fast, trust me.\n\n* BitStamp has developed a "discount" that is unreasonable, and this is similar to MtGox\'s discount.  >>> Gox\'s discount was because of known reasons (inability to withdraw fiat).  BitStamp\'s "discount" has actually fluctuated with BTCe and other exchanges over time.  Arbitrage exists, but it is not being done at the level that would keep exchanges priced evenly.  It\'s too difficult to move the fiat in and out of exchanges to accomplish an arbitrage trade easily.\n\n* Traders are experiencing delays when withdrawing BTC from BitStamp.  >>> I\'ve not seen anything on this.  Is this actually a problem? I feel like I\'m pretty tied into what\'s going on in the bitcoin world, and I\'ve not heard about any problems withdrawing BTC from Bitstamp other than someone running into harsher KYC questions.\n\n\n> So, I leave this report with a lot of questions. I cannot say what is wrong, if anything, at Bitstamp because I just don\'t know.\n\nExactly, BtcDrak, you just don\'t know.  You have no idea exactly what you don\'t know either.  The worst part is that you think you actually know something.\n\n\n\n\n\n': 13, "bitfinexs owners are not anonymous, btc-e's are anonymous. finex's owners are available to be reached if need be.": 1, '3 carrots ... yumm .. *drools*.': -1, "Agreed, it's a lot of fluff.

First, take everything you know about exchange order engines and forget it - ANX is completely different, from every exchange on the planet.\n\nOther exchanges have separate order books - one order book for BTCEUR, another for BTCUSD. Trades, pricing, depth is all independent.\nANX on the other hand has a sophisticated engine that streams in FX rates in real-time, and blends all FIAT currencies into a single order book.\n\nOrders placed in BTCEUR can match against orders placed in BTCUSD or any of the 10 major currencies we support.  It's based on a very fair algorithm that converts each existing order into the equivalent price for any incoming order.\nUSD orders are settled in USD, and EUR in EUR.\n\nSome exchanges have attempted to implement a multi-currency offering by first converting orders into a common currency, which is terrible for the customer as they suffer FX slippage.\nIn the case of ANX a USD order rests in USD, and a EUR in EUR. If they match, both parties receive their native currency.\n\nThe volume may appear identical in each of the 11 fiat currencies we support but that is because it is identical; transaction volume could have been executed in any of those 11 fiat currencies.  \n\nWe're the only exchange in the world that offers its customers to execute in their local currency of choice (provided it is one of the 11 currencies we do today).  Customers no longer have to endure poor bank exchange rates and in many cases, they no longer have to rely on expensive wire fees (we now support local banking in Australia, Hong Kong and in Europe, with more on the way).  \n\nThat all being said, we are in active discussions with bitcoincharts.com to more accurately reflect per-currency volumes and the necessary changes should be live in the coming days.  Charting API's will then be able to decide how they want to report our trades.\n\nPlease don't hesitate to post here or contact us at support@anxintl.com should you require any further clarification.

If you\'re going to lead off with that claim, you are going to need to bring some proof and more specific details than just "correlated to high-risk assets".\n\nBTC is not an asset that will be used for a "flight to safety" because it is inherently even more risky than the traditional market place.  BTC is still far too small as a market and has very little penetration into the average investor\'s world.  That will change over time as more people learn about and begin using BTC, but right now we\'re still talking about a very very niche part of the overall investment landscape.\n\nIs the US heading for a recession?  A couple years ago I would have said yes.  However, we\'ve thrown enough money at the economy for years that now the business cycle has turned up and things are generally looking better for the foreseeable future.  Is the stock market overvalued at the moment?  Yes, it is, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean a recession is coming.  We could easily just see a 10%-20% decline in equity valuations (and that would be massive, people would sound like the sky is falling for a bit).  Can corporate profits sustain the current record levels that margins are at? Probably not, but again, that doesn\'t mean a recession is coming just because wall street never factors in mean reversions.\n\nMy advice would be to put down the Zerohedge.com articles, or at least balance them out with some other view points.  \n\nEdit:  The next 6 months for BTC won\'t be about a "flight to safety" or the general public moving into Bitcoin.  This is the Wall Street stage.  I think Peter Diamandis nailed it with his blog post yesterday.  This is when banks and traditional major investment firms will recognize (and legitimize) cryptocurrencies as an investment class.  That will bring about additional regulation, but it will also be the door to opening BTC up to the general public.': 4, "> behaves similarly to a high risk asset\n\nObviously. Anyone with half a brain knows that volatility = risk, and that BTC is incredibly high volatility. \n\n> the first to get dumped in times of uncertainty\n\nhere I'm with /u/bankerfrombtc \n\nIf your commodity is not pegged or correlated with anything traditional and people are exiting the equity markets, it's actually a better choice because it's global. Market correlation is strong within nations, ie the NYSE and S&P tend to move together, even with the TSX. Markets in developing countries will mirror this trend but not 100% so being invested in them eliminates some of your systematic risk. BTC is global and trades all the time, actually making it a better mitigator than investing in other markets in times of uncertainty because you can be certain it will not drop together\n\nEx the price of gold and the price of shares of gold companies. The correlation when gold goes down with gold corporations' share prices is damn near 1, whereas the correlation when gold increases is closer to 0. The difference here is that there is an explanation for the gold/gold share ratios, and I can't find a thing to explain BTC correlation\n\nEdit: that was meant to be a reply to OP\n\nEdit 2: for the 2 people who messaged me: The ratio is correlated on the way down because the cost per ounce that a company works off usually increases steadily as the price of gold goes up, as the company can invest more capital towards production and exploration with a price increase. \n\nWhen gold goes down, in order to keep from going underwater they must scrap these capital intensive projects or eat the loss and hope it's made up by a portfolio of mines with varying costs per ounce. The market reacts accordingly, why be invested in a company that is no longer developing or is making negative income? When the price of gold goes up, the company share prices don't go up as they are simply reinvesting the profits and the horizon of return on those profits is pretty far away, therefore not meriting an instant bump \n\nSource: undergrad thesis on a gold corporation/5 year finance degree/worked in a gold mine/ brother is a senior geologist": 3, "Sorry, so it's not explicitly correlated with any one asset, but it behaves similarly to a high-risk asset.

Not because this kills bitcoin, but you guys gotta understand a shitload of the existing hardware wallets are based off the OLD algorithms and the firmware can\'t handle the new quantum-resistant ones. Everyone has to buy new wallets for maximum security, firmware upgrades are not possible. The most popular wallet, the Snowden series 3000, was deliberately designed so that the firmware *could not* be altered, this was to reduce the attack surface. After the fiasco with Microsoft\'s Delphi X56 wallet no one is using wallets with upgradable firmware again. The public is just too stupid to NOT to press the "flash now" button on the wallet when some trojan/virus/macro in their online computer tells them to "upgrade firmware now to fix security leak!"\n\nAnyway, so most wallets are stuck with the old algorithm.
