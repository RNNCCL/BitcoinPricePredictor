Overfitting generally occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter) relative to the number of observations. A model that has been overfit will generally have poor [predictive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_inference) performance, as it can exaggerate minor fluctuations in the data.\n\n>The possibility of overfitting exists because the criterion used for training the model is not the same as the criterion used to judge the efficacy of a model. In particular, a model is typically trained by maximizing its performance on some set of training data. However, its efficacy is determined not by its performance on the training data but by its ability to perform well on unseen data. Overfitting occurs when a model begins to "memorize" training data rather than "learning" to generalize from trend. As an extreme example, if the number of parameters is the same as or greater than the number of observations, a simple model or learning process can perfectly predict the training data simply by memorizing the training data in its entirety, but such a model will typically fail drastically when making predictions about new or unseen data, since the simple model has not learned to generalize at all.\n\n>The potential for overfitting depends not only on the number of parameters and data but also the conformability of the model structure with the data shape, and the magnitude of model error compared to the expected level of noise or error in the data.\n\n>====\n\n>[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/CcycXH0.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Overfit.png) - *Noisy \\(roughly linear\\) data is fitted to both linear and polynomial functions.

At first I thought I had created something new, but then I was able to map my construction to a standard 60-day EMA.\n\nWhen I ran the algorithm against AAPL and the S&P500 I had to use much higher ratios for buy days - presumably because many savvy investors are already watching those markets.': 2, 'Curious: Why are you using 75% for buying opportunities but 95% for selling opportunities?': 3, 'Gotcha, thanks for the tip.': 1, 'Very nice !': 2, 'Yep, that technique looks like a promising candidate.

I'm planning on tuning it each month to adjust for expectations in volatility. Hopefully I can automate that part too.\n\nInteresting point regarding buy versus sell treatment. My strategy isn't pure trading - which I need to write out in a longer post. This is really focused on reducing your risk while encouraging a buy and hold strategy.\n\nI only sell at local maxima.

It includes ordinary stocks and bonds, *along with the "countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.*  Thus, the coverage of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws is *not limited* to instruments traded at securities exchanges and over-the-counter markets, but **extends to uncommon and irregular instruments**.\n\n>We have repeatedly held that the test "\'is what character the instrument is given in commerce by the terms of the offer, the plan of distribution, and the economic inducements held out to the prospect.\'"': 11, 'I agree ... this gives bitcoin a lot of legality, putting it on par with other currencies.

Buying is easy.  You register, we create a bitcoin address for you, or you can add your own.  We don't care.  You buy, lock in a price, and when your payment clears, we send the bitcoin to the address you chose when you bought.  Done.  We do have AML and KYC to run on you as a customer, and it goes up a notch over $3,000 daily, but that KYC is run on you, not on bitcoin addresses.  Therefore, add whatever ones you would like, it doesn't matter.  We're just removing the step where you would send the bitcoin to an address anyway, so why make it a pain for our users?\n\nSelling is trickier and cooler...  You can only sell from the address created during registration.  The trick here is that during registration, your browser uses javascript to create a private key from your wallet password and other data, this in turn creates your public key and bitcoin address.  The encrypted private key is then sent back to Novauri, but not the unencrypted version.   Then whenever you sell or send bitcoin from this address in the future, you re-enter your wallet PIN, your local browser can recreate the private key from the encrypted private key we send back to you, you sign the sale or send transaction locally, and there you have it.  This is all locked behind a login and mandatory 2FA to keep it safe.  We aren't going to enable a wide open API either, our focus will be on user security, simplicity, and making things safe to the point of dummy proofing them.  \n\nI agree we need a transparent exchange too.

I may borrow some of this, it\'s not easy to explain.\n\nIf the purchaser cancels the order, there\'s several risks, mostly to us.  Here\'s basically how it works...\n\nIf the purchaser was victimized by account takeover fraud (the true owner of the account did not authorize the buy, and it was a fraudster who bought personal info and managed to get by our security - it happens), but the withdrawal is returned within 4 business days, no problem.  We\'ll have bought the bitcoin, but not released it, so there\'s no harm to the account holder.\n\nIf this happens but it\'s after four days, we\'ll have released the bitcoin and have a loss on our hands (we will need to make the victim whole - the fraudster gets away with it here).\n\nNow, if the purchaser decides to close the account or run down their balance, the ACH system is pretty good about getting returns back in 2-3 days.  99% of the time we\'ll cancel the sale and it will net out OK.  Technically, the purchaser just did something bad and broke a contract, so if they do that too many times, we\'ll probably have to turn off their account.  Returned drafts cost $$$, and we can\'t have people gaming the system playing arbitrage games by deliberately bouncing checks, etc.\n\nIt\'s really kind of complicated when I type it out, but yeah, it really depends on the situation.  There are lots of them - and not always account takeover fraud.  Accountholders can be deceased, people get divorced and sometimes it\'s not a pretty divorce, some roomate\'s and "friends"  steal if the customer leaves their phone around and doesn\'t log out... it\'s an ugly world out there sometimes.

I would disagree with you, that certainly means something to a user of the service.  If we were not registered with FinCEN, our accounts would be subject to seizure, which would have a lower impact on our customers due to the fact that we do not behave like a bank, but could still freeze our accounts for transactions that are in process, which would impact users directly.  \n\nAs also outlined in my response, individual States handle consumer protection depending on where you reside, so consumer protection is going to be related to the appropriate department for you based on where you live.  There is also the CFPB; we are being cautious to adhere to Dodd Frank requirements around disclosures (PDS\'s, receipts) as well as error resolution requirements.  \n\nI\'m sincerely confused by how this reflects poorly on Novauri as a reputable company, considering we are doing all of the right things.

Also, I would point out that our competition doesn\'t have a support number after years of being in business, so I\'m not sure why we would be held to a higher standard then they would be.

For example, when I did an entity search in California for both corporations and LLC\'s:\n\n "Results of search for " NOVAURI " returned no entity records."\n\nYour whois record recites a Denver address for Novauri LLC, but the Colorado Secretary of State has no record of a company by that name, and lists a \'415\' phone number (California).\n\nYour terms recite Colorado law, but do not reveal where your compan(ies) are registered.\n\n': 3, '>How do you deal with the time it takes to confirm a transaction while allowing users to control their own private keys? Will I be able to market sell 10BTC instantly from a wallet under my control?\n\nGreat questions.  Novauri uses the same technology found in password manager services like Lastpass to manage private keys.  We store your private keys in encrypted format, but we never have access to clear text private keys, even temporarily.  The private keys are decrypted and encrypted in your local browser using javascript.  This approach combined with other security (SSL, mandatory 2FA, other proprietary and partner anti-fraud that is under the hood) makes for a pretty secure system.  It\'s the same one used by blockchain.info.  \n\nWe require six (6) confirmations to sell bitcoin on our service.  If you want to upload your private keys to electrum, core, or some other service, that\'s fine.  We don\'t care.  The confirmations are before you can sell on Novauri.  You can only sell from the address created during registration.  The same is true to send from Novauri.  6 confirmations.  Again, you can take your private keys and do what you want with them, but on our site we follow a 6 confirmation rule (for now).\n\nYes on your edit.  Correct.  Very similar, except we\'re starting out of the gate never taking deposits or acting like a bitcoin bank.  \n\nNote: we still aren\'t in the "wallet" business.  We don\'t want people storing a ton of bitcoin using their Novauri address, even though we don\'t have the private keys.  We\'re still a centralized service, and while it\'s much harder for someone shady on our end to steal, and our design is mostly "gox proof", you still should be using paper wallets or cold storage for large sums.  We plan to actively nag people who leave too much bitcoin on our site as a service to them.  ': 5, "Holy cow...  these are some detailed questions.

Also in Chicago and Louisiana as well.  And now New York.  Think that's it.  Denver is the big one.  I live in Denver presently, but also spend many years in San Francisco, which is why my phone has a 415 area code (please don't dox me - I have enough calls from sales people).\n\n>Where do you have offices with people in them? Have you or are you registering your Delaware entity in these jurisdictions?\n\nI can't answer if we've registered as a foreign entity because that would also reveal how people are paid.  Salary requires a foreign entity, equity right now doesn't because we are not yet profitable.  I'll say that we will be registered as a foreign entity before we pay anyone salary, if we haven't done so already.  It's easy to do anyway.\n\n>Will you be obtaining business licenses in California, Colorado and Delaware (others?)? \n\nI am not sure what you mean by business licenses.  It's an online service with no physical retail location doing business.  We have one agent (the site) doing business in all 50 States, barring any regulatory hangups before we go to beta.  We are subject to regulation by FinCEN as a money transmitter if that's what you mean?  I may be confused on this one or forgotten some of the paperwork.  There's a lot of paperwork.\n\n>If so, what kind of business licenses will you be obtaining? State licensing is mentioned on your about page, but again not very specific about what you will be licensed for.\n\nWe are subject to regulation by the US Treasury (FinCEN) as a money transmitter Federally, and must approach each US State that issues MSB licenses individually and either confirm we are clear to do business, get a signed no action letter, or in some cases become a licensed money transmitter.  This is an expensive and grueling process that takes a long time and is very expensive.  It's also highly competitive information that really isn't public or appropriate to share because it would put us at a competitive disadvantage.

It's a fast way to make a lot of money if you're lucky or know what you're doing and vice versa. Also, if you sell at a loss, meaning if you bought high and sold low, you lock in that loss forever. If a trade goes against you, it's wise to wait and see if the price comes back to where you were hoping it was going. But on a contrary note, only you can decide when it's gone too far to accept that loss. Sample: you bought $1200, it's now at $800. You need to decide before hand what your risk tolerance is because it may be years before it gets back up to $1201. A lot of people are still holding on to some very expensive coins because they failed to see that it would've been wiser to sell at 800 and buy back in lower. They were hoping or were told that it's going to $2000. Being able to interpret the charts would've told them otherwise. If you bought at 350 and tomorrow morning it's at 320, you need to know now what you're going to do and follow through with your plan. Hold or sell.

Heh.\n\nFor one thing, it\'s not designed to be used as an "outproxy" to browse normal websites (although it can), but rather as a self-contained network that\'s all served through I2P. Like .onion sites, though these use .i2p. They\'re also typically human-readable, instead of Tor\'s garbled (and phishing-prone) random-derived .onions.\n\nIt works a bit like BitTorrent in that when you use it, you typically also help relay other traffic, so that it self-scales as more people use it and it can support sudden growth and high-bandwidth applications (like BitTorrent - there\'s an integrated BT client in I2P and a few I2P-only trackers). These are crucial things that Tor cannot (and will not) do.\n\nSince, when configured, your I2P router (as the running software is called) is constantly relaying encrypted traffic, it provides much higher security than Tor against timing and correlation attacks, which have largely been considered the #1 threat against anonymity tools like this. That\'s because your own traffic is shadowed by lots of cover traffic, so that it\'s not possible for a passive observer to determine when you might be accessing a particular "eepsite" (what I2P websites are called), or starting a particular torrent on I2P, or sending a chat message on the I2P IRC network, etc.\n\nIt also has a much more open and accessisible developer community, in my opinion, and there\'s a lot of back-and-forth between the devs and the users in a very healthy manner. You can see that in action at http://zzz.i2p once you get your router set up.\n\nSome drawbacks, as compared to Tor: relying on volunteer nodes that are using home connections is less reliable and slower than using Tor\'s fixed network of largely datacenter-based relays. So, it\'s a bit like using a 56k modem, and every now and then an eepsite will fail to load (if one of the nodes relaying your traffic suddenly drops out without performing a "graceful shutdown" which would wait for their routing commitments to expire). But it\'s not unusual to get speeds >100 kBps when downloading a torrent, for instance.\n\nAlso, since the network of "nodes" is constantly shifting, and I2P doesn\'t rely on single points of failure like Tor\'s "Introducers," it takes a little while after installing it for I2P to get enough useful information about the network, like a list of current nodes and their status. So generally, after installing, you want to set up the network settings and then let it "reseed" itself with fresh network information for a half hour or so (or even better, overnight) before expecting it to work well. I2P works best (for you and for others) when routers are online 24/7 or close to it, so many people leave it running as a background service on their computer.\n\nThat\'s a pretty good introduction, I suppose!

To counter this risk, you can do Dollar Cost averaging (since your buy-in price will be an average of different price points over a given period). Don't confuse what OP wrote with DCA, though. With DCA, you're not supposed to buy more when the price drops or anything like that. You buy a predetermined dollar amount at a predetermined frequency. If you start trying to time your buys, you're not technically dollar cost averaging anymore.\n\nSo to conclude, DCA is simply a tool to reduce variability on your buy-in point. It is useful for people that are aware they can't time the market to buy on a low point and don't want to risk buying on a temporary high.": 1, "So you sell 1 coin and hold 1? When does that make sense?\n\nIf you expect the price to rise some more, then you shouldn't have sold the coin.\n\nIf you expect the price short-term to drop some, you should have sold both coins.\n\nStep 1 and 2 make sense, depending on your expectation and your strategy. Step 3 never really makes sense, except to lower your exposure, but then your strategy is inconsistent with step 2, in which you didn't seem to have a problem with increased exposure.": 0, 'This is such a simple idea, you literally covered the whole notion.

I don't know if that's possible but there might be write offs for some stuff.\n\nI guess all that's important is that DCA is a two way street if you're into speculating/trading.

You buy a second coin at $250: avg $375.5/coin\n3. You sell a coin at $300: avg $450/coin\n\nAs you can see, the third step didn't further reduce your average, but it did the contrary.\n\nSo if you believe Bitcoin will eventually grow, holding remains the best option (without exposing you to increased risks by day-trading).\n\nWhat OP wrote, though, is more day-trading than dollar cost averaging.

Right now while it's bearish for almost a year more profitable strategy would be cost averaging into dollars, especially the variant where you are selling on peaks.

In fact, DCA in this instance would net you less loss than having accumulated your stake all at once earlier in the year.\n\n\nBasically I think you\'re trying to blame your "system" when really the system itself is fine; the only problem, in this case, is the bear market that Bitcoin has suffered throughout the year.': 2, "Indeed.

How it works: There will be 5 ETF shares per coin. When demand falls, COIN sells BTC so that this ratio holds. When demand rises, COIN buys BTC so that this ratio holds. The value of the ETF reflects an underlying security (BTC), so they need to buy and sell BTC to manage the ETF. Demand should go up due to point #1.\n\n3. Importantly, liquidity and network effects.

Still, trading is about money and the fee is astronomical compared to other options.\n\nIf you are really into high leverage daytrading with significant volume then you can try futures at 796.\n\nI've been using 796 for the past couple of months and apart from the uncharacteristic downtime they had due to a ddos the other day I have no complaints. Fast executions, good volume, 20:1 leverage. The trading interface could be tailored better to allow for one-click order submissions without much typing, but it's still very usable.\n\n": 2, "This site blows, the fees and swap costs are out of control.  Even if you pick the right direction for the market to move, you'll likely lose money unless the swing is huge.\n\nStay away, use 796.com like everyone else.": 2, 'Not the point.': 2, 'There are a few things to keep in mind when using 796. \n\n>I never thought 796 was a serious exchange\n\nI don\'t really consider them as "A serious exchange". 796 is not on the level of Bitstamp or Bitfinex in my mind, despite having much higher volume, as it\'s futures trading only. I do trust them with a significant amount of my daytrading bankroll, but I always withdraw profits above a certain amount to be safe. I suggest not parking too many bitcoins there for safety reasons. Again, i have no clear reasons *not* to trust them, but on the flip side there are no clear reasons to trust them more than a smaller exchange that is legally based in a tax haven.\n\nSecondly, volume tends to be much higher when China is awake. Make sure you keep this in mind as both the book and the volume tend to thin out considerably during the "off hours". Don\'t get caught in huge positions when it\'s bed time in China and don\'t get over-leveraged, every cent matters when we are talking about high leverage.\n\nThirdly, the price tends to move around quite a bit in comparison to the index price. Up to 6-8 dollars off the index price is normal, depending on where Bitcoin is heading and the day of the week. You can more or less disregard it if it\'s in that range when it comes to trading decisions. Also, 796 mainly follows the Chinese exchanges. Stamp or Finex spiking doesn\'t do much for the price by itself if China doesn\'t follow.\n\nThat\'s about it. Have fun trading!': 1, '[removed]': -6, 'On 796 you can leverage 5:1, 10:1, 20:1, and cover the fees after about 12 cents.  If you want something a bit longer term try Huobi and OKCoin quarterly futures.\n\nGet out of the stone age everyone has abandoned btc.sx': 1, "You just have to do a simple search to see A LOT of questionable things 796 has done including going down during the biggest market movements.

The fact that they are or at least *appear* to be "under the radar" means I don\'t worry about being wrongly ensnared by KYC or similar banking regulations unlike with a certain broker (*cough* coinbase.) Admittedly I have no hard  evidence for these feelings other than the fact that they make a lot of money and they have every incentive to continue to make a lot of money.
