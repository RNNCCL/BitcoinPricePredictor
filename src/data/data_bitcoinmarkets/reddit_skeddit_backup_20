The outputs from farmland property can vary drastically from year to year, and an area of hearty soil now could be mired in a 30 year drought a century from now. You could also lose land to natural disasters, hostile takeovers, rising water tables, or even government appropriation via eminent domain. Exxon could pull an Enron and collapse completely under a bubble of exaggerated financial success - or emerging technologies could severely disrupt the oil production and distribution markets.

They know that once they own enough of the coins for sale, they will have much more control and can push the price upwards. However, they can\'t do this when there is still excess supply in the market. Why? Because profit takers will sell their supply immediately on any price rise, damping their efforts. The market makers need a fast, sustained rise to draw in new buyers and make the shorts run for cover. So they use shakeouts to scare any remaining coins out of hiding. These are low volume price drops, designed to give weak hands a false impression of the direction of the price. By spending a little extra of their capital on these, they can build their position even more while testing the market\'s reaction to the shakeout.

What I will say, is that I\'ve noticed an odd shift in perspective from traders on the subreddit since we hit 480 a while ago. Before that moment, the permabulls were in full force, and a turnaround was just around the corner. Since then, the sentiment has been (in my opinion) steadily shifting in the opposite direction. That is to say, any posts that say "the price is definitely dropping below 300, and its going to hit 250/275/[some number derived from charts based on a price where 650k coins and who knows how much capital were taken off the table by mtgox]" is upvoted, and most bullish sentiment is either questioned, downvoted, or remains stagnant. \n\nMany of the permabulls (20% in terms of capital so far, judging by the drop from 26m in long positions to 21m) have shifted into bear mode, in an attempt (again, my opinion) to make back some of the losses from the year long bear market. I guess my point is to ask yourself a question. How many people can make money on a bottom at $275, if everyone thinks the bottom is going to be at $275? \n\nPersonally, I don\'t feel that $1,000,000 a day in USD entering the Bitcoin economy globally is unreasonable, especially with all the increased value and media attention. And at 3600 coins mined per day, that\'s the amount that needs to come into the system to negate inflation, if literally 100% of all mined coins get sold on the markets (and I think 100% of anything is a ludicrous figure, I\'d say its closer to 60%. Not every mining operation is running at a loss, someone somewhere is holding mined coins at this price. Like, come on.) If you feel that there\'s less than $1,000,000 coming into the system per day, take a look at the more than $300,000,000 in VC money alone that\'s been invested into the Bitcoin space this year. That\'s basically a million a day right there, and that\'s not counting people buying of their own accord (granted, that money is going to create value later as opposed to buy coins now, but still, the demand is obviously there). Perhaps the price will decline a bit more due to panic selling, and I can\'t account for panic, because I\'m looking at the situation from a purely input/output standpoint.

For example, think of a credit card terminal.\n\nWell, a bitcoin terminal would just have a single small hash chip in it that maybe does a few GH's, **it loses money**, but the operator of it can afford it because them losing maybe $0.50/$1 dollar a day in hashing is peanuts.

That event was disastrous for peoples moods, and I say this from my personal experience. My perspective was shifted there, as I have an emotional attachment to Bitcoin as a whole, and the euphoria of "omg maybe Bitcoin is actually finally out of the bear market, my emotional attachment has been validated!!" Caused myself (and other traders) to avoid taking a profit in the 400 range. When the price deflated back to its prior range, the reality of the situation sunk in, and more than a little bit of jealousy/resentment was felt for the permabears, who over the past year have been consistently raking in profits. \n\nMore than once, I considered taking a bearish position, I mean, who wouldn\'t? The bears were obviously making profits, and had been for a full year. I realized I needed to take a step back, and look at the situation from as emotionally removed a view as I could. \n\nLooking at the "fundamentals" (that\'s the first time I\'ve used that term, I usually cringe at it, as you probably also do), the price appears to be in equilibrium, money in over the course of the year is approximately equal to the money out (mining returns), and if it isn\'t, then its damn close. Personally, I\'m leveraged in a position that would liquidate around the $250 range (it would be dumb to tell you my exact margin call price). If that target is hit, I feel something has gone terribly wrong with my evaluation of a fair market price, and I probably deserve to lose my money. \n\nBy leveraging in at around $320 (I know, the current price is lower than my cost basis, hindsight is 20/20) I feel that my risk to reward is relatively safe, and the profits I can make from the leverage exceed or equal what I could make if I sold my coins without margin now, and be one of the few traders who actually manage to catch the bottom somewhere around $275. I\'m not one to gamble, and I\'m putting my money not on being able to accurately call the bottom of a year-long bear market, but instead on catching the upswing from a rise once the bottom is finally hit, wherever it may be.\n\nYou\'re correct, perspective is necessary, and I wasn\'t trying to tell people off who take a position opposite to mine. In fact, I really was cautioning people on what the so-called "pigs" do, that is, trying to call tops and bottoms in a volatile market.

They are often oversimplified.\n\nWhile they are traditionally defined as "sideways movements on declining volume that break out in the direction of the previous trend," it\'s important to note that the activity inside the pattern is hugely important. Whether it is (re)accumulation by speculators that sold higher, (re)distribution to buyers in anticipation of a markdown, or neither (or both!) will affect which direction the price will ultimately move as the pattern nears its close. \n\nQuestions to ask are: \n\n* Is buying or selling volume greater inside of the pattern?\n* Is there absorption of supply (or capping of demand) within the pattern?\n* Is the continuation slanted upward or downward? Upward movement would suggest distribution to buyers at higher prices in preparation for a markdown, while downward movement would suggest the opposite: Accumulation by dominant players at cheaper prices in anticipation of a markup.\n\nI like to think of continuation patterns as sideways moments where supply and demand are in relative harmony. They can and do occur on every timescale. As they play out, accumulation and distribution forces (buyers and sellers) interact as each individual finishes taking his or her position. This is why volume decreases.

It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to note that while China may be leading trading volume, the US is in the lead for daily transaction volume.

Most [algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) are designed to work with inputs of arbitrary length. Usually, the efficiency or running time of an algorithm is stated as a function relating the input length to the number of steps ([time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)) or storage locations ([space complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_complexity)).\n\n>Algorithm analysis is an important part of a broader [computational complexity theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory), which provides theoretical estimates for the resources needed by any algorithm which solves a given [computational problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_problem). These estimates provide an insight into reasonable directions of search for [efficient algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency).\n\n>In theoretical analysis of algorithms it is common to estimate their complexity in the asymptotic sense, i.e., to estimate the complexity function for arbitrarily large input. [Big O notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_O_notation), [Big-omega notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-omega_notation) and [Big-theta notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-theta_notation) are used to this end. For instance, [binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search) is said to run in a number of steps proportional to the logarithm of the length of the list being searched, or in O(log(n)), colloquially "in [logarithmic time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_time)". Usually [asymptotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis) estimates are used because different [implementations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation) of the same algorithm may differ in efficiency. However the efficiencies of any two "reasonable" implementations of a given algorithm are related by a constant multiplicative factor called a *hidden constant*.\n\n>\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Probabilistic ^analysis ^of ^algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probabilistic_analysis_of_algorithms) ^| [^Polylogarithmic ^function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polylogarithmic_function) ^| [^Deterministic ^algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_algorithm) ^| [^Worst-case ^complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worst-case_complexity) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cn66aja) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cn66aja)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)': 1, 'Never go full leverage.

Clearly the column of Os dropped to a 52 week low at $167.  That long pole warning reversed quickly which would have allowed for quite a pick up.  The price shot back up a little more than half way up the pole, as usual.\n\nWe then dropped back down about half down THAT line.  We settled into the range where we are today.\n\nYesterday we broke through the positive break out signal, hitting a high of $239.  At this positive break out the amount of strength going into it is waning.  The last time we had a positive break 9 columns back.  And it was only one box higher.  That does not bode well for this reversal.\n\nSo, as of this break out we can look at the last positive breakout and count one block higher.  That means our target high is $240.  If we look at it using the width of the formation, we are looking at growth of 4 blocks.  Not much better.  That high would be around $255.\n\nHere is the rub:  Watch the currency markets.  I have to believe with the QE announced in Europe and the currency issues around the world (Russia, Africa, Switzerland, etc) that people will start looking at Bitcoin to secure some assets.  Not all of their assets, but some of them.  It will allow people to transfer some assets across borders without government control.\n\nI do not want to sound like a tinfoil hat idiot, but after the devaluation of currency, capital controls come next.  That is just the way its always been done.  Think ahead a few steps.

The coin sale on the market is compensated by the purchase of the coin on the same market, or by the fact that the mined coin would have been sold on the market anyway.\n\nBitcoin has two mains usages, store of value and medium of exchange. If merchant adoption increases, the money aggregate necessary to support this medium of exchange role increases, i.e. the amount of bitcoins necessary to support merchant usage increases. This is bullish. Saying that merchant adoption is a cause of crash is equivalent to saying that the Microsoft announcement was bad for Bitcoin.': 3, 'Don\'t mention "market manipulation"..

Mostly the interesting bit is that stuff is continuing to get worse in a bunch of directions. So bad, I believe we are in the beginnings of another crisis like 2008. These are super long term effects, and may not materialize for some time. But the health of our global economy is so bad that something is going to catastrophically break sooner or later.\n\n------------\n\nFirst up, a political quickie. [Syriza, a leftist party in Greece may win power and then refuse to pay its debts.](http://www.ekathimerini.com/4dcgi/_w_articles_wsite1_1_01/01/2015_545865) I'm pretty excited by this, a leftist party could disrupt the current system in a quite good direction. If Greece goes left, Spain and then others may follow. Even Ireland is entertaining leftist politics these days. I'm getting more political than economic though...\n\nThe main point here is that the Greek economy is on fire, and the Greek people are considering leaving the Euro with this extreme political shift. That is potentially bad news for the Eurozone economy.\n\n------------\n\nSecondly, currency war continues to deepen. Since the last macro update, the leader of the european central bank (Mario Draghi) made some remarks, and [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/business/stress-test-for-mario-draghi.html) great NYTimes article summarizes the landscape around it pretty well.  \n\n>Emphasizing every word, Mr. Draghi said that the bank\xe2\x80\x99s governing council had just agreed to prepare \xe2\x80\x9cfor further measures, which could, if needed, be implemented in a timely manner.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nIt's funny how they hang on every word, but due to this they are expecting QE in the Euro eventually. Some people the article interviews are *positive* about QE in the Euro. Really bizarre, like medical experts recommending heaps of cloth that do nothing except soak up the blood.\n\nThe dollar is losing the currency war at the moment (yes, losing by being more valuable). You can see in the last 6 months the value of the dollar rising against the next strongest currency, the Euro [here](http://www.xe.com/currencycharts/?from=USD&to=EUR&view=1Y). More value for the dollar is bad for EVERYONE, because most debts worldwide are denominated in dollars. Debts getting larger is what leads to recessions and crashes, especially when 90% of your money supply is debts.\n\nThis also prevents the FED from increasing interest rates, as they've almost promised to do. One of my favorite [dances](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/B5ESiP3CAAAr-Iz.png:large)!\n\n-------------\n\nLastly, and my favorite, oil prices continue to tank! We've got US crude oil under [$48](http://i.imgur.com/rdRI1uY.png) per barrel. In the short term, this is great for pretty much everyone. Costs come down, for any good that is shipped anywhere. In the long term, this puts a damper on oil industry (huge) growth, and may cause some defaults in many oil producing companies and nations.\n\nAll production methods profitable above $50 are [no longer profitable](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2015-01-05/oil-below-60-tests-u-s-drive-for-energy-independence.html) due to this crash. \n\n>Halliburton Co., the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest provider of fracking services to oil companies, announced Dec. 11 that it would dismiss 1,000 workers. Two months earlier, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave Lesar said \xe2\x80\x9cour sector will be fine\xe2\x80\x9d if oil prices range between $80 and $100 a barrel.\n\nKeep this implication in mind. The recent drop in price is an effect of the combined forces of increasing supply *and* decreasing demand. Demand is decreasing for no-one-knows-exactly-why, and supply is increasing due to primarily Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is the trigger for this price drop, they are the player that changed how they were playing the game. Previous to about 6 months ago, Saudi Arabia was throttling production to fix price artificially high for the OPEC team. They have removed that throttle. There are many highly oil-revenue dependent casualties of this action, from Venezuela to Russia, but the real target was the US. Saudi Arabia is the big stack at the table right now, and the thing they fear most is being overtaken. That's why supply started rising in close proximity to this article: [US Seen as Biggest Oil Producer After Overtaking Saudi Arabia](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-07-04/u-s-seen-as-biggest-oil-producer-after-overtaking-saudi.html). \n\nThey are pulling a reverse Dune strategy, and it looks like it's going to work!\n\n------------\n\nEdit: I forgot the most important part, the connection to BTC and price! Basically, any crash in asset markets or uncertainty in economy makes money flock towards safe assets. The only reason Bitcoin is not seen as safe is it's relative recency and halo of scams. When it gets more good publicity, it will be seen to be the superior value storing technology that it is.

I want people to riot for space and run the price of hosting up.\n\nAnd the numbers are easy enough. ASICSPACE on bitcointalk is offering 10 cents/kwh to people with just one or two machines. So that\'s your ceiling. From what I hear, Bitfury is paying about 5 cents to run their own DC. That\'s the range. We know the price. We know difficulty.\n\nI want people to go "shit this is so profitable" and pay me the 20-25 cents/kwh.\n\nI don\'t sell miners. I want competition. I\'m giving you the real numbers that are out there now.\n\nI dream of a day when mining is super profitable again.\n\nEdit: What I don\'t want is more competition in hosting. So there is my bias. I want people to believe the price is as low as possible to host. (Although, seriously, I\'m giving you my best guesstimates.) I run a DC for only large clients. They get 24/7 service in a good jurisdiction (Canada) at the lowest prices.\n\n2nd Edit: My "numbers" also say there is 10-15MW (aprox. 30 PH) of new Bitmain, Spondoolies and others machines that aren\'t even plugged in because no one is buying. My sources tell me Bitmain, Spondoolies and others have all stopped new production and it would take 60-90 days to restart.

Data centres are very expensive to run, and the Spondoolies/Bitmains are not sitting on the piles of cash you think they are, the upfront costs of development of the next chips are in the $40-50 million range.\n\nCointerra, bankrupt. Black Arrow, insolvent. KNC, laying people off.\n\nYes, they were rolling in money just 6 months ago, but the song being played has changed. Just like how the oil companies now are starting to feel pain.\n\nI run a very large mine, so I think I can weigh in. No one in the industry has sub 5 cents/kwh costs, all-in incl. electricity, overhead, facilities, infrastructure, employees etc. Right now, at that super low price, no one is making more than 75%, which I agree is a great margin. (Edit: and that margin excludes the cost of the miner) However, with a 15% rise, that\'s going to be cut badly. The market can\'t sustain another difficulty doubling. It can\'t even sustain another 50% rise at $280 bitcoin.\n\nAlso, consider that some of these miners put their equipment in places with much higher costs. Cointerra pays far more than 5 cents/kwh, probably over 10 cents/kwh, as do most of the major companies. The "big" guys pay closer to 7 and 8 cents per kwh at most of their DCs. (These are all-in costs, not just electricity.) I know, because I\'ve seen the contracts, I compete for their business. I know what I have to quote to get people to fill space.\n\nRun the math for yourself, mining is only profitable now if you have free machines. Even a Spondoolies or a Bitmain can\'t cover the cost of production fast enough by mining for themselves without risking bankruptcy.\n\nIf we get back to $400+ bitcoin, my tune will change, then it is all sunshine and lollipops. But right now, no one is making enough money to justify producing miners at the pace they were. And like all business, they all have debts to service. They can\'t tell their supplies to wait until the bitcoin price recovers. The suppliers don\'t care what a bitcoin is or what it is worth. They need cash.\n\nAnd remember how manufacturing works. That 15% difficulty rise is not from miners ordered in the last month. Those miners were ordered by the Spondoolies/Bitmain from their suppliers 90 to 120 days ago. The suppliers don\'t sit around waiting for the next miner order, they\'ll make something else in the mean time.\n\nYou\'ll see difficulty really trail price if we see another rally.': 7, 'Why would you not turn off your miners the moment they become unprofitable?\nAt that point you should calculate how much btc you could earn with your hashrate and just buy that amount every week.': 3, "Most all Chinese manufacturing is money up front.

Even the manufacturers.\n\nThe miners did host for themselves when the hosters wanted 20-25 cents per kwh. Because that\'s what data centres charge for website hosting/servers/cloud computing. If you go to a normal DC, that\'s what they charge.\n\nBitcoin mining is a different creature. DC\'s can only exist for bitcoin mining in low cost energy jurisdictions. So they did move them "in house". But it has been a disaster. Cointerra is bankrupt. They have their own huge farm, and are still bankrupt. Explain that for me?\n\nThe Chinese have stopped building farms, their electricity prices are to high. (But I\'m sure you knew that.) KNC\'s mine is break even at these prices.\n\nThe lowest cost mine, in the world, is mine. Quite honestly. But I only deal with large miners. The only other places that can compete in this market are the operations in Washington and Oregon, and in the Republic of Georgia. (Edit: And maybe Quebec, Manitoba, Finland, Iceland.

As the available supply of BTC for drug buyers dwindles and the demand increases (which is guaranteed to happen if the BTC market cap is too low to support the darknet markets because too much coin will begin to be stuck in escrow) then the price will increase to some relatively stable amount.

The question is, what price will the last BTC trade for (where "last" refers to the market clearing price).  So for example, lets say everyone on the darknet markets think BTC should be worth $100 and they want it to be worth $100.  But... the holders of 10 million BTC just keep selling and selling and offering BTC at a price of $1.

That was true 2 years ago, but that world no longer exists.  There are now futures markets, so there's no limit to the velocity of money.  Customer makes a purchase on Silk Road for 100 BTC, and that is held in escrow for a month by the site.  But the merchant will of course want to monetize the payment as soon as possible, so they'll sell the 100 BTC forward on an exchange immediately.  That makes the 100 BTC instantly available for additional buyers, making the escrow irrelevant.  This means that the bulk of BTC being used for commerce will always be on sale, which removes the link between darknet transactions and price.  In your model, the customer will buy up as many BTC as necessary to make their transaction which does indeed put a floor under BTC, but since those same BTC are immediately offered again, that floor is defined by the market cap necessary to support a single (or maybe a few hours) worth of transactions.

They're just making wild claims which they can't support, and they typically haven't even thought through their own claims logically.\n\nFront running is like scalping.  It's not like gambling where one side wins and one side loses.  **IF** an exchange is front running, then they are really just diving in ahead of their customer trades, which would mean they are trading the trend.  Front running occurs in fractions of a second because you can't front run until you know the incoming trade.  On top of that, you can't front run with the same level of volume of the customer orders that are being front run.  It has to be done in smaller quantities than the original order being front run because you're basically stealing the trade and forcing the original trader to pay down/up depending on the trade.  If every time a trader goes to move a block of BTC and they see an equal sized or larger block of BTC get traded, they will quickly realize they are being front run.\n\nFront running is not like robbing a bank where you get massive sums of money from it.

True bitcoiners are a highly technical and proficient bunch, and it\'s growing a lot tougher to conceal nefarious acts from the community.  People are watching, always watching.  On top of that, it also doesn\'t make a lot of sense to outright front run your clients because that\'s a bit like "killing the golden goose".

Someone with access to MTGOX's database took control of a big account on MTGOX. 100k coins were sold, pushing the price down to $0.01 each. Another 400k coins were reported missing. Karpeles said: \n\n>One account with a lot of coins was compromised and whoever stole it (using a HK based IP to login) first sold all the coins in there, to buy those again just after, and then tried to withdraw the coins. **The $1000/day withdraw limit was active for this account and the hacker could only get out with $1000 worth of coins.** Apart from this no account was compromised, and nothing was lost. Due to the large impact this had on the Bitcoin market, we will rollback every trade which happened since the big sale, and ensure this account is secure before opening access again. \n\nhttp://www.dailytech.com/Inside+the+MegaHack+of+Bitcoin+the+Full+Story/article21942.htm#sthash.0GifpLqc.dpuf\n\nWait, what? If the hacker had access to an account with 100k bitcoins, and the account didn't have a high enough limit to withdraw more than $1000 USD worth, then what would the hacker do? \n\n1. Create another account with a $1000 USD limit\n2. Place a bid to buy 100,000 bitcoins at .01 USD  each (100,00 * .01 = $1000),\n3. Crash the price to .01 USD, by instantly selling into every bid on the orderbook.\n4. Eat the losses incurred by selling into existing bids.\n5. Now, withdraw your 100,000 bitcoins ($1000 value) less losses and fees.\n\n**Mark Karpeles never explained why this plan wouldn't/didn't work.** Seems perfectly workable. I suspect that the hack *did* work, and he'd been operating a fractional reserve ever since, possibly with the support of an early adopter with tons of bitcoin (who would have an interest in convincing everyone that everything was fine) who agreed to help cover any immediate withdrawals. \n\nLet's look at the bitcoin days destroyed data for that period: \n\n17/06/2011 18:15:05,21641611\n\n18/06/2011 18:15:05,3500241.0\n\n**19/06/2011 18:15:05,7006559.0**\n\n**20/06/2011 18:15:05,13712116**\n\n21/06/2011 18:15:05,2213245.0\n\n22/06/2011 18:15:05,1697123.0\n\n\nThe hack was on 19/06/2011 and MTGOX was quickly shut down. If the hack was only on the exchange (not the blockchain) and the bitcoin weren't actually moved, why were all these bitcoins being moved on the blockchain? Where were all these bitcoins being moved from and to? \n\nMaybe it was panicked customers withdrawing all their bitcoin. Possibly. But weren't withdrawals unavailable because the site was shut down? And what about the $1000 limit?

Volume picked up by at least 20,000 BTC but with lots of selling pressure. Expect to see this kind of downward pressure till at least Dec.31 because many traders will be selling to maximize capital losses to reduce their annual taxes.\n\nI also expect lots of buying pressure on Jan. 1, 2015 as many of those traders will be re-establishing their holdings, buying back in once the tax year has come to an end. This tactic can significantly offset any gains made this year. Also it\xe2\x80\x99s important to remember that Bitcoins can only be taxed if sold for fiat or used to buy goods/services. Simply holding Bitcoin is not a taxable event. If you get paid in Bitcoin, you may be able to reduce your income bracket by carrying them over to other years.\n\nIt may be risky to take a long position until the year ends. That said I feel bullish about going long in the new year.\n\nTo maximize profits, it may be a good idea to have Bitcoins on cold storage as a long term investment, while day/swing trading Bitcoin in the markets. If you have long term holdings, then this will give you a degree of immunity from chasing hype and buying in at peak levels during a bull rush. People generally chase markets if they have no long term holdings to benefit from prices soaring.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to note the opinions about Bitcoin based on current market prices.

This shows that most people\xe2\x80\x99s opinions are still at the whims of reacting to the markets. This is also why most people lose money trading.\n\nPersonally, I\xe2\x80\x99m taking a contrarian position and forecasting a bull trend for next year as a part of our biennial cycle.

It's funny because we all only got one side of the story via SA-DY's original testimony last week, and we ran pretty rampant with speculation and rumors. Now the full story comes out, and it's actually rather boring. ": 2, 'Here\'s your summary level read through folks:\n\n*  First couple paragraphs are just attacking the fact that the Defense even got to ask the types of questions they got to ask of Special Agent Der-Yeghiayan (who will from here on out be referred to as SA-DY).  Basically, they are trying to assert that SA-DY provided his opinions which were all based off inadmissible evidence and hearsay.  Because the evidence presented by the defense against Karpeles is thin and circumstantial, all of it should be thrown out (is the argument they are proffering here).\n\n*  Next they go into SA-DY\'s investigation of Karpeles.  First, he looked into Karpeles because of the website silkroadmarket.org being hosted on a server controlled by Karpeles (via a company he owned).  Second, SA-DY believed Karpeles had a motive to operate SR, which was to generate demand for BTC, which would drive more people to MtGox.  Third, SA-DY noticed that certain websites he believed to be associated with Karpeles had been created with certain software that was also used to create portions of the Silk Road website.  Based on that, SA-DY got a warrant in Mid-August 2013 for certain email accounts used by Karpeles.\n\n*  That warrant revealed no further evidence linking Karpeles to the silk road, and it actually made SA-DY aware that Karpeles ran a webhosting service called Kalyhost, and that the silkroadmarket.org website actually belonged to a customer of Kalyhost, which could be confirmed by email correspondence from the owner or silkroadmarket.org about a customer support question.\n\n*  Kalyhost records show the customer running the silkroadmarket.org site was one "Richard Page".  Ulbricht\'s laptop, which was seized during his arrest, had a folder marked "aliaces" (sic) which listed Richard Page as an alias, and also included a physical address (which matched Kalyhost records) and noted that the alias had been used to rent a server from kalyhost.\n\n*  Then there\'s a clarification on the Baltimore DHS branch interviewing Karpeles\' lawyers.  What they clarify is that Karpeles\' lawyers only offered for Karpeles to give up information on a person he **suspected** might be operating the Silk Road in exchange for immunity on any other pressing charges.  They tried to setup a subsequent face to face meeting with Karpeles in Guam, but it never happened apparently.\n\n*  Then they jump to right after Ulbrichts arrest, and they talk about Karpeles reaching out to the DHS to potentially provide information about the suspiscious MtGox account that he had previously mentioned to the Baltimore DHS.  They also said they found records of an account in Ulbrichts name and were willing to share that information as well.\n\n*  The suspicious MtGox account was opened by an email address "davidmaisana@inbox.com", though later when needing to verify his identity, the user submitted docs for a person by a completely different name from the original email address.  \n\n*  That suspicious account at MtGox had deposited a large amount of BTC, sold the stash into fiat (approximately $2M at the time), and then eventually bought back into BTC and transferred the BTC out of MtGox.  AFTER the BTC was transferred out, the user contacted MtGox saying that he could not access the account and that it had been "hacked".  MtGox reported they told the user that his credentials had been changed according to a valid user request, and the customer never inquired again.  There is no record of this "theft" ever being reported to police or authorities.\n\n*  DHS was able to tie the "davidmasiano@inbox.com" account to Ross Ulbricht several ways.  The account at Gox was consistently accessed from IP addresses they can tie to Ulbricht, as well as transactional records they found in his Gmail account.\n\n*  After that they spend 5-6 pages going over all the reasons the Defense should be precluded from questioning SA-DY about Karpeles, etc.': 75, 'does that include the really serious shit like the hit?\n\nbtw, excellent post have a bitcorn /u/changetip private': 2, "Vendors weren't able to hedge their balance against volatility.

Our system takes the position from the user, effectively closing him out. So lets say our system takes it at $215.

We would then return the $5 to the user; they can see this by going to the Transaction tab and looking for "Liquidation Balance". \n\nIf we didn\'t do step 1 it would mean that users could then have a negative balance. To avoid that, we transfer ownership of the positions to our system and then liquidate them, that way if the liquidation order can\'t be filled it would be a system loss, versus one user having a negative balance. \n\nDoes that clear things up?

Coinbase raising $75 million in venture capital is bullish news for 2015. The three primary investors are the New York Stock Exchange, USAA Bank, and Spanish banking group BBVA. This is the largest amount ever raised by a Bitcoin company and shows it\xe2\x80\x99s on the verge of mainstream adoption.\n\nLike all markets, Bitcoin has its bull and bear cycles. Thus far we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen a consistent pattern of breaking records on a bull run one year, followed by a bear trend the next. If we continue on this pattern then the tail end of 2015 may be another record breaker.\n\nLast week was turmoil for the price of Bitcoin. There are many that see this market crash as a good investment opportunity. Notice how the big banks and Wall Street are now officially invested in the Bitcoin economy\xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x9cblood on the streets\xe2\x80\x9d is a sure way to attract the big fish.\n\nIf the big players are investing in this space, it may be a possibility that they\xe2\x80\x99ve been securing large Bitcoin holdings as well. After all, even heavy selling pressure has its buyers on the other side of the order book. Money is usually made through buying in at the bottom of price dumps.\n\nIf we do hit another major bull run, this will be the catalyst for widespread adoption. There is a difference between using Bitcoin now verses in 2013. We have more infrastructure and clarity surrounding regulation. In my own personal experience, I can pay my bills directly with Bitcoin (Bylls.com) and cash in or out of my bank in 2 days. In 2013 I either had to send a bank wire or pay in cash at a coffee shop to buy Bitcoins (usually at a premium). Sometimes \xe2\x80\x9ccashing out\xe2\x80\x9d Bitcoin took weeks or even months to clear!\n\nOur last bull run attracted the attention of the mainstream investors, the next will already have the infrastructure in place for mainstream adoption.

He says:\n\n> If we are generous and assume the market needs $100 million in liquid Bitcoin every day with 10 million Bitcoin we have a minimum value of $10.\n\nFor the past year [the daily volume in USD](https://blockchain.info/charts/estimated-transaction-volume-usd?timespan=1year&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=) has been between $30 Million and $70 Million, with some spikes above $100m every once in a while.\n\nThe current market cap in USD is about $3.7 Billion.\n\nSo a market cap of $3.7b ($270 or so per coin) supports daily volume of $50m. The market cap here is about 74x the daily average.\n\nQuestions to ask now would be:\n* How much of that volume is speculative trading or weak investors likely go away?\n* How much of that volume is **unlikely** to go away?\n\nRE investors going away: To get the price to go much lower, we need a lot of people to stop trading/buying bitcoin. However, as the price goes lower it becomes a more attractive investment for people and there will be more incentive to buy/trade coins. So I'm not sure how strong the argument is that the speculators propping up the value of Bitcoin are going to leave and cause a big crash.\n\nThe authors $10 per coin price would relate to a daily volume of $1.8m. Is only $1.8m of the Bitcoin volume due to non-speculative uses? Not sure if there is research out there, but I'd guess that daily volume in gambling, online gaming, remittances, and other valid uses could be at least $1.8m now and should go much higher.\n\nSimilarly $10 would relate to a total market cap of $137m. If just one person (say the Winklevoss twins) wants to store $137m of their money in Bitcoin it would send the price and market cap higher.\n\nMy guess is that we couldn't possibly see a price lower than $100 per coin without there being a catastrophic blow to Bitcoin. Something that wouldn't just shakeout your grandma but the Winklevoss twins, the big miners, and all of the other high profile people with tons of money on the line in Bitcoin.\n\nWhat could that be? The major risk I see is if people decide to use an alt coin in place of Bitcoin. However it seems to me that the smart and powerful players in this space are already invested in Bitcoin and would have a lot to lose in the transition. It seems likely that Bitcoin will be used as a platform for any novel new technology or a hard fork would happen to help Bitcoin compete. Or...

But saying it is overvalued though in a manner that is to imply that bitcoin will head under $1 again and be worthless is silly.\n\nI think the most obvious answer is something that relates to miners. The market has basically seen standstill activity this year trade wise after such an insane year last year. However, miners are still producing supply and still needing to make a cut of profit to pay for their operations. The constant downward pressure from miners cashing out causes a negative feedback loop where they need to cash out more to continue to profit as prices go down, traders start selling cause prices go down, etc. Not to mention while bitcoin has had an excellent year as far as support/infrastructure, all of it is on the business/OTC deals side of thing. Best case scenario this doesn\'t impact market value at all on the exchanges (deals are not made on an exchange, but behind closed doors), worst case it adds to the sell pressure as companies that use/support BitPay just insta-sell them when they receive the coins, which are sold on an exchange.\n\nBitcoin\'s value goes up only when two things happen:\n\nA.

Essentially, a company uses income from advertising placed on members' screens to pay them for time spent surfing.\n\n>A PTS company would provide a small program to be installed on a member's computer. Advertisers' banner ads were then displayed while the member was browsing the web. Since the viewbar tracked websites that the user visited, the PTS company was able to deliver targeted ads for their advertisers. Advertisers paid the company a small amount (typically US$0.50) for every hour of a member's surfing.\n\n>Members were usually limited on the amount of time per month for which they would be paid to surf (typically 20 hours). However, PTS companies also paid their members for each new user referred to the company (typically US$0.05 - US$0.10 per recruit). Thus, it was profitable for a member to garner as many referrals as possible, encouraging some users to recruit members using [spam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spam_(electronic\\)), though officially forbidden by the user's agreement.

The word "trade" has multiple meanings, and is thrown around a lot, and I just want to clarify a few points that have come up. \n\n1. The bio information that was linked to is based on an old bio that was incorrectly written on the tether.to beta site. Phil was managing a fund that was invested in cryptocurrencies, but ceased day to day trading activities upon starting his role at Bitfinex, which roughly coincided with the fall of Mt Gox. \n2. The entire management team monitors our personal accounts, in order to prevent abuse, and we all act as checks and balances on each other. The idea that someone who works in Bitcoin shouldn\'t be able to own or adjust his position in bitcoin is silly. Bitcoin is not a publicly traded company, it is an asset. Any orders Phil may have placed would have been limit orders, and subject to the rest of the management teams monitoring.\nTo be very clear, Phil has not been actively trading since joining the team at Bitfinex. That being said, and given the volatility of bitcoin, it is necessary to adjust one\'s exposure. We spend a lot of time trying to build the best exchange, and we definitely do hold and are bullish on bitcoin. There is a difference between a "trade" in the sense of being a day trader or actively trading positions, and executing a limit order, which is basically a passive buy or a sell of the asset in question. \n\n3. We have become the number one USD exchange, specifically, because we have made it our top priority to provide a fair and even playing field. We engage with our clients and the community and try to be as transparent as possible. We hold ourselves, and each other to the highest ethical standards.\n\nBasically, we are very excited about the future of cryptocurrencies, and are honored that we can be a part of the core infrastructure. We are in it for the long haul, Bitfinex has been around for quite a while. We have consistently proven that we will not sell out our future for a quick buck now.': 36, 'Phil Potter has full access to bitfinex database.

I predict a gradual growth until the next major bubble. Looking at the 30 day chart (even the 6 month) helps keep these small bubbles, crashes in context. The tried and true method of buying and holding has been working. From a macro standpoint, bitcoin bubbles and then crashes to roughly half its peak price and then gradually grows/stays flat until the next bubble. I think trying to predict trends 1-2 weeks out is dangerous and the most successful technical analysis is done from a much larger step back than seems to be the norm here. It\'s taken balls of steel to weather each small crash, bubble since I bought in (for the 2nd time) early December around 600, but I\'m going to stick with it. I check bitstamp like a crackhead looking to get a fix, but I fight the urge to sell and force myself to play the long game.\n\n-----\n\n**Bottom post (-2)**\n\nLong term bull here because bitcoin is awesome, medium term bear at the moment though.\n\n-----\n\n**(+13)**\n\nI did most of my buying when Bitcoin cost around $300, so there is no way anything is going to look \'cheap\' to me this side of $200.\n\n[...]\n\nI believe that the price, being as high as it is, is one of these warts. I actually will benefit personally if Bitcoin rises, yet I do not think that is the best thing to happen right now, not if you are really interested in seeing the crypto-powered ecosystem arrive as soon as possible. The longer Bitcoin stays pumped up by fluff and hype, and has a faintly cult-like odor hanging around it, the longer it will take for serious businesses to make serious commitments to improving the underlying infrastructure, and implementing the kinds of things Bitcoin desperately needs before it can ever hope to take on credit card processors, banks, wire services, and so on.\n\nA high price, context aside, is itself a disincentive to commit to investing in anything Bitcoin related - especially so if it looks like the price is still floating well above the mean, and is still clearly at risk of a sudden 20 or 40% freefall at the whim of some press release in China. The high inflated price and the volatility that comes along with it also attracts exactly the wrong kind of crowd, the sort who want to act in ways that exacerbate that volatility rather than minimize it.\n\n-----\n\n**(+6)**\n\nI have a feeling this "breakout" wont last. What is surprising this time is that panic buying by small players was minimal. Breaking 940, there was some activity on other exchanges.

I think miners selling their coins to pay the power bill is a big part of why we're at where we're at.

Miners shutting down their gear to save power won't adversely affect the network.  Hashrate is arbitrary, as long as there's lots of miners out there, and there still are, the network will remain quite healthy.\n\nThe fact is though, speculating aside, Bitcoin is just as useful at $100 as it is at $1000.
