Being "backed" by something means that utility, either as a universally accepted and involatile store of value, or as redeemable utility guarantees the worth of the "backed" topic of discussion. The laws of physics that you say back Bitcoin are not redeemable for personal utility: Owning a Bitcoin doesn\'t let me turn that bitcoin back into physics. Oil, however, can be refined and used to derive a whole host of useful products, from gas to plastics; thus a bill representing one gallon of oil is said to be "backed" by oil because of the ability to redeem said bill for the oil itself. The bill retains value strictly because of the utility of the commodity that backs it. You can\'t redeem physics. Before the dollar became "un-backed" by gold, the trust in the dollar was derived from the belief that one could exchangea bill for a standard amount of gold.

Sorry for using "inflating", I meant it in the sense that the monetary space bitcoin occupies is still growing.\n\nPrice increases year-over-year have been all over the place:\n\n- 2011: 1620%\n- 2012: 287%\n- 2013: 6666% (assuming we end 2013 at $900)\n\n(All numbers Gox price, from bitcoincharts)\n\nAfter the stellar 2013, a "dull" year would be what I suspect - let\'s say we go into 2014 @ $900, then I can see the last leg of the current boom take us to 10x the start of the boom (at around $120-150). And here\'s why:\n\nThe April 2013 bubble started somewhere at $30-$40 and went to $266 - I believe it would have gone higher if Gox did not experience dDOS and technical problems. The 2011 bubble took off at $1.5 and crested at $30. So I think 8x-10x for a bubble is a useful rule of thumb with larger bubbles having a smaller multiplier. Based on that, the current bubble should pop somewhere between $1000 - $1600.\n\nAfter the 2011 bubble, price crashed to ~$10, then a bounce back to $25 and a slow erosion down to $3 (-90%). In April, down from $266 to $50 , back up to 160 and then over the next months down to $70 (-75%). My expectation would be a drop of 60-70%, so towards $600-$1100 from the $1000-$1600 peak.\n\nSo, in summer/fall of 2014 we would be entering a more steady growth starting at $600-1000 and maybe reach 200% in 2014 and a bit more after that - that\'s why I can believe we can reach $10,000 in 2-3 years **AT MAX**. After that at the latest we should see some competition and slower growth over the next 10 years till it reaches some kind of ceiling - hard to predict if it will be at $10k or $100k.': 5, 'I think we are going to see a slight downward trend for the next few hours.

To me it is more like the Linux kernel - open source, does not produce revenues but enables a whole new economic sector.

The reason why I am telling you all this is because I expected to pay several months up front, but now I don't, so I can buy BTC with it now, and just break off enough to pay rent each month as it comes. If we average a 20% gain each month, by the end of 6 months I could be living almost free! I know that's a gamble, but have you guys that are renting asked if you could pay each month in bitcoin?

We\'ve only risen about $200 (25%) since then, so if you think we\'re about to crash back down to 750 soon, you\'re basically saying "The United States legalizing Bitcoin entirely is not worth an increase in the valuation of a bitcoin." If you honestly believe that, please take a step back and reconsider.\n\nI\'ll admit: I\'m a rampant Bull at the moment. I haven\'t had much patience for the Bear point-of-view because I just don\'t see the logic behind it. I still think we\'re on track to $2000 and I don\'t see this thing fizzling out short of that.

We will test supports at 915 and 850 before we will start the ascent to break 1000 by this time next week. \n\nI think we\'ve seen the highs for this current short push that will test supports at the prices I mentioned above. It remain limited for this week but in preparation for a much stronger boom a few weeks from now. \n\nWe are seeing some interesting patterns on the 15m intervals that might be useful if anyone here has experience with fractals and Fibonacci-like patterns. \n\nIn April we learned that bitcoin\'s valuation is based upon what the users agree it to be. Read that again. It\'s the most important thing to understanding bitcoin. It could conceivably go to the moon in ways that we are now just beginning to come to terms with. The Virgin Galactic bit is so deliciously fitting :) But the real news here is so strong and in such a shift-of-paradigm tone for the technological and societal implications of bitcoin. \n\nGovernments, Silk Road, mass adoption, you\'re hearing it at an accelerating pace and the price is following that. This will also pave the way to the innovations that we haven\'t conceived of yet as the focus is mainly on speculation at this stage of the bitcoin technology. It\'s purpose at this time is to increase adoption into the root of societal affairs and it\'s financial and economic roots. Whoa wat?\n\nThe point here is that the inherent value of bitcoin is that it is a system that makes possible and incentivizes cooperation by all parties in a game theory sense. Bitcoin is not a zero sum market speculation game. Mass adoption of the technology, first through economic means and then by emergent societal innovations we haven\'t imagined yet, will benefit everyone who adopts bitcoin. You may also rightly call it the perfect ponzi-like scheme. This is a different beast entirely. \n\nWe also learned in April that if the infrastructure behind the adoption and spread of bitcoin lags behinds the exchange rate, crashes will occur. The more rapid the advance of the price, the more confidence is needed by the market. \n\nMy predictions of market prices now are based on the long term trend in the gox exchange rates (despite its withdrawal problems, MTGOX is still the most relevant exchange in terms of players who will most guide the price of bitcoin). \n\nI assume that the market is behaving according to the most beneficial conditions of its own growth, perpetuation, and adoption. "It\'s alive...." due to the mutualistic snowball effect I hinted at above. In order for bitcoin to grow at a steady rate that is also booming rewards for adopters, the exchange rates will reflect necessary corrections, testing of support levels, and strong patterns that instill confidence or fear within the market at the right times. \n\n\nTL:DR - to the moon!!! But only after we see a retracement of two support levels by the end of the weekend and then we will see 1000 this time next week. \n\nAfter this wall of text, my prediction better come true Q_Q\n\n\n\nEDIT- damn.

After I began seeing the buying pressure stay high into the 970\'s, that wall at 980 was getting chewed up. I\'ve never seen the market remain so calm yet strong after breaking an ATH. I guess the 800\'s support as well as all the good news tipped the scale upwards after yesterday\'s rally. \n\n\nUpdate 2- Looks like I was spot on with the 915 prediction.

If we do pass gold parity I would expect to see some precious metal investors start moving some of their funds into the market.\n\nThat said, if we don't keep this momentum up I would expect to see some stagnation, slippage, and ultimately a slow back slide, maybe into the $700 area before re-grouping.\n\nI've also been wondering lately about who exactly is doing the litecoin bitcoin arbitrage that seems to be going on across the exchanges that trade both btc and ltc.

This equality though is always really really tight, even during and right after large market moves, so I can only assume that people are taking advantage of this.  My only question is that given changes of even $0.50 in any of the prices can destroy any profit, how can this be profitable enough to try during big market moves?\n\nOn a final note, all yesterday/today I did my best to make informative posts and while I had great conversations with many people, I also felt like a significant number of you were trying to pull me into some sort of philosophical bitcoin circle jerk, or constantly try and delve into some pointless pedantry about definitions where I was using economic terms vs others using lay terms.

The exchange rate risk is carried by the trader. Bitfinex tries to makes sure the trader always has enough funds in his or her trading wallet to cover obligations in the event of a trading loss. If a trader ends up with more losses than his balance can cover, lenders can lose part of their lent funds, unless they use insured loans (see insurance loans section)."\n\nThis is the margin call thing that I mentioned above.

A margin buy allows you to buy more than you otherwise would.  In your example if the price goes up 50% in a year you only owe me 2% and would get to keep 48%.

Its sole purpose is to quickly confirm that certain public transactions of finite value are not double-spends.

You can't honestly say that the rise from $100 to $1200 was entirely caused by china and hype alone, and the reason why it will never crash is because of media atmosphere. No. The media and current market conditions are why we've been able to maintain a large price rise in the first place, and push it into 4 figures.

Now we have several relatively strong exchanges, we have China (as an anchor) and we're slowly pushing towards both political and commercial adoption. It's totally different from April in this respect. Even the media articles are becoming more favourable.  \n\nI also think psychological lessons were learnt from the April crash and I'm seeing a lot more 'buy and hold' strategies as people are starting to see Bitcoin as something that isn't going to go away any time soon. I remember sleepless nights during the April crash, frantically trying to refresh MtGox. When BTC dropped 50% a few days ago I literally just walked away knowing that it'd rebound within hours, days or weeks. ": 23, "Yes, exactly. \n\nSpeculation is not a dirty word.

Of course if sell happens right now people will start buying in. However crashes happen when there is an overall lack of confidence at a price point, and a lack of confidence in price recovery.  \n  \nPeople stop instantly starting to buy in when the price drop is signifigant or strong enough over the period of the week, because if they buy in too early they just throw away money. Once it hits a low point then a lot of people will buy in - this is whats known as entering a bull trap, which will see the value of BTC rise a significant amount before actually starting to fall (every bubble we\'ve had has had this on some level)\n  \nThat "real" fall is when people start changing their attitudes after the bull trap is done with.\n  \nThat said, there are a lot of people wanting to buy in to just hold this time around, so I don\'t think the price floor will be as low as it got in 2011 for example (where it went from $30 to $1) or even in april ($266 to $50). An "all time low" estimate for me would be the low point at $300-$400, but a more likely price floor in the $500-$600 range after the dust settles.  \n  \nOf course this is all speculation. Who knows bitcoin could be going vertical right now. I really, really doubt it thought. All the press and public interest is dying out in the short term, its still a very confusing concept to get into, its still hard to get into compared to going to a bank, etc. We go vertical when buying bitcoin is as easy and quick setting up a paypal account (but for bitcoin), when there are near 0% chances for exchanges to run out of reserve or have any real technical issues, when major retailers like ebay or amazon start accepting bitcoin, when ATM\'s can be seen at the very least in most major metropolitan centers, and when the concept is being so well distilled that its easy for a child to understand it.   \n  \nIn other words, Bitcoin needs to be in a place where the lay-man at least has heard of it, there has been constant exposure about it for a while, and the more informed layman and his/her family and friends can easily know where to go to jump into it at any point. So easy that it would be on par in difficulty to setting up an account for Twitter or Facebook, or at least open a bank account.  \n  \nIt will be an atmosphere where even short term bears don\'t stop buying in entirely because they know every $ in value BTC goes up, it has something backing it as to why. This is nothing like what is going on now, and BTC still isn\'t ready for that yet. Which is why I think this is still going to crash like every other bubble we\'ve had before. Hell a large number of buy+hold people on a thread posted here recently have said they\'ve stopped putting new money into the market in the sub $1k range, and the sentiment wherever I go seems to be the same. There are less and less people willing to put money into this price point now than ever during this run. This is why I\'m bearish. I\'d yield to the bulls if there were reason to truly go vertical right now, but as explained above I truly don\'t think the market is ready for that yet.  \n  \n(sorry for the tangent!)': 8, 'Nope.

I think now is a time to be very careful.\n\nBitcoin is no more useful than it was a week ago: in fact, perhaps it's become even less useful because even holding it right now incurs a tremendous amount of risk. We positively need utility in order to reach any stability at these prices. Moreover for the bitcoin project to become a success in it's own terms, in needs to useful in our day to day lives and that should be the overriding objective. There is a tremendous amount of work to do and some major technical questions to be resolved for the protocol before that happens. \n\nSo whilst it might have become fashionable, it certainly hasn't succeeded yet! \n\n..none the less. There is clearly lots of money to be made right now and we may well not be at the end of this growth spurt. April 2011 saw a 30x increase in value, this years bubbled was approximately 10x  ( depending on where you put the start). We might shoot past both and go completely parabolic for a while, but the point is we are entering what has historically been a very dangerous period of time. Any bad news or major technicals could send us back towards earth. Wherever this run up does end, i'm quite sure it will come quite a ways downwards with a big bump. \n\nWho's investing now? With gold parity achieved are we turning the heads of major international investors? I'm not sure. The scary and slightly wonderful thing about the last few weeks has been the perpetual positive feedback that breaking important boundaries creates: we are going to have to wait another 4-5 days before any cash  generated by this round reaches the market. \n\nThe rise of bitcoin in the east certainly lends some strength to the argument that perhaps we haven't even begun this run-up yet. As i write this, gox and btc china have reached parity around 1180: with the withdrawal issues people have been facing at gox, that probably puts the Chinese back in control. It will interesting to see if the news this morning regarding the telecom giant accepting BTC for a phone promotion is the reason or this is a late reaction to gold parity.

I mean, fact of the matter is, we've got really good news right now. The question I want answered then, is where do we end up? How do we take the most advantage of it?\n\nPersonally, I'm putting BTC in a target range of 2-3k. We're not really in bubble territory yet. Honestly, this rise from 800-1200 has felt, for lack of a better term, *normal.*\n\nBut once 2k and 3k hit, man, I think we're in for a bubble. We might even see as high as 5 or 6k at the absolute peak. (Suddenly, does that 10k prediction I've been talking about for March seem so far off?)\n\nLook at litecoin right now. *THAT* is a completely irrational bubble, but it shows how far things can go when irrational buyers hit the market. So far, we really haven't seen much irrationality from this market. We've got a lot of cool hands going long. We've had a couple of solid corrections along the way to shake out the weak hands and beef up the exchanges.\n\nWe've also had the holiday where so many people - I can guarantee, because I was one of them - were basically acting as bitcoin evangelists to their families.

I don't want to sound irrational, but I think we may be perfectly poised for the biggest bubble the bitcoin economy has ever seen.\n\nAnd we've hit 1230 as I wrap up writing this. Just 14 more bucks to go.\n\nEDIT: Gonna add my short term target in here of 1450.\n\nEDIT 2: Also add to this the fact that MtGox has no trading fees this Friday, and that, as others are reporting, China Telecom now accepts bitcoin as payment.\n\nEDIT 3: Okay, I think we need a Super-Bull flair options for moments like these. Or at least an Apollo spacecraft.\n\nEDIT 4: Flash crash on Gox down to 1175 because GOOOOOOOOOXXXXXX!!!!!! They lagged a bit and boom. \n\nEDIT 5: Forgot to look at the altcoin situation. That nonsense needs to pop, soon. I saw a flash crash and rebound in LTC early this past morning, from a high of around 50, down to 38 or 40 (IIRC), and then gradually recovering over the day. Bullish speculators still outnumber to panic sellers, but it's clear the hands are getting twitchy; everyone is waiting for the crash in that. I can't see it going much higher, even if BTC continues to grow. I just... I mean, there are bubbles, and then there is defying all reason. LTC is in the latter category right now.\n\nBelieve it or not, I think PPC is a safer alt right now. It should probably be closer to 1.50-2.00 but yeah, it's not ludicrous like LTC. Still, it might be brought down when LTC crashes.\n\nAnd the thing is, LTC crashing will increase the demand for BTC. People will want to exit LTC when it has the highest ratio to bitcoin, and I think that moment might be right now. This is the first night we're seeing in a while that the LTC price isn't increasing by leaps and bounds, but actually falling. Smart money seems to be moving back into BTC, before BTC shoots off and LTC can't keep up (because again, it would be ludicrous for it to keep pace), destroying that optimal LTC:BTC ratio.\n\nEDIT 6: Ugh, if Gox prematurely kicked off some kind of sell-off with its lag there, I might scream.\n\nEDIT 7: I don't consider gold parity to be truly broken yet. We barely touched it there (some claim we did at 1242 - but gold was 1244 and is now like, 1247 or something) for a moment before lag kicked in and dropped the price like a rock.

This is based on the market\'s interpretation of what the value is today, as well as a large element of "what the value COULD be".\n\nThe more market information that comes out, the more accurately we\'ll be able to value Bitcoin. Currently, there isn\'t much HARD DATA, and the valuation is probably made up of 10% value, and 90% potential. If you believe in it\'s potential, $1200USD/coin is an absolute bargain. If you don\'t believe in it\'s potential, then I invite you to sell your coins when it hits $2000USD/coin "before the crash", and to not bitch when it hits $20,000USD/coin when India and Africa are using bitcoins as currency through their smart-phones.': 1, "Growing logarithmically wouldn't be quite as fun.": 2, 'So, lets do a bit of actual analysis here.\n\nThe last exponential rally in April followed three phases:\n\nOne trendline on the order of 89.5 degrees, then a second push tracing along 89.8 degrees, and a final short-lived spike along the hair-line of 89.99 degrees.\n\nEven if you disagree how I actually measured these - look for yourself. There are three distinct phases of price acceleration. When we get super-exponential, its going to fall apart, no "ifs", "ands" or "buts" about it.\n\nThis is natural, and doesn\'t impair the long-term abilities of Bitcoin at all.\n\nAnother metric is to compute a parabolic curve using a starting point.

It echoes a slide one year ago when then yen tumbled 22% from late October 2012 to the end of April. As The Wall Street Journal reported earlier in February, that resulted in payouts of close to $1 billion for big-name investor George Soros.*\n\n*"I do think dollar-yen can be at 110, easily," said David Baran, co-chief executive officer of Tokyo-based hedge fund Symphony Financial Partners. Right now, it is approaching the year\'s highs at \xc2\xa5102 to the dollar.*\n\n*Further clarity on when the U.S. Federal Reserve might start trimming, or tapering, its monetary stimulus, could help the dollar climb further against the yen "sooner rather than later," Mr. Baran said.*\n\n*Mr. Baran started selling the yen and buying Japanese stocks coming into November last year and "kept rolling the position aggressively" through February. After taking the positions off by the spring end of Japan\'s fiscal year, he said he\'s back in both bets with a "reasonable size" position. Trading patterns look very similar to this time last year, he added.*\n\n*Paul Lambert, head of currencies at Insight Investment in London, which manages around $435 billion of assets, said he has held an underweight position in the yen relative to his benchmark for most of this year, and added to that negative bet on the yen this month. "The Bank of Japan has done a lot of easing but they will have to do a lot more easing. To maintain the momentum in growth is going to require further weakening of the yen and further stimulus," he said.*\n\n*This kind of trade worked well at the start of this year, providing one of the few strong trends that has helped currencies funds reap returns in 2013. Funds that specialize in currency trading had their best month in January in almost two years while the last yen slide was in full swing, according to the Parker Global Currency Managers Index, which tracks the performance of funds specializing in the asset class.*\n\n*But the trade suffered a sudden pullback in mid-May, when, after hitting the year\'s high of \xc2\xa5103.74, the dollar plunged rapidly, dipping under \xc2\xa594 by early June as the yen played its typical role as a safe retreat in times of market stress, shooting higher when the Fed first hinted at putting the brakes on its stimulus measures. By October, partly as a result of the stalled slide in the yen, Parker\'s data showed FX funds were down by 4% in 2013.*\n\n*Now, helping to fire the bet up again, concerns over Fed policy are generally calmer. Even as investors prepare for the beginning of the end of easy Fed policy, the yen isn\'t pushing higher based on market fear, and the yen is sliding anew on signs Japan\'s central bank may up the ante on its easy-money program, which is aimed at stoking inflation and boosting the Japanese economy.*\n\n*"You have a hyperactive Bank of Japan versus a tapering Fed," said Jacob Mitchell, deputy chief investment officer at Platinum Investment Management Ltd. in Sydney. "Certainly from a money supply perspective, things are moving toward a weaker yen," said Mr. Mitchell, who bets against the yen as a hedge to his positive bets on Japanese stocks.*\n\n*Some investors are also jumping back into Japanese stocks to benefit from the falling yen\xe2\x80\x94which benefits exports\xe2\x80\x94and cheap borrowing costs. Foreigners have scooped up about \xc2\xa52 trillion ($19.6 billion) in stocks since the middle of November, the largest two-week buying spree since mid-April. That\'s helped to drive the benchmark Nikkei 225 index up 9.8% this month, to its highest closing level on Thursday in nearly six years.*\n\n*Currencies investors have been burned repeatedly this year by market trends that have fizzled out or not materialized as expected. The persistent strength of the euro has outfoxed many investors, for example, while the yen\'s snap higher in late May hit the currency\'s sellers. So-called macro funds, which typically invest in global currencies and bonds, are up just 1.5% through October, according to Singapore-based industry tracker Eurekahedge.*\n\n*That means many are loath to miss out on the yen\'s new slide, even if some doubts remain around the sustainability of the dollar rally. A further rise in U.S. bond yields or a strong U.S. jobs reading next Friday\xe2\x80\x94which would strengthen the dollar\xe2\x80\x94would help ease those doubts, said Greg Matwejev, director of FX hedge fund sales at Newedge Group SA in Hong Kong.*\n\n*"We do need to see U.S. bond yields go back to 3% for this move to be serious," Mr. Matwejev said. The 10-year Treasury yield was at 2.7% Thursday.*\n\n*The fact that the yen has also weakened considerably may limit how much further it can fall, some investors say.*\n\n*Still, strategists say the economics are leaning toward a weaker yen. with U.S. developments encouraging and those in Japan mediocre at best. Minutes released this week from the Bank of Japan\'s late-October policy meeting indicated that three of its nine members were concerned about negative risks to the economy. Board member Sayuri Shirai on Wednesday said the central bank is open to taking further easing steps if economic growth stumbles and deflationary pressures return.*\n\n*"Just as seen last year, the urge to disengage during December would be a mistake," said Credit Suisse this week in a note to clients. The firm predicted the currency would fall as low as \xc2\xa5110 to the dollar in the next three months and \xc2\xa5120 over the next 12 months.*\n': 5, 'But then they are buying it right back up, or at least one of them is.

I strongly recommend not doing this (disclaimer I'm a tax accountant but only familiar with US Tax law).\n\nIn the US, if your company is organized as a C Corporation (as opposed to an S Corporation), you are effectively paying tax twice. When distributing BTC from the corporation to its owner, the corporation pays tax on the unrealized gain (if any) and the owner has a taxable dividend in the amount of the fair market value of the BTC in US dollars.\n\nI know this might not 100% apply to your situation but if the tax regimes are even remotely alike, it would be better to keep your bitcoinage separate between you and your company.\n\nDisclaimer #2: There has been no IRS guidance on how to tax Bitcoin, but the above scenario is consistent with the taxation of other foreign currencies.

Anyone selling more than \xc2\xa377k/yr in BTC is most probably unknowingly engaging in tax evasion (for VAT in addition to any applicable CGT).\n\nAnyway.. the point of all this is that bitcoin and UK companies don't really work - if you want to accept bitcoin as a UK company the only sensible way to do it is via an offshore BTC->GBP gateway such as bitpay.com - otherwise you'd have to charge 20% more for your goods/services in order to pay HMRC they're cut when you dispose of the BTC.

There are other ways to trade, and others may wish to offer their advice as well.\n\n**Start Small**\n\nTake 90% of your coins, put them in cold storage (don't leave them in an exchange or you will be tempted to trade with them).  Then daytrade with the other 10%.  In the beginning, you will loose a lot.  This way it will not hurt you too much.\n\n**Keep Score in Bitcoins**\n\nIt's a good idea is to count your trading capital in bitcoins - try to maximize the amount of bitcoins you have.  This is your score.  Over the years bitcoin will probably continue to grow in value, so if you maintain and grow your bitcoin amount, you will gain from this growth (the other way to trade would be to count your trading position in dollars, but then it's much harder to keep track of whether you are making more from trading than you would have from just holding the original coins).\n\n**Follow the Market**\n\nFollow the medium length trends that last for hours or a bit less.  Look at five minute to one hour [bars](http://www.oilngold.com/images/stories/contributors/todayfx/candlesticks-explained/0101.gif) on charts ([Clarkmoody](http://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/) is a good chart site to use).  Trying to trade too short swings is not worth it - there's much more noise there and you end up chasing too small trends to make enough profits to cover the trading fees.\n\nWhen you spot a consistent downtrend sell your coins.  When it starts to level off, buy the coins back (the one-minute bar view is good for spotting when the trend levels off).  If the price stops going down and starts to rise, buy the coins back immediately, even if it is at a loss.  Do not let a loss run.  At other times (and over nights) leave the funds in bitcoins, with zero fiat.  \n\nFollowing these rules requires mastering your emotions - don't hope that the price will come back down later if it went over your sell price, just close the position and accept the loss.\n\nThis way you should be able to increase your bitcoin amount over time.  When you get more confident, you can trade with a bit more of your total bitcoin funds.\n\n**See the Patterns**\n\nYou will learn to spot patterns in the price movement over time.  Some of the more common and easy to spot ones are [ascending](http://www.guerillastocktrading.com/ascending-triangle-pattern.gif) and [descending](http://www.guerillastocktrading.com/descending-triangle-pattern.gif) triangles, when the price is butting against a wall either above it (resistance to growth) or below it (support for the price) until it breaks through (in most cases) or is deflected (if the price movement is not strong enough).  \n\nOften the price will bounce or snap back quickly from dips or [rises](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blowofftop.asp) towards the average price.  It [oscillates on different frequencies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_wave_principle).

If you trade an altcoin you never know if the creator suddenly dumps half the existing coins on an exchange, or a bug is discovered sends the value of the coin plummeting.  Because of their low market caps they are also often targets of pump and dump schemes and heavy price manipulation.\n\nIt is possible to make money trading altcoins, but it is much riskier and less predictable, and few exchanges offer any as an option.\n\n(That said some altcoins have interesting experimental properties, I'm not trying to bash them all.
