When someone borrows liquidity from you they do not have the ability to withdraw those funds and when their position closes (the one that they opened on margin) the money is auto-returned back to the lender.  There is no trust needed.  In the case of dramatic price drop when position they opened is at a loss if the loss gets close to the point where the amount they have on deposit is equal to the loss the position is forced into a market order and the balance owed is returned to the lender.  In some cases you might not get 100% of the money back, but it is still what I would consider a relatively safe investment.\n\nThe only negative experience I have had with bitfinex was when we had the huge price run up to $900 from $300 and they lost liquidity on bitstamp which wreaked havoc on my orders.

Essentially they are giving traders 2:1 leverage in the form of high-interest BTC loans.  But where does the loaned BTC come from?  Are they borrowing BTC from within the exchange?

If so this alone could be reason enough for the Chinese government to step in a close them down.\n \nResearching this exchange and its owners lead me to an interesting comment from a Chinese news site [nbd.com.cn](http://www.nbd.com.cn/articles/2014-01-14/802986.html) (via Google Translate): \n\n"In response to the regulatory situation mutations at 16:00 on December 16, several large domestic Bitcoin trading platform held a conference call...Some operators are not optimistic about prospects in China bitcoins, partly by way of re-trading platform hopes to charge a fee in cash as soon as possible, that night, some of the trading platform will announce its pricing policy. But then, some platforms...changed back free of charge"\n\nBasically what this is saying is that in light of the announcements re: banning banks from dealing with bitcoin, and then 3rd party payment providers, the owners of several of the exchanges had a conference call.  During this call, they all agreed to begin charging trading fees, to prevent a mass exodus of funds with traders all withdrawing at once.  Well, we all know what happened, with BTC China and most others announcing they would implement fees, and Huobi defiantly continuing their no fee structure, and therefore capturing a massive amount of Chinese trading.  \n\n**TL;DR** \xe2\x80\x93 Huobi\'s margin trades could make this situation much worse than even this well thought out analysis predicts.  And if the above NBD China article is any indication of the owner\'s business ethic, Huobi traders (and frankly all of us) have reason to be concerned.

Well maybe, but I don\'t think it is realistic to assume that a successful and sophisticated trader capable of amassing those millions before bitcoin came on the scene, thus who would be quite capable of making money the old fashioned way without \'help\' from bitcoin, would deliberately take an approach that under typical market conditions, loses money as often as not. Running such a bot like that for just three hours would cost about $15,000 in purchases, assuming a tranquil market with no other interfering actors taking advatnage of your extremely predictable bot behavior, and would be making all purchases being made at the top (or if sells, sold at the bottom) of the spread - the least profitable place to do so and one which guarantees you will lose money if the market does not go much further in the direction you are trying to send it once you turn the bot off.  \n\n"Yeah but  maybe they knew it as going there and wanted to amplify the trend for their own gain" Still doesn\'t pencil out; if they knew the market was going to hit or at least come close to hitting target price X in the first place, why risk tying up (or even losing) all the money used to fund the bot when you could just wait for the market to approach the target price and strike  where it will be much more profitable?  \n\nAlso I\'d like to add that even if exchanges are running these bots themselves, it doesn\'t rule out people trying to copy this strategy or counteract it, but I believe this is an even less believable scenario because the counteracting bot always starts off with a big disadvantage, since it is not pushing forth its own profit strategy, but only blocking the other bot defensively, a bot which it has no way of knowing the strategy of leaving the defense bot open to being manipulated into awful losses unless its owner is hovering over it non stop... which largely defeats the point of having a bot.\n\ntl;dr  drip bots don\'t make economic sense for regular non-\'inside\' traders, so it\'s unlikely they are run by them.

It was extremely reluctant to follow in price and only did so after there was major movements from Mtgox. I was watching the markets real-time and China always had a very big lag time for sells, while any upward movement was eaten up almost immediately.\n\n3) During the sell off two days ago, we saw alot of bid support keeping the market from going into a panic sell.\n\n4) There has been a decreasing triangle wave forming since out peak at $1093Mtgox at the beginning of January. It is just now coming to formation, and as of 20 minutes ago (corresponding with this flurry of buying activity) we just broke upwards in a big way across most of the exchanges. I honestly was not expecting to happen this early, my guesses have been on the 20th or 21st it would have reached it's consolidation and broken out in a direction.

There is a chance that this is the beginning of it? Like I've said I've been expecting volatility coming in the next few days, but it seems the direction has initially indicated upward. The volume, bid support and buys seem to show it. We'll see how long Gox continues past the wave.\n\nDoes anyone have any contradicting input to my analysis?

Ok, so not gonna lie, this is a bit melodramatic in parts, but I\'m trying to have a little fun with an otherwise rather sobering prospect. Even if you don\'t agree,  I hope you enjoy reading and picking it apart :)\n\nLet\'s just say you own an exchange.  \n\nThis carries with it a number of obvious perks, as well as some not so obvious ones:\n\n**1. You alone know how much gunpowder is in the keg.**  \n\nSpecifically, you have sole access to one incalculably valuable bit of market data that no one else in the market is privy to, namely: you know the exact total amount held in, and the rate of flow of money into and out of, your customer\'s exchange accounts and wallets.  \n*You know how much money is waiting right on the edge of the market, but just out of sight of the rest of the Bitcoin universe.* \n\n1a. As a corollary you alone also know:\n\n* **how many accounts are habitually active traders vs relatively inactive,** and can even track their trade patterns - this would account for people who use their own trading systems rather than the website interface to place their orders as well as the fact that clients are in different time zones with different sleeping hours.  \n\n* **how many people are logged on to your site and the rate they are logging on and off** - giving you a good idea of how quickly the powder will burn - or explode - once lit. \n\n**2. You can freely move coin inside your own exchange without it being visible to the blockchain,** because you are just changing numbers in your own internal ledger, not literally recording transactions in the blockchain.  As long as there are no fees involved, which of course there aren\'t, you never even have to report this activity to tax authorities since trading 0.01 BTC to yourself and then later trading the same amount back to yourself produces no net gain or loss (interim valuation differences cancel out on the return trade) no matter what the dollar or euro or yen exchange value does in the meantime.    \n\n2a. Again, as corollary, since your coin moves are all off the blockchain, and are unaudited by any sort of official body (or anybody, period) you don\'t have anything stopping you from buying and selling your own coin, or just reporting that you are buying and selling it. Obviously you wouldn\'t pay any fees on these moves, and they would be reported to the API and therefore interpreted by all the charts as real activity.  It costs you nothing and risks you nothing as long as you are reasonably subtle about doing it. \n\nApplying these observations to the peculiar drip bot activity on a few exchanges, Gox mainly, explains their behavior in a much more plausible, if cynical way that I have seen mentioned before. I believe these bots are run by the exchange itself, not by outside traders.   \n\nI originally assumed the bots were run by long time traders or other \'whales\' like an institutional investor testing ideas out that are illegal on real exchanges. But the observing the bot behavior for a few days during all this quiet time doesn\'t seem to yield a strategy that makes sense much of the time if profit from trading is the objective.  I\'ll explain my reasoning a bit further in another comment after the end, but bear with me for now and read on here.\n\nInstead, I think the Exchange itself is running these bots.  The drip bot behavior makes much, much more sense when you put the exchange in control, than it would for any outside trader. \n\nExchange make money from trading fees, at least that\'s the main source of income for them.  Yes, I am sure some or all of them make a little money other ways but if they had a better source of cash than trading fees they could easily try to undercut each other try and drive out competition. Since they don\'t seem to be doing that in any serious way (a few temporary promotional sales don\'t really make a difference) I\'ll assume that figuring out ways to drive trade volume in slow periods and especially in situations like right now, where there is a deadlocked standoff happening between holders of fiat vs holders of coin.\n\nNo trade volume, no trade fees coming in, and it looks like we are dragging out sideways movement for possibly days or weeks while everyone holds their breath anticipating the big news.  Cash flow is looking pretty weak and you know if nothing happens, the market anxiety will start to manifest itself as withdrawal requests, especially for fiat which you are extremely undercapitalized on because you aren\'t regulated. You suddenly recall this morning\'s accounting briefing, where you zinged nerf golfballs off the desk of your COO, a \'joke\' he pretended to find as amusing as you did, sheepishly wincing in between the incoming missiles as he droned on in beancounter-ese. What was he saying now.. "last week .. shiftted away from positive net cashflow, maybe insignificant noise, but.  Uhm, uh yeah. sure. It might be nothing. A couple, a few, a couple few more withdrawals than we expected, blah blah, no, no, heh, no I didn\'t catch any playoff action".   \n\nYour big money printing machine of an exchange is in an frightfully perilous position right now, though no one on the outside knows it. The last couple times the market spiked and crashed you were able to ride it out because the total amount of money involved was a fraction of what it is today, and more significantly, most of it came from people who would be forced to mount any pursuit of lost funds from, shall we say, a uniquely disadvantaged legal position.\n\nThat\'s not the case any more. See, the biggest fish in your tank this time around have some very sharp teeth indeed. Their big time lawyers - big enough to have international offices and to conduct legal operations in your country of operation - will demand to be the first to be fed the moment they smell blood in the water. They will not listen to excuses. And they will not be brushed off. \n\nThe hapless peons with less than, say 50 BTC or equivalent fiat in your accounts, will have accept BTC withdrawals only, or else suck wind should even a handful of whale-scale account holders start demanding their money, which they will expect in full, in cash or cash equivalent, within 24 hours, instantly collapsing your business.  \n\nIt\'s safe to assume that the smallest traders - the ones holding a couple thousand dollars worth of coin with you - are to put it bluntly, fucked. Forget fiat withdrawals, they won\'t even be able to get a single Satoshi out of their account after the middling sized players have taken their bites. You feel a little bad for them but you quickly reframe the guilt as "weakness" and banish it from your conscience, muttering something about noobs who should have known the risks involved, a phrase you will find yourself compulsively kneading and massaging into a more palatable form over the next couple days. Most of them have no conceivable recourse and anyway, keeping your own ass out of prison and lifelong debt takes first priority.  Lookin\' out for \'Number One\' first!\n\nYour guys tell you that as the volume has dropped off, more and more money is being moved off the order books altogether or into remote positions that are unlikely to be filled in a flash crash. A lot of money out there doesn\'t want to get caught blindsided ... but also doesn\'t want to get too far from the action (i.e. cold storage) when it does come. \n\nThe total sum of this dark money across all accounts typically grows fastest in times of high uncertainty, slows down as support or resistance is approached, then finally flows back into booked orders and market trades when a clear trend develops or news hits.  But with neither a clear technical trend in play nor any consensus on the outcome of the news ahead, trade activity has hit a stalemate. \n\nThe longer this situation is allowed to exist, the worse everything gets. You are burning your already inadequate cash reserves, for god knows how long. And if the news is bad, the market may react with shock and spiral into conditions that your exchange cannot support, technically or financially or both. Good news you can manage, though it will be rough sailing. Bad news could be a disaster. And \'No news\' is itself, in the present high strung market accustomed to comically unsustainable gains, likely to be interpreted as bad news.\n\nSince you know exactly how much money is on the immediate sidelines of the market and how long it has been accumulating there - you know it\'s reached unusually high levels, so much so that it\'s starting to leak out the wrong way, in the form of account withdrawals - this tells you that pressure levels will not go higher than this.  People are itching to see something happen. If it doesn\'t the trickle of withdrawals, which will decrease volume even further, snowballing the situation into a cataclysm.\n\n*But alas, you have a solution.* Or at least, a stopgap.    \n\nA low key drip bot that will gradually, but relentlessly apply gentle price pressure higher or lower until it slips past resistance (or support) levels - either way is fine with you as long as the damn market comes back to life and the fees flow again. \n\nIt costs you literally nothing to run, it draws almost no suspicion apart from occasional curiosity. No sudden moves, no sudden turns, no gotcha reversals, and questionable profit strategy. From the outside, it just looks like someone with deep pockets is fooling around trying (and often failing) to make miniscule profits on miniscule spread trades, or toying with market psychology. \n\nFrom the inside, it looks like a stealthy way to force a catatonic market into breakout territory. \nA sneaky, slow-motion market defibrillator. \n\nedit:  tl;dr - drip bots are run not by traders, but by exchanges mimicking traders to steer the market out of stagnant (and unprofitable) conditions.

By increasing their public volume numbers.\n* 2. By making profitable commission free trades.\n* 3.

Wall Street has enacted law after law after law to try and curb thousands of now illegal methods to secretly take a cut of customers trading money, from Front Running, to Marking the Close, to Vol Pricing, etc, and the list goes on...\n\nThat is why Bitcoin is still just a place for money you are willing to lose, and is more like gambling than investing.

Pickles such as La 8th garlic, which turns green from vinegar, are also made on this day. For those that believe in Buddhism, the La 8th (\xe8\x87\x98\xe5\x85\xab) holiday is also considered Bodhi Day. L\xc3\xa0yu\xc3\xa8 (\xe8\x87\x98\xe6\x9c\x88) is a term often associated with Chinese New Year as it refers to the sacrifices held in honor of the gods in the twelfth lunar month, hence the cured meats of Chinese New Year are known as l\xc3\xa0r\xc3\xb2u (\xe8\x87\x98\xe8\x82\x89). The porridge was prepared by the women of the household at first light, with the first bowl offered to the family\'s ancestors and the household deities. Every member of the family was then served a bowl, with leftovers distributed to relatives and friends. It\'s still served as a special breakfast on this day in some Chinese homes. The concept of the \'La month\' is similar to Advent in Christianity. Many families eat vegan on Chinese New Year eve, the garlic and preserved meat are eaten on Chinese New Year day.\n\n>On the days immediately before the New Year celebration, Chinese families give their home a thorough cleaning. There is a Cantonese saying "Wash away the dirt on ninyabaat" (\xe5\xb9\xb4\xe5\xbb\xbf\xe5\x85\xab\xef\xbc\x8c\xe6\xb4\x97\xe9\x82\x8b\xe9\x81\xa2), but the practice is not restricted to nin\'ya\'baat (\xe5\xb9\xb4\xe5\xbb\xbf\xe5\x85\xab, the 28th day of month 12). It is believed the cleaning sweeps away the bad luck of the preceding year and makes their homes ready for good luck. Brooms and dust pans are put away on the first day so that the newly arrived good luck cannot be swept away. Some people give their homes, doors and window-frames a new coat of red paint; decorators and paper-hangers do a year-end rush of business prior to Chinese New Year. Homes are often decorated with paper cutouts of Chinese auspicious phrases and couplets. Purchasing new clothing and shoes also symbolize a new start. Any hair cuts need to be completed before the New Year, as cutting hair on New Year is considered bad luck due to the homonymic nature of the word "hair" (fa) and the word for "prosperity". Businesses are expected to pay off all the debts outstanding for the year before the new year eve, extending to debts of gratitude. Thus it is a common practice to send gifts and rice to close business associates, and extended family members.\n\n>In many households where Buddhism or Taoism is prevalent, home altars and statues are cleaned thoroughly, and altars that were adorned with decorations from the previous year are taken down and burned a week before the new year starts, to be replaced with new decorations. Taoists (and Buddhists to a lesser extent) will also "send gods" (\xe9\x80\x81\xe7\xa5\x9e, s\xc3\xb2ngsh\xc3\xa9n), an example would be burning a paper effigy of Zao Jun the Kitchen God, the recorder of family functions. This is done so that the Kitchen God can report to the Jade Emperor of the family household\'s transgressions and good deeds. Families often offer sweet foods (such as candy) in order to "bribe" the deities into reporting good things about the family.\n\n>Prior to the Reunion Dinner, a thanksgiving prayer offering to mark the safe passage of the previous year is held. Confucianists take the opportunity to remember the ancestors, and those who had lived before them are revered.\n\n>The biggest event of any Chinese New Year\'s Eve is the Reunion Dinner,named as "Nian Ye Fan".

High margin interest rates and huge spreads are sure to sink every boat except for maybe- MAYBE- boats that sail in only the most volatile markets.

The order doesn't ONLY sell 5 BTC at $800, it's meant to sell the whole position (assuming the stop-loss was set for the entire amount of the position).

Discussions of the Soviet Union \xe2\x80\x93 United States nuclear confrontation during the Cold War frequently used the term, specifically in reference to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. The key element that makes such situations Mexican standoffs is the very close equality in power among all involved. The inability for any one party to advance their position safely is a condition common to any standoff; in a Mexican standoff, there is additionally no safe way for any party to withdraw from their position, making the standoff effectively permanent.\n\n>In financial circles, the Mexican standoff is typically used to connote a situation where one side wants something, a concession of some sort, and is offering nothing of value. When the other side sees no value in agreeing to any changes, they refuse to negotiate. Although both sides may benefit from the change, neither side can agree to adequate compensation for agreeing to the change, and nothing is accomplished.\n\n>This expression came into usage during the last decade of the 19th century; the Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary makes an unattributed claim that the term is of Australian origin.

Matthews\n\nUpdated Dec. 20, 2013 6:58 p.m. ET\n\nFederal prosecutors in New York have expanded the criminal case against Silk Road, disclosing in an unsealed indictment new details about the global operations of the alleged online drug bazaar.\n\nProsecutors in Manhattan federal court on Friday unveiled charges against three additional men, who they said were arrested in Ireland, Australia, and Charles City, Va.\n\nIn October, the government arrested the alleged mastermind of Silk Road, Ross Ulbricht, and accused him of running the website as well as conspiring to have six people killed to stop them from becoming witnesses against him. There is no evidence any of the killings took place, prosecutors have said.\n\nProsecutors said Mr. Ulbricht was known online as "Dread Pirate Roberts," a reference to the 1980s romantic comedy "The Princess Bride."\n\nJoshua Dratel, Mr. Ulbricht\'s attorney, has previously said of his client that "the evidence will establish that he is not the person who the government says he is." Mr. Ulbricht hasn\'t entered any pleas to charges.\n\nSilk Road, where users could allegedly buy everything from narcotics to forged passports, was shut down after Mr. Ulbricht\'s arrest. But the case is a challenge to prosecutors who have to deal with technologies not yet fully addressed by the law. Silk Road allegedly dealt entirely in bitcoin, an Internet currency that allows buyers to remain secret.\n\nThe new defendants served as a small support staff for Mr. Ulbricht, and were responsible for monitoring user activity, "responding to customer service inquiries, and resolving disputes between buyers and vendors," according to the indictment.\n\nThe three men also allegedly conspired to distribute illegal drugs, including cocaine, LSD and methamphetamine, according to the indictment. They hacked into computers "for commercial advantage and private financial gain," prosecutors said.\n\nAndrew Michael Jones, also known as "Inigo," Gary Davis, known as "Libertas," and Peter Phillip Nash, known as "Samesamebutdifferent," among other aliases, allegedly performed backroom functions for Silk Road during its 21/2 years in operation, prosecutors said.\n\nMessrs. Jones and Davis worked as "site administrators," according to the indictment, while Mr. Nash worked as the "primary moderator on the Silk Road discussion forums." Messrs. Jones and Nash filed "weekly report[s]" with Mr. Ulbricht, while Mr. Jones would file "daily notes."\n\nSite administrators were paid $50,000 a year, and forum moderators received $75,000 a year, according to the indictment.\n\nMr. Davis, 25 years old, was arrested Thursday in Ireland, where he is a citizen, while Mr. Nash, 40, was arrested on Thursday in Brisbane, Australia, where he is a citizen, the Manhattan U.S. attorney\'s office said.\n\nIt wasn\'t immediately clear Friday whether any extradition proceedings had begun. Lawyers for the two men couldn\'t be immediately identified.\n\nMr. Jones, 24, was arrested in Virginia before being presented in federal court in Richmond on Friday. He consented to be transferred to federal court in New York, the U.S. attorney\'s office said. Attempts to reach Mr. Jones on Friday were unsuccessful.\n\nThe three men were each charged with three counts of conspiracy, one for conspiring to traffic narcotics, one for conspiring to hack computers and one for conspiring to launder money.\n\nMr. Ulbricht is currently being detained in New York. He is also under federal indictment in Maryland on related charges.\n\nHis lawyer declined to comment Friday on the new charges.': 1, "They're working on extradition to the US, sadly.  It's not just moderating the forum, they did administrative stuff as well (like find buyers for large orders and moderate disagreements between buyers and sellers) and received $$ for it--which is what could really fuck them, since at that point they're now working for a criminal enterprise and basically middle-manning drug deals.

The primary trend (of the overall market) is impossible to manipulate.\n\n2. "Averages discount everything" because the prices themselves factor in everything the trader knows, believes, feels and expects with the security.\n\n3. The Dow Theory is not an infallible guideline. (Funny - that\'s what technical analysis is prefaced with too!)\n\nThe first and third should be pretty self-explanatory: the former simply means that the market\'s overall sentiment is not broken by a small group of manipulative minds, and the latter simply means that every theory has to be taken with a grain of salt, and does fail from time to time.\n\nThe second hypothesis considers industry-wide averages, like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average. This is where many securities are factored into a single chart and their averaged value comes out as if it were its own security - which then lets us interpret it as we would any other currency or stock, with our indicators of volume and support and resistance and moving averages. The advantage to this is that it lets us get a one-stop look at the entire industry for which the index is for - a Health Points graph for that industry, for you gamer types. \n\n[Take a look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average](http://i.imgur.com/geOZ0No.png) for July 2008 to July 2009. Yep. That\'s why you turn to indexes when you\'re curious how an industry is doing - because instead of looking to see if a whole lot of stocks went down individually, you can just look there and see what the average is doing, and get the same sad picture. (But things are better now than they were, so let\'s not look at that picture anymore!)\n\nTherefore, "averages discount everything" meaning it just gives you the health of the industry. It is the state of affairs as they are at that point in time. Individual securities or currencies may be having their own issues or their own time to shine, but the industry average indicates exactly that: the entire industry.\n\nSo far I know of no index that would cover Bitcoin prices or anything close to it, so hypothesis 2 isn\'t very useful to us here. Hypothesis 3 is generally accepted by technical traders with regard to all their indicators anyway, which leaves us with the last bit of Dow Theory to consider: manipulation.\n\n# **Personal Concerns with Dow Theory and Bitcoin**\n\nOne of the main concerns I had when deciding whether or not to mention Dow Theory was the discussion of primary trend manipulation (the 2nd hypothesis).  Dow Theory relies on the general assumption that the trend of the overall market (Charles Dow\'s own "primary" trend) could not be manipulated. That is, the trend was a natural function of a free liquid market, and no one entity could have enough influence to completely buck the long-term trend. (He recognized that the "intermediate" and "minor" trends could potentially be manipulated, but not the primary market trend.)\n\nMy personal concern with this assumption in relation to Bitcoin is the question of the security itself being in its infancy. I have a slight concern that there is a very impractical and also unlikely - *but still possible* - vector for market-wide manipulation by those with vast amounts of other currencies. \n\nThe amount of Bitcoin and its users grows every day, but it is still young and is still being tested in the real world. This is true not just of its market viability (which it has been proving to be incredibly resilient thanks to the events over the last year); this is also true of its adoption. Its explosive price activity during times of renewed interest and widespread spikes of user adoption seems to buck that primary trend, and in an incredible fashion. In a sense, that is another possible vector of (positive) manipulation: where some affluent, altruistic benefactor would fund Bitcoin-accepting start-ups and Bitcoin-related services and put XBTs solidly back in financial news (and general news) headlines. Even though it\'s a positive motion for the currency and its adoption (and thereafter, its per-unit value), it is a manipulation nonetheless, and could happen. An entity or group of them could potentially create a bubble, and who knows if it\'ll break the primary trend of the market?\n\nAgain, this is simply a personal concern. The fundamentals of Dow Theory still hold as they have for over a hundred years, and Bitcoin still functions in the market as any other currency functions in a market. It has its trends, breakouts, weird periods of indecisiveness, and Dow Theory certainly has its place among the other technical trading approaches available to us. I hope this is a satisfactory response to having made this omission from last week\'s post.\n': 7, '[removed]': 0, "Time frames in markets have a fractal nature - meaning the same rules generally apply no matter what time period you're looking at.

But how do we handle when the price actually breaks those lines?\n\nKirkpatrick recommends the following "filters":\n\n* **Close Filter**\n\nOne way of verifying a breakout is simply watching for continued closing prices that break the support/resistance line. Issues with this are that one closing breakout might be a false alarm, or that waiting for multiple closes might cause you to miss an opportunity to change your position.\n\n* **Percent Filter**\n\nSet a percentage beyond the line in question that once the price reaches, can be called a breakout. The thinking here is that if your security reaches, for example, 3% beyond the line, it must have been a strong enough breakout that it won\'t likely return back to the previous trading range. This number can be "arbitrarily or empirically derived," according to Kirkpatrick, though he simply suggests that 3% is a common percentage to use relative to the price point at which the security crossed the line.\n\n* **Time**\n\nLook at time and consider how long the price has spent beyond the line. If the price has stayed outside a trading range for two or more bars in your chosen timeframe \n\n* **Volume**\n\nThere\'s that "volume" term again! Notice how helpful it is when the crowd supports a market action.\n\nIncreased volume during a breakout is a strong indicator that the breakout will be supported by traders, and therefore will establish a changed direction for the price.\n\n* **Volatility**\n\nThis one may be of great importance to a Bitcoin trader, as the other methods of confirming a breakout don\'t factor in the volatility of the security. Bitcoin, being greatly volatile in its history, can have incredible price changes without them being valid breakouts. To help determine the volatility of the trend, we can use (among many options*) indicators like the [Average True Range](http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/08/average-true-range.asp), or [Bollinger Bands](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:bollinger_bands). I won\'t have enough room to explain them eloquently here, but you can research how to use them using the links provided.\n\n*(Note that these confirmation methods focus on confirming breakouts after they have occurred, not predicting them beforehand, which brings us to the last section of this week\'s TAWR.)*\n\n**For those of you following along at home on page 259 of Kirkpatrick\'s Technical Analysis 2nd ed., you\'ll see mention of the "beta" method of determining trend volatility being "not useful in commodities because commodities have little useful correlation to the stock market or a commodity average." This is important to you as a Bitcoin trader because (as we\'ve seen through all of last year), the price of a Bitcoin is hardly tied to changes in market indices. So, don\'t use the beta method!*\n\n# **Criticisms and Problems**\n\nLag. This is the main problem associated with using support and resistance lines, and determining breakouts. \n\nThis post has only considered one leading indicator - the rest are lagging, and can only be used to confirm where a trend has existed, not necessarily where the trend will be in the future. This is important to consider because on its own, support and resistance trendlines leave something to be desired when you\'re in the trading environment and needing to know what to do with your money. **This is why we always use multiple indicators, giving us different perspectives to better understand the market\'s probable movements.**\n\nAnother point is that it\'s easy to try manipulating the data to better fit your lines - don\'t do this. **Your lines should follow the data, not the other way around.** Having the cart before the horse in this situation only dupes yourself into entering/exiting positions on unstable ground, and you wind up taking unnecessary risks with your money.\n\n# **Questions for You / Your Input for TAWR**\n\nSo /r/BitcoinMarkets!

Right now the flash rate is ~24 basis points a day.  That is 87% APR if the rate held (and you can easily get more than the flash rate with some patience).  Where else can you that kind of return?  I get a higher yield with Bitfinex in 30 days than I could in high yield junk bonds in a year.\n\nAs far as risk it is hard to gauge.  Supposedly the only time lenders would have taken a loss was in the April 2013 crash.  But Bitfinex made everyone whole.  I am confident they won't do that again if there is another flash crash.  But with more on margin another crash that causes a bunch of margin calls is going to drive the price down lower.\n\nI have noticed one thing that is making concerned.  The amount taken out on margin a week ago was 13 million USD.  It is currently 16 mil USD.  If there is 3 mil USD more on margin but the volumes are lower, where is this extra margin going?

Even for remittances it's expensive.\n\nAn expanding adoption and ecosystem would inevitably lead to reduced friction for money entering/exiting bitcoin. This 'problem' you state is at most a transient problem, and the largest part of the incurred fees are caused by the legacy banking system, and are not inherently linked to crypto. If anything, this would be an argument *for* crypto.\n\nTransactions themselves *are* quite cheap compared to existing electronic payment methods.

Deflation that is the result in a shift in aggregate demand/supply, deflation that results from the intentional shrinking of the monetary base by a central bank, and structural deflation.\n\nJapan\'s deflation was a mix of the first two, while Bitcoin\'s deflation is the latter. \n\nIn Japan an asset bubble in the late 1980\'s was getting out of hand. The BoJ raised rates in an effort to pop the bubble before it became unsustainable. Stock market crashed, and the government bailed out a lot of companies. By not allowing the market to clear itself naturally the result was a large number of zombie banks (just like we see in Europe today). I, and many other economists, feel that this was the real cause of the "lost decade" rather than the deflation that followed. However, for the average Japanese citizen, the effects of this lost decade were muted. Since prices were falling the average Japanese citizen was able to buy more with the same salary. In fact, a large part of the reduction While unemployment was high, it was still lower than what is seen in the US today. (if you dig into the statistics unemployment hasn\'t really improved in the last two years, people are just sick of looking for jobs that don\'t exist. check the participation rate)\n\nBitcoin on the other hand, is designed to deflate. Structural deflation was seen in most periods of economic prosperity before the central bank era. Increases in productivity allow workers to produce more goods in the same amount of time which, all else being equal, leads to lower prices. In this way productivity gains are passed on to the worker because his existing salary can buy more than it could previously. In inflationary environments productivity gains are kept by the holders of capital, as wages almost never keep up with inflation. \n\nIn the end, inflationary systems encourage conspicuous consumption and high levels of debt while deflationary systems incentive people to save there money and really think about purchases. Granted, the insanely high levels of debt in the global economy make an immediate switch to a deflationary currency impossible, as debtors would never be able to get out of debt. However, I think Satoshi knew this, and that is why bitcoin is inflationary for the beginning of its lifespan. \n\nAss far as why we went of the gold standard, that\'s a long discussion. Basically the US was trying to position itself as the number one super power after WWII. We established up the Bretton Woods System (a system of generally fixed exchange rates) to set up the dollar as the world reserve currency, by doing so giving the federal government and central bank significant control over the global economy. At this time the dollar was pegged to $35 equaling 1 ounce of gold. Because it was the only major currency that was pegged to gold in the late 60\'s, a large number of people were exchanging dollars for gold. This put pressure on the US in the form of a negative balance of payments, increased expenditures in the Vietnam war, and the possibility of a "bank run" as US gold reserves sank lower than dollars. Other countries were unwilling to prop up the dollar by devaluing there currencies and so left the bretton woods system  and the US essentially had to leave the gold standard or sell of all gold reserves to buy back dollars. \n\nCheck out this link for more.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_Shock\n\nDidn\'t end up being brief, but theses are complicated topics.

The first cryptocurrency to begin trading was Bitcoin in 2009. Since then, numerous cryptocurrencies have become available. Fundamentally, cryptocurrencies are specifications regarding the use of currency which seek to incorporate principles of cryptography to implement a distributed, decentralized and secure information economy. When comparing cryptocurrencies to fiat money, the most notable difference is in how no group or individual may accelerate, stunt or in any other way significantly abuse the production of money.

Having said that, backing a cryptocurrency with fiat, like backing it with anything, introduces an unnecessary complication and defeats the purpose of a real currency. Despite what some people apparently think, having a currency "backed" by something but then valuing it largely independently of that which backs it is nonsensical. A currency that is correctly regarded as such derives its value from how much people agree it is worth, nothing else. That goes for USD and yes, even gold, the value of which in reality has virtually nothing to do with its utility. (Why this confuses people so much I will never understand.

Some of them actually care about and are directly acting to further Bitcoin's long term potential (even if it is just spending their hard-won BTC buying GYFT cards or a subway sandwich or by setting up friends and relatives with paper wallets), but most just say they do because they have a vague idea that talking Bitcoin up will help the price rise and make them more money. \n\nNow, buried under all that fluff is an honest to goodness awesome technology and even more awesome new paradigm it implements.

I actually will benefit personally if Bitcoin rises, yet I do not think that is the best thing to happen right now, not if you are really interested in seeing the crypto-powered ecosystem arrive as soon as possible.  The longer Bitcoin stays pumped up by fluff and hype, and has a faintly cult-like odor hanging around it, the longer it will take for serious businesses to make serious commitments to improving the underlying infrastructure, and implementing the kinds of things Bitcoin desperately needs before it can ever hope to take on credit card processors, banks, wire services, and so on.  \n\nA high price, context aside, is itself a disincentive to commit to investing in anything Bitcoin related - especially so if it looks like the price is still floating well above the mean, and is still clearly at risk of a sudden 20 or 40% freefall at the whim of some press release in China.

It\'s as if people have simply forgotten what things were like then and what was posted on reddit then.  Or, they forgot what things were like in late 2011.\n\nLook at how similar mid-July was compared to now.  The most striking feature of both time periods is that there is a huge rush in innovation in bitcoin-related services, with lots of startups and new uses for the blockchain occurring.  In both periods, there was rapid merchant adoption, although back then the adoption was just beginning with a few franchises.\n\nThere have been three bubbles already, and each has followed exactly the same pattern: the bubble itself with lots of publicity, a crash, then a lot of new services and companies forming during the interval.\n\nI just don\'t see how there is anything at all different about this current cycle.  Instead of being negative, things are far better off than the last cycle: people are buying porn instead of illegal drugs, the number of vendors is increasing far faster than the last cycle, and the price held much higher at the low.  There is not a single area where fewer bitcoins are being spent than during the last cycle.\n\nMost importantly, the regulatory environment is far more positive than during the last cycle.  Before, there was vast uncertainty, whereas now we have most governments allowing people to use bitcoins.\n\nHow can people forget the bitcointalk forums at the end of 2011?  Are people trying to argue that things are somehow worse now, less than two months after the last downturn, where bitcoins didn\'t fall to 10% of their original value?

Every single piece of evidence has thus far supported the conclusions reached by many in 2011 that bitcoins will become the world currency and will be worth a fortune.\n\nPeople like to make fun of those who buy during bubbles for the idea that "this one will be different."  Now, we have people who are sprouting up saying that "this stability period will be different."\n\nIn order for the boom and bust cycle to be stopped, there has to be some event that indicates that things are different now.  If someone can point out anything that is worse than in late 2011, or in July, then perhaps they can convince me that the growth has stopped.

We are on incredibly thin ice at present, there is no way on earth that the China situation has played out in full.  I don't think it helps that many downvoters in the sub have not one clue on how to reasonably assess the current market, instead defaulting to idealistic valuation based on pure theorem.\n\nWe've had stability of price only because that has essentially been decided for us for now.  Whilst many fail or refuse to see it, we've suffered a month of unquestionable manipulation and profit taking at the hands of the few.  Whomever has been at this isn't done yet.  I strongly suspect the large buys seen today were intended only to incite a rally, but with poor volume across the exchanges this was ultimately a failure (of sorts).  If Huobi's volume is genuine, why did China not bite when the buying started at 07:00 (+8 GMT) this morning?

If this sell off does come as I suspect, it's difficult to gage the magnitude, or indeed the degree to which it will recover.  It feels like we're in need of a correction, so in this regard the China situation isn't necessarily a negative.  Strong prospect remains for bitcoin moving into the 2nd quarter of the year, and enough money is waiting to buy in at a low.  We could theoretically see some next level volatility in the coming weeks, or a moderate stabilsation into sideways movement at new (lower) value.

Fortunes of course come in smaller denominations, how many dollar\'s are worth a fortune?

The first is the medium of exchange currency is widely accepted by society as a whole medium for the exchange of commodities. Monetary developments in the history of thousands of years, once the physical currency, the final form of physical currency is gold and silver. Like Marx said natural gold is money. The most essential characteristic of money is a medium of exchange and measure of value. Itself to be valuable, so it can be denominated. Since gold production is limited, it can not meet the growing social and economic development, so the gold standard collapsed. From the later seventies of last century, the world monetary credit system completely behind monetary credit system is a powerful force of national credit and forced the country, so we put the national currency, credit currency called legal tender.\n\nWe take a look at Bitcoin, Bitcoin is not having the characteristics of these currencies? As far as I know, the vast majority of countries do not recognize the Bitcoin currency status. Currency in circulation in addition to the media, the value of scale functions, there is a very important function is denominated instruments. Bitcoin itself is not denominated in the currency, nor as the quote currency is possible. Plunged wild speculation "currency" can be used as currency it?

The higher lows leading up to the stage (shown by the trend lines) display a flat-topped triangle which would indicate a bullsish breakout in a few hours time. Lower volume during the ascending triangle pattern also confirms this.\n\nAlso of note, [there is a huge ~~sell~~ buy wall at $840](http://i.imgur.com/ihDftcw.png) (BTC-E) with relatively little resistance to price increasing. This is also confirmation that the price is unlikely to go down soon.\n\nIn terms of other TIs, StochRSI is showing overbought and the MACD line is just crossing below the signal line (increasing downward momentum), both of which indicate a bearish move over the next few hours. Annoyingly, this is contradictory to what I have just been discussing.\n\nConclusion: I am staying in BTC until a breakout occurs. I am expecting the breakout to be bullish; a break through the resistance zone (as shown) along with increased volume would confirm this. In my experience, chart patterns/trendlines have been more accurate for predicting a price change than technical indicators such as MACD/StochRSI have been. \n\nAs usual I could be completely wrong; I'm not offering advice I am merely documenting my thoughts so I can attempt to trade rationally. :) Have a good day!

I really like the idea of decentralized autonomous corporations, but we'll see where that goes. \n\nAs for Colored Coins and Mastercoins, I'm having a hard time getting excited about them. Colored Coins reminds me of the 'red list' pitch where some authority would taint certain coins which were once owned by nefarious people. I see now that it's not the same, but even then, I don't like the idea of making any one coin more valuable than another, and also don't understand how you would spend a Bitcoin that was backed by gold, without also sending the gold. I'll have to keep reading.": 1, '[removed]': -1, 'Makes sense. Thanks': 1, 'I largely agree with that, but my question remains. The idea is that a unit of bitcoin, whatever the size (eg, a satoshi) would represent, say, a share in a company, and would have its price determined by the market (ie, on an exchange aside from that where BTC is traded as a currency). What effect do you think that would have on bitcoin the currency?': 1, "That makes a little more sense because there's a central authority behind gold-backed currencies which maintain gold supply.\n\nFTA:\n\n>For example, let's say you own some gold at your house. You could hypothetically take 5 satoshis (0.00000005 BTC) and say that each one of those satoshis is equal to one gram of the gold that you hold in your home. You could then exchange those 5 satoshis backed by one gram of gold each on the decentralized exchange in the Chromawallet. This means that you could instantly exchange gold to bitcoins, dollars, euros, or any other user currency that is created in the Chromawallet. \n\nI don't understand how a person will be able to infuse the value of his gold into 5 satoshis on a whim, and then spend said 'Goldcoins' online. He still has his gold. Of somebody buys his satoshis and wishes to redeem them for their physical gold, then what?": 1, "I think a more likely use of Bitcoin is to facilitate decentralized exchange of assets that are ephemeral to begin with, like shares of stock, futures contracts, and the like. A satoshi could carry all the necessary information to legally establish ownership of real estate. It could work for any asset, really, so long as the law recognizes the contracts as binding, and ensures consequences for fraud or any breach. I suppose the libertarian and anarchist factions of the Bitcoin community don't like the sound of that, but communities everywhere inevitably have governments for good reason - business would be too risky without them.": 2, "That's my main concern about bitcoin too, but it's a long way off. While bitcoin is technically manipulatable at any time, I'm doubtful that the structure won't become large enough to reach a consensus, shutting the coin down with gridlock. \n\nHowever, i think you need to recognize that the causality is reversed. These altcoins are built off a bitcoin structure, and bitcoin is by far the dominant architecture, so altcoin prices are reactions to bitcoin performance, not vice versa. That's not to say the causality won't reverse, but it's a long way off. \n\nDogecoin is a good example. I thought it was BS at first, but it actually fills a very interesting currency niche that we didn't even know was empty (like ipads with tablets). Check out dogecoin's funding of the jamaican bobsled team. I don't particularly like the currency but plenty of people do. It is still reactionary to BTC.

The good news is that a solution for this problem has recently been found. In addition to issuing a currency, an issuer can also store collateral for the users of his or her currency in the form of bitcoins. For example, if there was a currency that was backed by one ounce of gold, then the issuer of that currency could send an ounce of gold\'s worth of bitcoins into an escrow account and agree to distribute those bitcoins to the holders of that particular currency in a situation where there is a "run on the bank".': 2}, ('If I believe Bitcoin price is coming down should I invest another crypto currency or just sell for dollars?', 0): {"i'm still skeptical of doge though, if BTC has a significant drop.

If you don't deliver, I don't have to sue you.\n\nGiven that, I can engage in high-risk transactions that I would never have thought possible before.  I can buy services from anonymous people who I will never meet without needing to care about feedback ratings anymore.  The network checks whether the postal service delivered a package with certain parameters to my house.  If not, you don't get paid, which removes an entire class of actions from arbitration.  I can sell intellectual property; if the domain containing the property isn't under your control, I don't get paid.\n\nI can also prove that something exists at a particular point in time. For example, if someone crashes into my car on a certain date, I can take a picture of the car with the day's newspaper in the foreground, and send 0.00000001 bitcoins to the address computed from that picture immediately thereafter. Now, if the at-fault driver claims that the damage was actually caused in a later accident, there is irrefutable evidence that the accident occurred between the time the newspaper was published and the time the bitcoin transaction occurred.\n\nIt is inevitable that soon enough, people will be wearing Google Glass or some successor everywhere they go, recording everything they do.  At the end of the day, the glasses can compute the hash of the day's video and send change to the address associated with the hash.  The next day, when someone claims that they weren't at that dinner last night where you saw them, you play back the video and show that person the hash to call them on their deceit.\n\nYou can take that further and require that in order for me to obtain employment with your company, I must not drink alcohol.  When an agreed algorithm detects my face holding an alcoholic beverage in any posted picture or public surveillance footage, I get fined $50,000 automatically.  Whether you like this or not is irrelevant to whether bitcoins have value.\n\nFinally, I can also prove that I am who I say I am, by signing my forum posts with my private key. Shortly, there will be no need for blog sites to require you to enter capchas or login using facebook. All they need to do is require you to pay 0.00000001 BTC to make a post. Any normal human simply couldn't write enough posts to spend more than a penny per year, but spammers would go out of business with millions in bills.\n\nBitcoins have their greatest promise in punishing fraudsters, liars, and scammers.  Mountains of paperwork and litigation are going to evaporate and resources will be redirected at more productive activities.
