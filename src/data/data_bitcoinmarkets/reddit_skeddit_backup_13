Example learning range: .1 BTC (lose) - .2 BTC (win)\n* Make your first deposit equal to the midway of your range (.15 BTC)\n* Follow strict Entry/Exit point and TA strategies until you win or lose.\n* If you lose (dip to or below your losing target), re-deposit enough to get back to your mid point.  Expect to lose 2-10 rounds before you ever withdraw any winnings, consider this the price of education, in fact consider it imperative to your education.\n* After each lose, evaluate how well you adhered to your strategies.  If you strayed, work on sticking to them closer during your next round.  If you stayed true, think about tweaking them before your next round.\n* If you win (reach or exceed your winning target), withdraw enough to get you back to your mid point.\n* When you start winning rounds about as much as you are losing then and you have gone over 20 rounds, you *might* be ready to increase your trading range\n\nMy Entry/Exit point strategy advice:\n\n* Do not open a position without also defining your stop lose and take profit levels\n* Keep a log of all positions\n* Never open positions using 100% of your trade balance, start with 20-50% and add to your position during pullbacks if things are going your way.\n* Consider exiting your position in the same manner, not all at once\n* Use limit orders 90% of the time, also keep the type of order (market/limit/trigger/etc...) in your log\n* Avoid entering new positions after a big lose OR a big win\n\nMy TA strategy advice:\n\n* Learning horizontal support/resistance is the most important charting item.  It\'s also the simplest: just look recent highs and lows and watch the market react when it approaches them.\n* Learn market conditions.  Learn what trending and ranging markets look like, most TA indicators work better in one or another.  Additionally learn to identify market conditions that are best to avoid.  ~50% of the time you should simply not trade.\n': 4, 'Currencies don\'t have market caps.

Behavioral finance 101.": 1, "Resilience is one of the most important factors in trading success. It is your ability to take the pain and prevail in the face of a seemingly insurmountable challenge. Learning to trade is like a series of boxing matches against the market. You get in the ring and take a savage beating. The next day you come back and take another beating and another the day after.\n\nWhat separates those who succeed from those who fail is the ability to take the beatings while improving every day, even if it is just a little bit. Carol Dweck has written an interesting book called *Mindset* where she discusses the difference between *fixed* and *growth* mindset. The essence of this concept is this: People with a fixed mindset are happy with what they have while those with a growth mindset are always looking to improve. All of the most successful athletes, artists, scientists or professionals fall in the latter category. This is one thing that will greatly help you if you are truly looking to become a trader. \n\nIf you improve every day and if you can do so without losing your motivation, you have a chance. Eventually you will get to the point, where you begin to understand the market's moves and feints and you won't take a beating every day anymore. You won't be able to win yet, but you also won't be consistently losing money either. If you can get to this point, you are maybe 2/3 there and can probably become consistently profitable. And if you are able to consistently make $100 each day, you can make 200 and if you can make 200, you can make 300 and so forth. But as I have said, the road is a difficult one and more than once will it seem like you cannot do it. Even professionals with decades of experience who already have made millions experience days where they feel like they cannot make money anymore. These are the moment when you need the will to still go on, to continue improving until you succeed and most people will eventually give up. But if you have the necessary resilience and the right mindset, you might just have a chance.\n\nYou still need to know what to learn and there are a lot of fake gurus, get-rich-quick schemes and outright scams, so be warned. Everyone who promises you an easy way to become a successful trader is either naive or a liar. But the people I have given you are the real deal. If you learn from them, you should quickly become able to tell apart the frauds from those who are real. Good luck.": 3, 'In terms of market theory, weak hands are people who allow themselves to be trapped in poor positions, like those who buy at market tops during the first stages of a bear market. Most of them will eventually sell at a loss throughout the bear market, eventually resulting in a climactic selloff. This transfers large amounts of stock to strong hands, who will later sell to future weak hands at higher prices. \n\nCall it weak hands versus strong, smart versus dumb money, professionals versus Joe Public, but this dichotomy is well represented in the price action of larger market cycles. Successful trading is highly dependent on being in sync with these cycles.

Currently there are 3,600 BTC mined per day which at present amounts to $864,000 in gross profits a day.  The other portion of a miner's revenue is fees which amount to a mere 15-20 bitcoin per day or roughly $4,000-$5,000.  So we have subsidy which is over 99.5% and transactional fees which are < 0.5%.\n\nAs everyone knows the subsidy halves every 4 years meaning most of a miner's income is quickly disappearing.  Many bitcoiners will say that transactional fees will take over.  However, a quick look at the [2 year transaction fee USD chart] (https://blockchain.info/charts/transaction-fees-usd?timespan=2year&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=) reveals that the amount of income a miner earns via fees has not gone up at all in 2 years.  This is all despite transactions per day increasing at roughly 50% per year.  From this we can deduce that most of the current transactions on the network are low quality/spammy and are unwilling to pay to use the network.  If someone has a better explanation for a 50% yearly increase in transactions and a 0% increase in fees I would love to hear it.\n\nWith some quick napkin math, if we assume it's acceptable for bitcoin to lose 50% of its current hash rate and still remain secure, that would mean transactions per day would have to go up by orders of magnitude.  In fact, if we take away the subsidy, bitcoin transactions per day will have to rise 10,000% to keep a mere half of today's hash rate alive and mining.  Of course we can get that number down by increasing fees, and there will of course be some subsidy left for another 10-20 years.  But still, transactions or fees have to increase many times the current rate in order to support even half of today's hashing power.\n\nTwo things are clear: this is not even remotely sustainable.

Everything else is determined by that. ": 4, '>Yeah, well, that\'s just like... your opinion, man.\n\nHaha correct, it\'s just my opinion.  But my opinion is also based on research and my own first hand knowledge/observations.  When people are talking about a "safe haven" asset, they aren\'t talking about Bitcoin.  Safe Haven\'s are the most trusted of trusted asset classes.  People seek out safe havens to shield their capital from loss.  They\'re not looking for returns in a safe haven asset, hell they\'re even willing to lose a small amount if they know they can limit the real downside (See: negative yield government bonds).\n\n>Bitcoin does represent a "safe haven" in that it has a guaranteed-to-be-finite supply that won\'t be hyperinflated out from underneath you (much like gold).\n\nWell, yes, but that\'s not exactly what people are concerned about when they are seeking a safe haven.  Not institutions, at least.  The "safe haven" assets they move to are US treasuries, hard assets with constant demands and relatively fixed supplys (Timber, Farmland anyone?), specific carry-trade currencies (JPY), and the blue chips of the blue chips.\n\nAnother difference in our thinking is that you\'re looking at a longer time line than I am.  Safe Haven assets are temporary investments.  People just want to weather the storm and not lose half their capital.  But once the storm has passed, the safe havens are cast off in search of higher yields/returns.  The effect of Bitcoin being seen as a "safe haven" would be temporary anyway.  \n\n>the only mistake that I believe you\'re making is ruling out the possibility altogether.\n\nWell, you\'ve got me there.  I don\'t want to sound like I\'m ruling it out entirely, because anything can happen (and usually does).  I just find it highly unlikely based on my own experience and knowledge.

I'd like to add one thought about why the current transaction fee system is not enough.\n\nAlthough the current transaction fee system gives us the ability to adapt to high volume, it is not adaptive enough to respond to spikes in activity *in a timely manner*.  If I offer .0001 bitcoin as my transaction fee during high volume, and others have beaten my price without my knowledge, there is no feedback other than my transaction not being verified.  \n\nIf, when I submitted a transaction, my client knew that blocks are full or near full, and if the going rate was tracked, I would have the opportunity to beat the best price.  This could allow price adaptation fast enough to make frivolous (or malicious) transactions undesirable by economic forces alone.  \n\nUntil it becomes easier to use the current transaction fees to deter frivolous transactions, the effect of a spike will still be a denial of service to ordinary users.\n\nI have no opinions about the stress testing.": 3, "Yeah, it's been 10 hours.": 1, "I hope you're right.": 0, "Maybe, but in every instance bitfinex has paid back users in full.

We have seen real money on the buy side especially on BFX with those bidwalls which have turned out to be willing buyers. The ETN volume has been solid lately.

Are there actually more buyers than sellers out there now?\n\nIf the bull's balls are strong enough here, we can shake off the bad news in the next few days - the stress test, the block size debate, Chinese stock market tumble, a likely Greek compromise.

That there is a difference between "real demand" and "spam". You can\'t really use the word "demand" in that context, on a TX-level, because there is no way for a machine, for the bitcoin algorithm, to measure "demand". On the protocol level, there is no such thing as "demand" in that context. There are only valid and invalid transactions, and every valid transaction is "demand". If I post the link to 2 TX on the blockchain, nobody could tell me which was sent to buy a coffee and which was sent to full up blocks.\n\nThere are some people who have a very strong opinion against this test, and others are in favor of it and per extension (imho) in favor of a truly neutral and open network.\n\nI tell you why I feel strongly about it: If bitcoin should ever get big enough to get real enemies, the fact that you can clog up the network for a few pennies is **incredibly dangerous**! As in, everything **I, personally**, have invested in bitcoin is in danger of becoming fairydust. This test is possibly more important than I\'ve given it credit yesterday, the problem that this whole thing is as brittle as it is HAS to be fixed before bitcoin gets big! It **has** to! If this stress test thing gives some wake-up calls in that regard, I\'m all for it.\n\nThe big thing about bitcoin is that everyone can use it, it is entirely neutral on the protocol level, and it is open. Those 3 things are very important cournerstones of this whole bitcoin thing. They are what makes bitcoin different from existing technologies in the first place. Simply denying somebody the right to use the blockchain because of their intention is impossible, there **has** to be something done about this **in** the code! This test is propably not malicious, it might even be <tinfoil> some big group or company testing the blockchain to evaluate bigger usage by them </tinfoil>. But the fact is there absolutely **can** be a malicious attack on the network in the future, for as little as 20 BTC for 100 blocks, or 32 hours. This is **INSANE**.\n\nThere propably has to be 10x-100x more fees IN ADDITION to a block size increase in order to bring the network availability up to par and at least make it less cheap to DDoS this whole thing. That would mean it would cost 80x-800x more to clog the network, and this is, as I see it at the moment, the only way to deal with spam on the protocol level. Anything other or at least close to that is at risk of a DDoS just like the one we will propably see tomorrow. For everything else, there is off-chain, and in the future, lightning, side-chains etc.\n': 12, "My short was in profit before they went down.

For instance, the famous DanV exclusively looks at the charts for "Elliot Waves", which is a valid theory often, but it is forever completely oblivious of something fundamental (more fundamental than Greece IMHO) like the halving. TA is circlekjerky, you are right, but that\'s precisely why it works; I mean, if I know that the crossing of the daily EMA always leads to a rally, I will buy when I see one. And the trader next to me knows that other traders are going to buy the crossing so he buys too, etc.\n\nAnyways, regarding Greece, I think the outcome is irrelevant. The importance of this crisis is not Greeks buying Bitcoins: the importance is the growing global awareness of the dangers in the structure of the global banking system, and the resulting vulnerability of people\'s ability to control their own wealth. \n\nSo, no matter the outcome, shadows of doubt over the system are being cast increasingly. And that is good for Bitcoin, because it was designed as an alternative to the intrinsic flaws of what we currently have.

If they control BTC, they have the patience and power not only to handle the smelliest of bears, but also to make BTC really mainstream by mobilising their media influence, governments, investment, commerce etc. around the world.

Now, a good proportion of those people are radically-minded "fuck the system" types.  \n\nBut if bitcoin blows up, and grows to the point where 200 MILLION people are keeping BTC, then of course the percentage of radicals is going to drop.  But the overall number is going to increase a lot. \n\nAnd the other thing to remember is this:  Even if the main use case for bitcoin in the future is just some commercial crap that goes against the ideals it was birthed with....the nature of the blockchain and the technology means that it can still be used by anyone in any way they want, as long as their use case fits in with the way it is coded.

They say that Bitcoin is going to be an unprecedented transfer of wealth. And I agree, but if GS is a huge investor here, then the transfer of wealth is going to be from the late comers to GS...\n\nIndeed, even I am making them a bit richer, because I bought bitcoins today, and they bought them at 220.

If it is hard to get euro's out an exchange, the price will be higher than elsewhere. If it is hard to get euro's in an exchange, the opposite applies.\n\nAdditionally, i disagree with your conclusion that bitcoin in greece is cheaper than in the rest of europe. First, there is no reason why 'the rest of europe' can't buy at bitcoingreece.com, and vice versa (ignoring the current capital control shenanigans of the past week). Second, the volume at bitcoin.de is quite low, it would be more significant to quote BTC-e or kraken's price.

Which would reduce the supply of euros on-exchange (that is if we assume that "the rest of europe" was ever a significant contribution to their volume to begin with) and bring the bitcoin price down for lack of buyers.': 1, 'all correct. my point is that it\'s interesting that "rest of europe" seems to buy more bitcoin than greece, otherwise bitcoin.de prices would not be higher than btcgreece.com prices but considerably lower.\n\nJust an interesting observation, and at least a disproof of the theory that greek people are running after bitcoin more than others. It\'s at least as much speculators in the rest of the world that are buying bitcoins.\n\nbtw, the reason Mt Gox prices where higher before the collapse in spring 2014 was because it was impossible or almost impossible at that time to get fiat money out of Mt.Gox. This drove prices up at MtGox exchange - everybody was buying BTC there, but almost no-one was selling there to get USD out of it. The same does NOT happen now at btcgreece.com, and this is exactly what is interesting and noteworthy in the current situation, and certainly surprising for everybody following the theory that "greeks run for bitcoins now".': 3, 'Yes, it\'s impossible to understand.\n\nThere\'s a buyer for every seller. The question is "at what price?"\n\nIt\'s clear that the sellers were not willing to sell at previous pricing, but not that there were more buyers than sellers which is absolutely never true.': 1, '>Well they\'re only allowed to withdraw 60euro a day so I don\'t see how you would be allowed to transfer more than that between accounts.\n\nThat\'s because very obviously you don\'t understand the legacy (fiat) money system (no offence! by far most people don\'t understand it - it is much more complicated than Bitcoin, and also I did not understand it until I educated myself in 2008. A close relative of mine works at a bank in a leading position but still doesn\'t understand it - he cannot even explain to me what fractional reserve banking means).\n\nSo here\'s a short explanation:\n\nCash (i.e. paper money) is "real money" or "central bank money" or "M0" money. On the other hand, if you have money in your bank account, this is only a promise of the bank that the bank pays you that amount of cash to you, if you wish. This is "M1" money (google for M0 and M1 money supply for example). Simply speaking, all electronic fiat money in our economy is M1 money (I omit now M2 and M3, not needed to explain these basics). Now you have to know that M1 money supply is *much* greater than M0 money supply, i.e. no bank in the world could pay out all their bank customers in cash if they had to ("bank run" sort of event). This is the consequence of "fractional reserve banking", which is practice all over the world in all banks.\n\nNow if you transfer "M1 money" from one (greek) bank account to another (greek) bank account (no matter how much), you don\'t take away M0 money from the (greek) banking system (you just move it from one greek bank to another). In fact, the amount of M1 sitting in the (greek) banks does not change, and also the amount of M0 sitting in the (greek) banks remains unchanged. In other words, the ratio M1/M0, the fractional reserve ratio, remains the same for the greek banking system.\n\nHowever, if you withdraw that same amount of cash from a greek bank\'s ATM, then you reduce M1 and M0 of this bank (and hence of the greek bank system in total) by this amount. Thereby, the ratio M1/M0 increases  because M0<M1. At some point, M0 becomes zero while M1 (= bank\'s liabilities to its clients) is still >0. Then the greek banking system is bankrupt.\n\nHope this clarified why withdrawing cash is fundamentally different from an electronic bank transfer WITHIN greece.\n\nFinal note:\nNote that an electronic bank transfer from a greek bank account to a non-greek bank account is equivalent to a cash withdrawal, because the greek bank needs to transfer the same amount of M0 money (= cash or central bank money) to the non-greek destination bank. So also in this case both M1 and M0 of the greek banking system gets reduced by the same amount, i.e. fully equivalent to a cash withdrawal. That\'s why capital controls always apply equally to limiting of cash withdrawals and to bank transfers towards OUTSIDE greece, whereas they don\'t apply to bank transfers WITHIN greece.\n\n*Edit: to the downvoter(s): please explain what part of my educational post you are disagreeing with. I really made an effort to explain the current money system as concisely and correctly as possible, don\'t understand why this gets down voted (more often than upvoted) - it irritates me.*': 3, "I would say it has more to do with the capital controls affecting the Greeks meaning they can't transfer enough Euro to btcgreece.": 2, "Btcgreece seems to be running its order book on top of a liquidity provider.

This is the beginning of summer, so hashrate will continue to decline significantly as July approaches, with difficulty struggling to catch up.

Someone will finally decide to be a leader and release some code and declare that they are making a fork.\n\n2.  The block reward decrease will happen and the dust will settle.\n\n3.  As temperatures begin to significantly decline during the last week of August, hashrate will rise and difficulty will be too low again, putting more coins than the algorithms plan on the market.\n\n4.  The natural length of the frenzy of bubbles is about two months, so the required time will simply have passed.\n\n\nI never considered a second altcoin bubble, though - it's something I'll have to think about.  A second altcoin bubble implies that the sequence would be that bitcoin goes into a bubble once it looks like people are going to adopt one of the hard forks that will come out.  It would make sense if the first altcoin bubble ends in late August, then there is another bitcoin bubble in September-November because that's when most proposals require consensus by (and it's the same time of year as the last bubble).\n\nBut I'm not sure why people would go back into altcoins when bitcoin crashes.  Remember that last time, litecoins went to 0.05.  If there is a bitcoin bubble to $4000, that implies that litecoins would already be worth $200 at the crash.

You're exactly right regarding there being no central exchange for reporting, but should the market mature, this would be a key component and valuable market data to traders and market participants.  In traditional capital markets, even OTC transactions in equities and fixed income needs to be reported to either the exchange or an SRO (generally by end of day).  For large equity trades via dark pools, these get reported to the exchange directly through [Trade Reporting Facilities](http://www.finra.org/industry/trade-reporting-facility-trf) and for fixed income / muni's trades get reported to the [MSRB EMMA program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Municipal_Market_Access).\n\nAs for the trends in the OTC market, I don't have exact figures, but at itBit, for example, we do facilitate large block orders and we have seen an increase in demand for these types of trades.  These would be the type of trades that would occur in the OTC market as well.
