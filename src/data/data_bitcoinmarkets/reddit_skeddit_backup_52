You just need money.\n\nWhat I think will be interesting to see is when big players who are not conspiring together start trying to manipulate the market...now that will be a show because they will start to compete over the average cost profit as the market builds support at a certain price. At the current moment it seems that the whale buy and sells are usually in 10,000 BTC denominations.

Those big holders has enough buying power in both btc and fiat money to draw the rates up to 400-450$ (MTgox), or down to 200-250$, easily. I tend to believe that those big holders are responsible to the big saturday night's correction, trying to buy back some coins that they sold before at 380-400$. But, 290-300$ is still a high price to buy back their coins; If those big holders were able to pull 105$ drop in rates within an hour on saturday, be sure they can do it again. And as we all know, people are greedy.\n> \n\nI do not disagree with your central point but I do believe that the whales (organized groups) are starting to become less of a factor; on the recent run up we saw a few individuals or groups attempt to crash the price many times and failed rather miserably. The larger the market capitalization the less it is likely to carry out manipulation for there are many more actors reducing your capacity to affect change. \n\nThis is not to say that it is impossible, I am just saying that it will become less likely and that from what I saw the last week of trading I saw many people dump 10-15K of BTC which only momentarily halted the upward trend. \n\n>So why didn't they pull the rates to 200$ on saturday?? Those big holders hold a lot of coins... \n\nAs with my previous point, there are a lot more actors now, many of which are very keen to purchase the coins that whales are trying to dump to force a down trend. \n\n>I tend to believe that most of the upwards trades we see right now is faked, meaning - an intra trading between organized manipulation groups.\n\nIt isn't impossible but you're talking about a very powerful entity to be able to affect the entirety of the price over three main exchanges. And again, the further along we go the less likely it is that somebody will have the capacity to carry this out. \n\nI have without a doubt seen manipulation in the past, and currently still with the alternative currencies on BTC-E but on such a massive & vast scale? It seems unlikely to me; not that it is impossible. \n\n>I was really impressed, and surprised, actually, that no panic sell occurred after MTgox DDOS-ed.\n\nIt is a very strong signal in regards to sentiment I feel; shows confidence and a maturing market.

The Chinese really are starting to dominate the market in a big way; this is only going to continue. Already we have seen BTC-CHINA break away numerous times and acted autonomously to the western markets; even when Mt.Gox fell they continued upwards a couple of times. This ties back to my previous argument; that there are now many actors attempting to influence the price of Bitcoin and therefore the ability to manipulate this market becomes much harder.

The long term, high quantity BTC holders that exist in the bitcoin world that have made huge influences on the market price (a.k.a whales) have amassed bankrolls from years past of investments and pre-asic mining.  This is a reasonably new bull-front for the Chinese and in the case of BTChina - the exchange has only been around since post-april crash prices.

": 3, 'I\'m not an expert trader, and know practically nothing about technical analysis... But as a psychologist, I would like to offer a few speculative, possible factors, who may indicate an upcoming correction:\n\n1. Human greediness- it is well known that some organized groups of big holders are deliberately manipulating btc rates. Those big holders has enough buying power in both btc and fiat money to draw the rates up to 400-450$ (MTgox), or down to 200-250$, easily. I tend to believe that those big holders are responsible to the big saturday night\'s correction, trying to buy back some coins that they sold before at 380-400$. But, 290-300$ is still a high price to buy back their coins; If those big holders were able to pull 105$ drop in rates within an hour on saturday, be sure they can do it again. And as we all know, people are greedy.\n\n2. So why didn\'t they pull the rates to 200$ on saturday?? Those big holders hold a lot of coins... If a too sharp panic sell starts, they might lose the ability to control it. Those manipulators don\'t want BTC to crash completely- they\'ve got a lot to lose if the public will lose trust in bitcoin. They just want to buy their coins back, as cheap as possible. So I tend to believe they are leaning to graded, control drops (for buy) and picks (to sell). If you paid an attention to the market behavior after MTgox was back to live - every time that the price began to drop too sharp, there was an immediate correction up, in minor amounts (usually less than 0.1 btc) - those corrections are not made by spontaneous buyers, in my opinion, I believe they were deliberately made in order to control the market, and stop the expected huge panic sell. It didn\'t happen, meaning that a good job was done.\n\n3. Everyone are waiting for the senate committee in usa at the 18.11. Most people will stick to their coins, and everyone who sold a lot of coins are waiting to buy them back. So does those great market manipulators. Taking a look at the trading volumes in the recent week, we can see that since saturday we had a big drop in trading volume. Most big trades were in significant price drops. If we compare it to wednesday to saturday, there is a big change in the market\'s behavior; prior to saturday\'s correction most of the high volume trades were at sharp uprisings, after saturday most of them are at major rates decreases. I believe it means that even if the price will rise back to 400$, less real people will sell their coins, and less real people will buy expensive; I tend to believe that most of the upwards trades we see right now is faked, meaning - an intra trading between organized manipulation groups. If my analysis is right, they probably begins to understand that people are less lean to buy now in those high rates, which will push them to the other end of profit - buying btc as cheap as possible. \n\n4. I was really impressed, and surprised, actually, that no panic sell occurred after MTgox DDOS-ed. Maybe the market is more educated now, maybe those manipulators I mentioned were "holding the horses", maybe the existence of a few more trading sites helped. Anyway, don\'t be mistaken - everyone who has his savings in MTgox are currently afraid. Me, myself -I would pull my savings from there as soon as possible. They proved again to be un-trustworthy. But! As we all know, withdrawing usd$ from MTgox is a long, frustrating process. But BTC withdrawal is quick and easy. What I\'m trying to say is that I believe that most of MTgox private clients will run to buy BTC as soon as the rates will drop next time significantly, and then would run to withdraw their coins. This is what I will personally do.\n\nIf my analysis is right- the market is waiting patiently and agitatedly at the same time, for the upcoming correction. Don\'t expect below 200$ rates, this would initiate panic sell, which might take the big manipulators control of the market out of their hands. They wouldn\'t let that happen, as long as they can. But, they wish to buy back cheap BTC; 300$ in my opinion is not cheap enough, I believe we will see a drop to 250$ at MTgox in the next 24 hours, maybe sooner. I expect another attempt to pull the price up to 400-450$ before the expected correction, in order to make people worry, and get them convinced to buy back their coins in lose rates; this would escalate the panic sell behavior when the correction will start. \n\nIt is only speculations; for me, I set some graded buying orders starting from 300$, until 225$ at the bottom. I recommend everyone, tr to resist the tempting fear, don\'t buy in a lose. I was reading a great economical article tonight, the guy said: "don\'t ever let a winning become a lose".

It means that if this were in fact the "end" of the rally, I\'d expect the price floor to now be somewhere close to $220 or so for a few months until another uptrend or whatever.

If they have pure FIFO matching, decent technology, and are trustworthy seems like a better place to trade than the US exchanges.

There is probably good edge in using other markets to skew your valuation and do one-legged pseudo-arb trades around it.\n\n-Lots of unmonitored resting orders "showing their hand" and to pick off on cross-market moves or to use when liquidating inventory that\'s moving against you.\n\nDo you know of any services that capture and distribute/sell historical full depth tick data for multiple exchanges? I am thinking it may be better to collect myself along with sending periodic orders deep in the book on each market to gauge latency as I capture, since it\'s hard to be confident in your incoming market data when exchanges like Gox have enormous lag during moves. Knowing exchange lag across all markets would probably be helpful anyway since you could use it as a signal to widen out or liquidate inventory.\n\nWith BTC China doing most volume do you think it leads price discovery (i.e. do spread divergences between BTC China and US exchanges tend to revert toward BTC China implied USD/BTC price or vice-versa?)

So now I am waiting for the corection to buy my coins back and start over; I came into a method which I believe will get me around 30-40% of profit over a bit longer time, but in a relaxed and patient way - my conecpt of being "strong hand". \n\nAs a conclusion, I agree with you that everyone who enters trading must educate himself, or he would find himself being the weak hand at the end; I have a strong background in statistics, but actually I kind of hate mathematics... So I would rely on my other skills in behavioral analysis from now on... Hope to get better, in my own way.\nI have only one fundumental advice for all new comers: choose your trading platforms wisely!!! I see 4 important factors: \n\n1. Most important: The ability to withdrawl your earnnings, both in btc or fiat money, as easy as possible. Being practically unable to withdrawl your profit in USD means that being a winner in USD, is only a virtual win. \n\n2. Resilliance to hackers attacks and technical problems.\n\n3. volatility - a more stable platform allows the common trader a bit of time to anticipate upcoming changes, by monitoring the other less stable platforms.\n\n4. Least importanat, but still a factor: Trading fees.\n\nOne major platform failed big time in all of those 4 factors, in my opinion, during this week. I wouldn\'t call it by name, but you can guesse for sure.\n\nHope I didn\'t make too many spelling/grammer mistakes, English is not my main language, as I noted before': 1}, ('Has anyone beaten the buy-and-hold strategy over the last 3 months?', 19): {'[deleted]': 11, "With futures you are leveraging your coins.

Then again ineffectiveness of a law doesn't normally stop the law from being passed, to be real the only thing holding back regulation is Public Relations and backlash; the ineffectiveness of regulation just increases this effect.\n\n**Best case scenario:** Any laws or regulation that will be better than very unpopular that make IRS/FED/Treasury more money will very likely be a guarantee to happen. This will include tweaks to laws to incorporate BTC so it can better be taxed, this includes paying people in BTC, and BTC sales tax.\n\n**Possible:** Requiring verified Identification for any Bitcoin account over a certain dollar amount.\n\n**Worst case scenario:** In order to centralize and reduce the number of Bitcoin businesses to make them easier to manage, regulation can be introduced that requires internet sales tax on every single transfer and each of these have to abide by individual state laws. Bitcoin exchanges may require difficult to acquire licenses with heavy legal fees. To really actually go after Bitcoin though would take international co-operation, and since the Trans-Pacific Trade agreement has a few items that have to do with trade, virtual currencies might be found as an addition.

Like an idiot I threw in a few $k right off the bat when I cut my teeth day trading.  Suffice to say I almost had my balls cut off at the same time.  In my case losing this money wasn't catastrophic, and did ultimately sharpen my determination to be a lot more methodical about trading.  Emotional trading is likely the number one culprit for losses.  You should pay great attention to your thought processes as you trade, and always take some time to honestly analyse what you've done.  If you make a stupid 'bet', admit it and learn from it.  Add that information to your bank of knowledge and continue to sharpen your trades.  Bitcoin is surprisingly easy to learn, with many great trading resources at your disposal.  There's also a good community (outside of the troll box!) who are regularly discussing all things related.  I know I've personally benefitted from information many guys in here have given, and hopefully I've done the same.  \n\nkorjax has laid out most of what you need to consider, but I'll just add if you do begin to day trade more seriously then set yourself targets and stick to them.  As you learn to recognise market movement, start getting in the habit of setting marginally flexible buy and sell points.  You have the advantage of being able to watch several exchanges at once when taking a decision.  Once in the habit you can set yourself daily profit targets (or loss limits), and stick with them accordingly.  Don't deviate from this, except in extreme circumstances where you find yourself in an exaggerated market move.  There will be times for example when you may be approaching your sell price when without warning a large buy takes place on another exchange.  In these circumstances you can turn a much larger than expected profit, but again you must have a methodology in place to allow you to act quickly without making an emotionally derived error.  This might be tough at first, the first time you go into the green for a few hundred dollars or more will be a rush, but remember it can always turn around and bite you in the arse in a flash if you don't pay attention.\n\nThat's the short version...

It takes years of experience, education, etc before you can get decent enough at it to make money consistently. Because if it didn\'t require that and the ability to trade without emotion, everyone would do it for easy money.\n\nNever day trade with your whole investment, especially if you are new. If you put in 10BTC into the market, maybe try and day trade with only 1-2BTC of that and once you run out you are done. Make sure its a big enough amount for you to care, but not so big that if you lose it you\'ll really regret it.\n\nDon\'t try and time the peaks and valleys every time, you won\'t win (especially for really volatile and special-case times, like right now, unless a pattern has developed). I\'ve been the most successful trading when I\'ve made educated positions that I can keep for a time I determine, usually a day or more. I\'ve been the least successful when I try and day trade a whole bunch in one day trying to catch peaks and valleys or when I\'ve decided to throw a ton of money at a "sure bet!!" only for the trend to immediately reverse and me lose a bunch.\n\nNever panic buy/sell just because you see a bunch of green or red, but there is nothing wrong with doing a stop loss if you see red and are almost entirely sure that it\'ll really tank hard. I.e. the big drop from 1-2 days ago. A great trading opportunity there, considering the factors that led to it and the intensity of the first drop - selling right as the drop was going on and then buying back in at much lower would have been a great profit potential. But hindsight is always 20/20.\n\nI think the most important thing is when buying and selling, make a point to take a position when you do that and stick with it. If you don\'t know what position to take, don\'t blindly buy/sell. If your position is obviously not going to work out then get out of it (i.e. bought LTC at 4.25 and noticed it is going down regardless of what it was doing before despite waiting it out and seeing where it would go? get out!). This is why I find it works best when I try and trade from 1-4H charts vs worshipping the 15m chart. It gives you a good picture and a much less risky bet in which to take a position, but technically at those ranges its not so much day trading a bunch during the day.\n\nEither way be prepared to lose.

Here are a few tips to held speed up the curve.\n\n1.  If you haven't already, build a spreadsheet.  Keep track of every trade, so that you have an honest assessment of your track record, and can compare against a buy and hold strategy to see how well you are doing.  This spreadsheet also lets you see how much a potential trade will help you or hurt you before deciding to commit.\n\n2.  Do not use whole numbers, and even better do not put your orders on the books.  Especially at BTC-e, you will be beaten by bots that set their price .000000001 away from your standing order.  If you can afford to time it, wait for the market to come to you.  (This advice is more important with larger amounts, .1 BTC is not going to move the market much).\n\n3.  Do not get all the way to one side.  If you are doing that, you could have saved yourself a lot of time and worry by just buying and holding.\n\n4.  Divide your trades into the smallest amounts your can reasonable manage given your time and resources.  You will be much more likely to catch a reversal or not miss a target if you plan to (for example) buy 20@102, 20@101, 20@100, 20@99, and 20@98, rather than trying to hit 100@100 on the nose every time.\n\n5.  Have a clear goal.  If you are trying to make BTC, make sure your spreadsheet generates a new bid that reinvest USD but not BTC, or vice versa.  Have defined profit and loss targets that keep you from getting in too deep, or being forced to wait 6 months in order to avoid a loss.  Day trading, unlike buy and hold, is all about liquidity.\n\n6.  Given the small investment you are considering and the state of the current market, i think your best bet is MNC.

You will have a tough time keeping ahead of the fees and the much bigger fish pushing for what they want.  Better to just buy and hold.\n\nLTC - Great fundamentals, but obviously overbought right now.  Nice to see the interest from China, but there are some serious whales in the LTC world, and the price will be back down to $2.50 before the new year.\n\nNVC - the wildcard, always defies logic.  Some very questionable fundamentals tied to some good ideas.  Heavily premined.  good to have a little, scared to have a lot.\n\nNMC, TRC - recovering from protocol failures.  Good upside potential if they really recover, but do you want to invest in a currency that has already failed once?\n\nFTC - an LTC clone with an avid marketer behind it.  Easy to ridicule, but better marketing may be just  what is needed for an altcoin breakthrough, and it has steadily gained market cap.  Heavily pre mined and not much volume though, so it would be easy to lose your ass.\n\nXPM - the flavor of the month.  I like Sunny King's style and the innovation behind XPM, but this one is a non-starter because of unlimited supply.  Only way this goes long term is down.\n\nPPC - the other Sunny King coin.  Huge future potential, consistent growth of market cap, good volume.  This would be my first choice over MNC, except that PPC isn't cheap *right now*.\n\nWDC - another alt that has climbed above $1mil market cap, good volatility, on several markets.

Sure the walls could be from the people who are selling but some of that is new money too.

You don't sell but instead buy gift cards with the bitcoins when you want to buy something. The main idea is to buy in and hold.

To this point I have always remained skeptical of Bitcoin's value after it's exponential rise from ~204 USD to the current 400+. Generally, money is meant to represent something; a fungible token of work done - E.g. instead of trading you a pig for a loaf of bread, I can use ubiquitously accepted fiat. \n\nNow, Bitcoin does have a real economy in the guise of the black markets. These are solely denominated in Bitcoin and force a steady flow of fiat in and out through the system - but does buying drugs justify 400 USD? I would have said No, but I have recently reconsidered this viewpoint based on three things; \n\n1) As someone in the /r/Bitcoin reddit pointed out; the audience involved. Geeks, libertarians, anti-statists. Individuals who will buy and hold Bitcoin regardless of whether it goes to zero because they believe in the *idea*. That alone is a powerful motivator. \n\n2) The global and ubiquitous accessibility of Bitcoin. Financial markets (derivitives, bonds, stocks, forex etc) are generally accessible only to the wealthy. The lower echelons of society cannot participate in any meaninful way. With Bitcoin (and I cannot believe I'm writing this frankly) - you can be *anyone* and expose yourself to a global market for better or worse. Provided there is a Chinese, American, Ugandan, British, Peruvian, [Insert Nationality here] 'Peter' to take 'Paul's (Your) Bitcoins, there will always be a market. And someones always going to want to move money for one reason or another (E.g. escaping capital restrictions, hedging etc). \n\n3) A reduction in the reliance on country/region specific events. For example, the US government backs USD and this means anything they say that affects the perceived value of USD has a ripple effect on everyone that is pegged to or uses USD. The global nature of Bitcoin means that - short of a concerted effort to eliminate Bitcoin<->Fiat exchanges - the price of Bitcoin can - in theory - reflect a more global view of the world. \n\nDon't assume its all roses though. There are still significant regulatory and technical issues surrounding Bitcoins' growth (E.g. scalability) and awkward questions over what effect disasters such as blockchain forks would have.

Even when the price raised to 391$ yesterday, the volume of trading was quite \xc2\xa0low, comparing to the last peak of 395$. in my opinion it is an indicator that things can go either way, up or down, and one of the main factors who might initiate the following developments, is a significant amount of money being invested upwards or downwards; i.e- a "whale", or an organized manipulation group, taking an action in one of those two options. A major difference is needed now to wake the market- I guesse that if the price will go higher than 430$ (Gox) or lower than 300$, we will see a sudden abrupt wake up call in all markets.\xc2\xa0\n\nAnother factor we must take into consideration of course is that evidence, that the chineese market -behaves differently. But, although the comperatively high volume of trades in BTCchina, the price changes there over the last few days, are at the same pattern as in the $ market; meanning that those two different markets tend to corelate (more or less), regarding to the price. I think it is not a certain thing trying to predict which market is the leader and which one is the follower; they might change those roles from time to time.

The mass of the public will keep sitting on the fence until the next big thing would start. But, today, after 4 sleepless nights, I\'m getting a bit tired of this game, a doubt is coming to my mind if my prespective, which untill now predicted a big downwards corection, is still the right one.

If we only manage to crawl past $400 (Gox) then it's more than likely that the panic sell mentality amongst the chart zombies will be heightened into forcing a sell off.  I wouldn't be at all surprised to see bigger players testing this ground with a short sell, and letting the price slip back before committing to a larger buy in.  If played closely enough it could scalp a few percentage points off the total buy in cost to $420+.  As some other subscribers have already noted, there is a degree of insurance against a heavy drop since no major players are about to let their holding be dented by any significant value.  No one in their right mind is looking to make a double top out of $400 either, unless there's  longer game in play, at which point you can overturn all the bullish sentiment and start rewriting what you had in mind for the mid-term.  For the time being though it's sideways in a $10 channel while the bots do their thing.  Gox has a current bid sum of almost $22m, though anyone watching closely will have noticed that drop back to $14m temporarily at least once.  I wonder if some of that money hasn't been sent to another exchange to pick up some cheaper coins before the big run at $500+.  And yes, I do think we're set for that very shortly, but only when we are taken with some momentum past $420, and only when China agrees to play along and buy in with everyone else.  This begs the question of timing...  If this is to be kicked off by traders on Gox, it needs to happen at a time when China is paying attention.  Most significant moves have generally taken place between 9am & 2pm EST.  Something to think about.\n\nAnother thing to consider...\n\nGeneral media attention isn't going to really fully come on board until we are up at that $500+ mark and growing.  There's nothing taking shape (of interest to the masses) that hasn't been looked at already, but rest assured when bitcoin breaks $500 people will be compelled to pay more attention, mainstream media included.  There'll still be drivel dropping in SR references and all the usual biased BS, but if all goes well in the next week we are golden.\n\nAdditionally a word to those of you looking to register accounts with BTCChina...\n\nYou need to have a mainland China account with one of the approved banks to withdraw cash from the exchange, and it will withdraw to RMB only.  So while there may be some advantage to be had accumulating additional coins day trading, unless you have an account here in China there's no arbitrage available to you.  Can't say I'm unhappy about this, it hopefully transpires to remain open for longer.\n\nFinally...\n\nWith regard to content, number of daily posts, etc etc:  I agree posts should be on point with regard to the market, but for fuck sake try and keep a sense of humour.  I just today deliberately made a couple of sarcastic posts in the stickied Tuesday thread to see how many downvotes I'd pick up.  (9).  Call it curiosity, call it my own personal sentiment barometer, call it moderate satisfaction in knowing that some of you miserable humourless sons of bitches are reading this right now and are even more agitated at my slight...   But seriously ease up a bit and consider helping newcomers out.  They will ultimately benefit all of us in the long term, and it's fairly neat that we have such a high level of new interest in the very things that once upon a time you yourself were new to.  Give those sticks a little wiggle and see if you can pull them out of your arse finally.\n\n:D\n\n**edit:**  Half way through typing this I've noticed a 1.3k coin buy on Gox that didn't even stir +5 RMB on the price in China, and we're already back in the channel at $390.

The Bubble Index does not say when the bubble will crash, only that there is one present. In general, bubbles form when the growth rate of any trade-able asset exceeds rational expectations. I think the The Bubble Index is showing that the currency has gotten ahead of itself. There may be a correction soon to a lower retrenchment level. After this correction, it will probably resume upwards. Also, these LPPL oscillations have been shown to occur in all types of indices: Currencies, Stocks, SP500 and other market indices. The purpose of this index is to help ordinary people make smart decisions with their money. Many smart people can "smell" a market bubble a mile away.': 7, ">Bitcoin has not reached its highest levels seen earlier this year, investors in the currency should be cautious \n\nOld article then, cos we're already nearly double the previous high.  ": -1, 'To be honestly nobody has experience doing this, and bitcoin is still fundamentally a commodity right now and has proven itself to work like one.\n\nPeople say "this time its different because its going vertical because bitcoin is a technology!" don\'t really know what they are talking about.\n\n1. Going vertical implies adoption rates, not prices. Sure, they do relate to each other but you can have a high adoption rate but the prices crashing if the situation is right.\n\n2. Bitcoin isn\'t exactly "a technology" or a "service" it is also a commodity and a currency. You can\'t just assume that because twitter and facebook adopted an S-curve in growth rates that Bitcoin will as well, because they are very very different things. The fact that bitcoin is being actively traded right now throws an interesting mixup into that expectation alone.\n\n3. Because nothing like bitcoin has ever existed, its really quite impossible to truly predict how or when the price will rise. The only thing that most people feel pretty confident in is that "in the future, the price will go higher" due to adoption and how the currency works.\n\n4. If everyone expects an S curve like growth in value, an S curve like growth in *value* will likely not happen.\n\nHere\'s my out of left field prediction: the current price rise is in fact a bubble and it will pop. However, due to the amount of serious press and momentum going into it beyond april and the huge upsurge in china, it seems very likely to me that the bubble will be like 2011\'s bubble, which so far has been Bitcoin\'s largest bubble from a logrithmic perspective (when it went from pennies to being worth $30 for the first time).\n\nI don\'t think we\'ll quite get to the scale of that first bubble since that was the first time bitcoin was worth anything and as the prices get higher the harder it is to make it go up more, but I think we\'ll likely see a similar style growth that will easily eclipse april\'s growth (which this bubble still hasn\'t even exceeded yet logrithmically).\n\nWhich means if true, this price rise still has a while to go and we could easily see $1k-$2k/BTC before a crash and/or a bear market over a long term period before it begins to settle or flatline near where we are now before continuing up.\n\nI\'d be kicking myself over selling last night if it wasn\'t for the fact that I could really use the money now and any profit is good profit. I\'m planning on buying back in sometime. Maybe I\'ll throw some more btc in during the next correction and a more serious amount of BTC in in 4-6 months or however long it takes for this to reverse into a bear market for a while.': 4, "You do realize that's a joke site, right?

Nice automoderator!\n\nI was listening to Ep. 58 of Let\'s Talk Bitcoin (here: http://letstalkbitcoin.com/e58-the-price-of-money/) and they had a great discussion starting around 33:10. It\'s worth listening to the whole episode, and these guys consistently create very insightful content and are worth a subscription.\n\nSome points to take away from the discussion:\n\n* Bitcoin is its own asset class. It behaves like a stock/bond/commodity/currency that\'s traded 24 hours a day, globally, and we\'ve never had an asset class like this before. Therefore, don\'t be surprised when the tools we have fall short in their analytic ability.\n\n* BTCChina represents half the total bitcoin sales. We\'ve never had this happen before.\n\n* The prices on other exchanges are starting to surpass Gox for the first time, ever. This means it will be easier to cash out from Gox by buying bitcoins, and moving them to other services like Coinbase. (Personally, I think this is good news for Gox, since I suspect they had to go fractional reserve in the wake of their Dwolla account seizure. This will ease their pain a bit, and let them get back on their feet and hopefully allow them to implement some of the long-awaited upgrades they\'ve been talking about). And this is important because healthy, stable exchanges are important for the Bitcoin economy.\n\n* I was not previously aware of this, but the Yuan is a very tightly controlled currency. They\'re not really allowed to exchange their currency for any other currencies. Because the government of China has put its seal of approval on Bitcoin, Bitcoin becomes one of the only available investments to the Chinese population.\n\n* The Chinese population seems to value Bitcoin because it is outside the control of the Government.\n\n* The middle class in China has a savings rate that exceeds 50%. (Read: lots of funds to invest).\n\n* The Chinese Government has officially endorsed Bitcoin because it would rather be in a world where there is a reserve currency that is controlled by no one (and thus, free from manipulation), than in a world where the reserve currency is the ever-inflating US petrodollar. Neutrality is better than a potential enemy.\n\nOther points to note: China wants to double the size of its economy by 2030, and historically, it has been able to double approximately every 8 years.\n\n* This means that this latest rise in price we\'ve seen isn\'t caused by sentiment, but by true expansion. When you have 50% of the market controlled by China, that\'s tremendous growth.\n\n* This is the first major non-Western adoption of Bitcoin. Wait for nations like India or Brazil to really catch on.\n\n* The US is positioning itself *really* poorly by approaching Bitcoin as an enemy to their hegemony, and is already planting the seeds of its own destruction by sending the newest wave of innovations abroad. The game the US plays is "what will cause the most harm to us." Will sending all the Bitcoin business to China be more harmful to their hegemony, or will allowing bitcoin to continue in a relatively unfettered manner be more harmful?\n\nI think it\'s safe to say that the growth we\'ve seen thus far isn\'t even all that large in proportion to the rest of China. They have a *huge* population. We\'ve probably only tapped the nerdy types (think: Chinese redditors, if there is such a thing) who can navigate the software and exchanges, let alone completely grok the concept of Bitcoin. We\'ve got a way to go before China gets to April 2013 levels of sentimental.\n\nSome people are suggesting that we\'re in March 2013. I think we might even be in February, though it\'s hard to say.\n\nWe\'ll probably break 500 in a matter of days (if not hours at this point).\n\nPutting my two week target to 700.\n\nPutting my two month target between 1200-2000.\n\nAfter that, I\'m expecting a crash. The market *is* comfortable with 3-digit prices. It\'ll be harder to tell how comfortable it is with 4-digit prices until we get to that bridge.\n\nAnd I think it goes without saying that these are all just educated guesses on my part.': 33, 'Looks like the 500 wall just met the Kool-aid guy.
