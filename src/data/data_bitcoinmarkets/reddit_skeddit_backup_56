I promise to pay you, or the person you give the coin to, 1 orange. USD can go bust tomorrow, but the blue coins are still worth an orange.  \n  \nSupply is not a problem (for me, the exchange) because I charge $1Million per 'blue' bitcoin.  \nDemand is the demand for fixed price bitcoin.   \n  \nBear in mind, if you buy a bitcoin somewhere else, it's not valid. There's no 'market economy'. You buy from ME, else I won't buy it back. (it's my special blue paint, which nobody can hack).  \n  \nSo,  \nA) traders will NOT be interested in my $1M coin.

That is the 'service', if demand is zero, then it's just a shit idea and won't work. Fine. If demand is a zillion, that's fine. If I'm charging $1M/btc, I can easily get enough BTC to cover that (until BTC price goes over 1M)  \n  \n  \n2) Exchange bitcoin as soon as you get it.   \nYes, that works fine.   \nExcept it doesn't work fine yet...   \nIt's far from a world-wide feature.

Why would anyone sell Bitcoin for $100 when he can get better price somewhere else? Or buy at $100 if Bitcoin price elsewhere is less? Every currency has moving price because moving price balances supply and demand. Fix the price, and you lose either supply or demand - or you lose money while you try to artificially manipulate supply and demand.\n\nBitcoin price is becoming less volatile as market penetration grows. Solution to volatility "problem" is built into Bitcoin by Satoshi himself, first you have volatile price which attracts early adopters and speculators, and when you have critical adoption mass price becomes less volatile since no single player or group of players can move price by himself. Moving price for a significant amount is becoming harder and harder, as we\'ve seen with Silk Road - it took two days and the price already bounced back to $5/5% difference from where it started.

Was that cheap all things considered?  Maybe.  There are numerous voices before me who would readily argue this price was still overvaluing BTC.  Yes, this is on a per-bitcoin basis, as is the speculative market we are in.  The speculation is after all what is driving the price.  Further, comparing BTC to Google is somewhat irrelevant when we can not accurately gauge the valuation of BTC as an entity outside of it's speculated value.  This will always be the case regardless of future.\n\nOf course I understand and appreciate the 'phenomenon' and all associated paraphernalia bitcoin has introduced to the 'world', this is the very reason I've invested personally in the first place.  It's perhaps one of the most genuinely interesting ideologies to come along in years, but it does have a considerable number of real world problems that are impossible to overlook.  I always dislike the thought of parroting myself even remotely, but the dirty word 'adoption' is always the first to spring to mind.  Pressure continues to be exerted on companies within the US who are associated with BTC.  Only this week we've seen Dwolla exit, the latest in a long line of recent departures from the BTC economic sphere.  Technological wonderment aside, until there is some form of standardised integration for merchants ready to accept BTC, we are left with the 'how can I buy bitcoins...?' economy that as of now is less than streamlined.  And am I being paranoid in thinking that the US government would (quietly or otherwise) be looking to shut down bitcoin if it could?  What's the angle for it to exist as far as they are concerned?  And what if the FBI could get to the 600k (??) coins supposedly nabbed from DPR?  In the current climate it's not a stretch to imagine an immediate sell off.  Or is it?  Well this is essentially my point...  There are so many unknowns at present that it does not matter one single byte that bitcoin might be the best thing since sliced bread, what matters is whether or not it stands up financially amidst it's almighty competition.  There are so many scenarios both negative and positive blurring the lines.\n\nAnd what of China?  A country synonymous with interference and censorship, beset by a regime so vehemently manipulative it will for example allow shadow banking to prop up it's GDP by estimates of anything from 40-70%.  Only when it suits of course, otherwise the party will hand out death sentences to anyone considered to be 'out of line'.  A grey area if ever there was one.  Bitcoin will be ignored (officially) for the time being, it doesn't represent a significant enough market to be of interest.  That could forever change in a heartbeat to any imaginable drastic measure, and there would be no recourse to speak of for anyone considered to be crossing the party line.  Incidentally Google knows this only too well, and continues to suffer interference of service from within the mainland.\n\nOnce again my opinion herein is SPECULATION, as is the market.  No guarantees, no rainbows to infinity, just present day pricing compared to previous.  This is definitively more logical than suggesting a value on the basis of something that DOES NOT YET EXIST.  It definitely maybe might exist, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not next week, maybe never.  How much is that worth?": 2, 'this post just became a mind game': 2, 'Just let me dream.....

There will always be an unknown element to the market (take last week for example), just as there will always be indication of what's ahead.\n\nFor now it looks like we'll continue to revolve around $142 for a bit.  I'm surprised to see Gox closing on $144, though this looks like an erratic bot to me that got the math wrong.  Bitstamp too has been edged up to $128, and perhaps by no coincidence.  I'm positive there's a measured attempt to test for upward momentum, but only in order to sell.  Rest assured there are key players who made enough profit last week to play bull for the time being (tentatively), and still make more money on the way back down.  We keep having these same discussions on price, but reality is these coins are expensive.  A push upwards only comes when there's added inherent value, and that only comes when a significant amount of new money enters the market with some consistency.  And then it needs to keep coming, or we will just see those who came in first selling off.\n\nAgain I'll admit I'm somewhat surprised (and encouraged) that we bounced back to current price, though this is temporary and will adjust accordingly soon enough.

An example?  The U.S. government has resisted levying an internet sales tax for years, despite the significant revenue it could provide the federal government, and despite good arguments for it to level the playing field between merchants in different U.S. states (some of which do not charge sales tax in most states, creating an instant 8-9% pricing advantage over many other merchants).  The reason?  They did not want to stifle an emerging marketplace.\n\nBut what about what they did to peer-to-peer file sharing years ago?  Well, tell me how peer-to-peer file sharing helped the U.S. economy in any way.  The U.S. is the top intellectual property country in the world, and this technology threatened to severely undermine the revenues of many U.S. industries (movies, music, etc.).  Whatever minor benefits this technology provided were far outweighed, in the eyes of the U.S. government, by the potential damage it would do to the U.S. economy.\n\nBitcoin is just totally different.  Whatever damage it can do to U.S. interests is far outweighed by the the economic benefits it can provide to the country.\n\nBelieve me, the U.S. loves to get involved when it can in the name of "consumer protection" and "anti-terrorism" and "anti-money laundering".  It also likes having the strongest economy in the world.  If there is a way for the U.S. to regulate Bitcoin within its borders without killing it off, you can be sure it will happen.  In fact, I believe the federal government is going to preempt the space so that money transmitter licenses will not have to be applied for in the 47 states that currently require it.

There's no absolute, definite reference point from where to tell whether the coins are over- or underpriced, it's just always going to depend on your point of view. You can do the math and argue that given the current economic market volume of Bitcoin from a prespective of merchants and consumers, there's no justification for a price higher than $100, AND you could also argue that given how well it's survived since 2009 against all sorts of technical and market issues, how well the technology behind it is holding against massive surges in users with every bubble, and how tiny the adoption currently is, there's a tremendous potential for what it can become in the next five years and hence it must ultimately become more valuable.\n\n": 8}}, '10-05-2013': {('Saturday 5th October 2013', 14): {"I haven't been following PPC for a long time, however I was fortunate enough to notice the upward movement about a week ago and bought several thousand.\n\nIt appears there are two factors that are driving much of this:\n\n1. The recent increase in mining difficulty has reduced the rate at which new coins are minted (for PPC an increase in difficulty reduces the block reward). Because less proof-of-work coins are being minted, this makes the proof-of-stake mining much more attractive (since the coins you mint with POS are less diluted by new POW coins). This causes more people to buy and hold, which increases the price per coin, which adds more incentive to mine, which increases difficulty and causes a further decrease in the block reward. See here for difficulty chart: [link] (http://bitinfocharts.com/comparison/difficulty-ppc.html)\n\n2. This proposal on ppcointalk on Sept 28 has generated a lot of intrest from the community: [link] (http://www.ppcointalk.org/index.php?topic=527.15).

I hope to cover them all.  \n  \n1) bitcoin is open-source, so you or I could easily make bitcoin2-3-4. Just by tweaking the settings, we get a whole new altcoin. Generally, I find bitcoin is the best balance of this-and-that. Sacrifice this for that, long-term and short-term and usability, bitcoin took the mature choices.

There is no link between electricity cost and performance. The asics now use many thousands of times less power than tech from 1 year ago to do the same work.  \n  \nSomething I doubt many people know: If all the miners turned off their BTC rigs, and we just left one computer doing all the work, it could easily do all the 'mining'/processing of the entire network. This might be an exaggeration, but the point is, the extra hardware simply 'adds resilience'. The work is still done in the same time (1 block every 10 minutes), and it doesn't matter how many, or how good the mining machines are. Bitcoin is technically beautiful.  \n  \nAt the start of the lifecycle, miners are rewarded for new coins. It's easy peasy to get thousands of coins per day on a normal PC. If these coins are worth more in the future, you can make money.  \n  \nPeople have 200,000 BTC that they made mining in college over a term / whatever.  \n  \nThe next interest group is investors. So, miners ROI is always at the start of a coin, and means nothing for it's uptake or survival.   \n  \nThere MIGHT WELL BE a link between mining difficulty and coin-price. Because the supply of new coins to the market only happens if miners sell. If they can't sell for enough money, they wont sell = price rise (lack of supply). [See graph](http://www.bitcoinx.com/charts/).  (notice the lag, after a bubble. Price rise = huge delayed mining uptake)\n  \nIf you're an investor, you want to make money. So if a coin (any coin) rises in value, then you can make money. Regardless if you believe it has a future or not. I invest in bitcoin, because I love it like a teddy, and because I think it has a future.   \n  \nI don't want altcoins to be on the map, because they make it so much harder for newbies to understand the 'world' of bitcoin, which is already confusing enough.   \n  \nThat said, after that nice guy posted on our website, I got some PPC. I will hold it for a week or two at most. I hope PPC, LTC and all the others die painfully (hi downvotes!). I am relatively confident they will.   \n  \nAs the other guy said, diversifying in altcoins does not seem like much diversity.  \n  \nThe real threat to BTC is some utterly different utterly better thing. Ripple looked interesting. It's like a community money-transfer thing through 'trusted nodes'.   \n  \nWith the new ASICS, they are hardware miners which work on BTC. They can probably be firmware updated to do SOME other coins, but maybe not PPC for example (ignorant statement).  \n   \nIn terms of mining, I think many miners switched to other coins when BTC became less profitable/not viable. Some would do it to trade for BTC. I never bothered mining altcoin, they weren't even all that easy when I got to them.  \n  \nI think it's significant that the price of bitcoin has risen and held, where other coins have a) not achieved anything like the value and b) dived.   \n  \nBitcoin is the original and still the best  \n(might not be true)  ": 1, 'smart; and unlike LTC, ppc will benefit from ASICs hitting the market.': 2, "The scrypt thing (to my understanding) is better suited to CPU's and not graphics cards.

My understanding is that CPUs are useless for mining litecoin now, and that it's harder work for GPUs too, but they're the only way forward. So.. solves nothing. I imagine litecoin miners are ex-bitcoin miners who haven't 'let go', but [this graph's mining difficult graph](http://ltc.block-explorer.com/charts) suggests that mining is stagnating or not growing much.

Bitcoin mining is not intrinsically energy consuming, it just happens to be.  \n  \nMining monopolization is a problem in bitcoin, but technology seems to provide a more level playing ground. As it has panned out - it is far more profitable for a ASIC developing company, to sell a mining product, than to develop the machine to mine themselves. This ensures un-monopolisation. Mining pools are a bit of a problem, but they are \'staffed\' by miners, who all want to see the network continue, so would just switch pool if they realised their pool had \'gone bad\'.  \n  \nI think there are enough intensives that the bitcoin network has no worries. As I said, It seems to be a near perfect system. An idea that can ONLY grow.  \n  \nI consider bitcoin safe from a 51% attack. \n': -1, 'Very interesting, thanks.

Also, bear in mind that competition is not only about offering better features but also overcoming social momentum, which is already a lot for Bitcoin, in my opinion. Miners already *do* hop between Bitcoin and the altcoins that provide them the best income AFAIK, save for those who don't like altcoins at all. Mining is mostly part of a culture than a business, that's why you see lots of people buying expensive ming equipment even when difficulty is skyrocketing.\n\nHaving said this, note that neither Bitcoin nor any altcoin that I know about depend economically on mining, only technically. Hashing power don't dictate exchange rates.\n\nAlso, diversification is useful to reduce risk when the assets you hold are unlikely to move in the same direction but coins are on the contrary, very tightly linked in price. For instance, when SR was seized BTC fell and so did LTC, then both recovered.

This means there's less incentive to centralize, and more incentive for casual people to mine.  \n  \nThis is not like bitcoin, where nobody casually mines (any more), and the only way to be competitive is to have huge amounts of capital and a big, static mining room or something.

Gox did not represent a reasonably comfortable option even before their withdrawal issues (send my money to Japan?  Why do I need to do that?

Banks aren't creating money out of thin air. They re-lending the same money that gets lent back to them. \n\nThis _can_ similarly be done with Bitcoin. \n\neg. Customer A deposts 1000 BTC in to the bank. Bank lends 900 BTC to Customer B (Bank's ledger now shows owing 1000 BTC, and being owed 900 BTC, and holding 100 BTC) , customer B spends that 900 BTC at customer C, customer C deposits 900 in bank, bank lends 810 BTC to customer D... (Banks ledger now shows them owing 1900 BTC, being owed 1710 BTC and holding 190 BTC). \nThe same 1000 BTC are being lent and relent to accumulate both debt and credit on the banks ledger. They're not 'making money out of thing air'. \n\nThis kind of lending is a good thing, because it allows the money to be used when it's not otherwise being used by it's owner.": 1, "After googling some:  \nan NSL is a [National Security Letter]\n(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_security_letter)  \n  \n[Lavabit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavabit) was an 'encryted email' service that was linked to edward snowden, and has put up this [non-specific message](http://lavabit.com/) because some kind of government intervention has happened. \n  \nAre you suggesting that if they take out the Pools, then they diminish the bitcoin network's strength? So could attack? Or that they'd use the exisiting mining pools against bitcoin? My point was the pools are made up of miners (independent) and have no/limited strength in themselves. Also I think 1 government could only send nasty letters to mining pools in their country?\n  \nI realised that people mining altcoin might 'come back' to defend bitcoin if the worst happened??

The Snowden revealed stuff was hidden for years.\n\nPeople mining altcoin are most likely doing that with GPU using scrypt.

There would have to be a lot of thought put into it, and from my experience in the world of finance, that will not happen with these people--they are just too short-sighted, ignorant, risk-averse. \n\n>Surely banks could work just as profitably in a bitcoin only world? \n\nPerhaps, but it would have to be real bank--unlike the current clusterfuck of fiat banks that can be bailed out by the government with the monopoly money. In fact, I think one could create a type of fractional or full-reserve bitcoin bank  on their own that holds all deposits in bitcoins, and cashes out to fiat. The benefit is that you can offer a higher *fiat* interest rates than banks can on CDs, and other financial instruments. \n\n>Don't they take people's money, then lend it to people, and get interest? Would they not just do the same, but with coins?\n\nNo. With bitcoin you can't turn around and make-up money like a fractional reserve banking system can. You see when you deposit $1000 with your bank, they put $100 of that into their reserve (you can still access it if you want to), and now they can turn around and make a loan of $900 dollars. That $900 is new money--it came from simple adding numbers to the banks balance sheet. With bitcoin that cannot be done. \n\n": 1, "This is pretty lame, but you might need something like $60M to get the technology to have a shot at 51% bitcoin. Maybe more because of the way the mining pools work? To get to that number I did 1500 thash ([current network speed](http://bitcoin.sipa.be/)) devided by 50ghash (a butterfly miner in production) times $2000 (it's cost). Now this pretty wild, but it gives an indication of development costs. Obviously if you were a government you'd design a chip yourself. You'd need to get the project moving fast, and I'm not sure if the network could ignore a mining pool that was looking sinister. If each machine is mining 'lone' then you might well need even more miners, so that you could be sure that your 'push' would succeed. The hardware you made would then be redundant, so the $60m would be 'wasted'. I'm not sure how much the network could increase its capacity if it knew it was under threat, i'm not sure if people in the community might become suspicious of X Y and Z.

I don't even need to get into the why or wherefores of this, it simply says to me these are either markers for the bot to act upon, or they're micro bids filling the gaps between where the market (as you say) wants to be.  Or does it?  We've hung around $132-133 for the last however long when everything else says we should have come down.  Price slips a touch, bot kicks in and buys it back up a margin.  Theorising further I'd suggest this bot doesn't want to push the price any further up or it's going to start reducing it's already thin margin.  If anything it wants the price coming down to increase that margin.  As for physically shifting the market (the above withstanding) I think that's going to take a few days to spread out further in range, not that that's even necessary in actual fact.  The bot only has to work the price up and down as it's been doing, drawing out it's percentage.

However, I think about the nature of bitcoin and where it is in its technology adoption curve:\n\nhttp://tjm.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Crossing-the-Chasm.jpg\n\nI use this modified adoption curve, with the 'chasm' separating the early adopter from the early majority, because bitcoin is a *disruptive* technology.  People really have to alter their thinking and habits in order to make use of it - even to just buy it.  The chasm is a phenomenon described in the classic technology marketing book by Geoffrey A Moore:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_the_Chasm\n\nAnd I think the relative lull in activity from 2011 to to 2013 was a period of relative disillusionment, which seems like the chasm of bitcoin.  The hype spike of 2011 was caused by the unsustainable expectations of the innovators and early adopters.  But little by little confidence returned, and now the wider world is starting to see the merits of bitcoin.\n\nBut I believe bitcoin is a special case even when it comes to disruptive tech.  It's not a normal product or service being launched by a company with a limited marketing budget, but a protocol with a community of users who all become its proponents. Anyone who owns bitcoin has a vested interest in its success, so marketing is free and grows along with the community.\n\nOf course, all this is a theory of mine, and I might be utterly wrong.  Maybe we're still on a hype bubble, and we have the true chasm ahead of us.  But I'm taking my chances that this isn't the case.

These payment processor sites are extremely easy to use, with verification on bank accounts taking just 24 hours or so.\n\nAs for transferring bitcoins between wallets, one of the great things about the protocol is that it is not defined or restricted by geography when moving money.  I personally do not trade on btcchina, other than to buy coins and transfer immediately to another exchange.  Further, the exchange I do trade on now requires verification to deposit/withdraw $US dollars, so when I do eventually decide to pull anything from the exchange I can simply do it using BTC by transferring the coins back to btcchina without restriction, where I can then retrieve my cash.\n\nThere are currently no government controls regarding bitcoin, although they will undoubtedly be aware.

With disruptive technology (like bitcoin), it involves the very difficult task of bridging the 'chasm' between the early adopters and the early majority.\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/0ulZ0qn.jpg\n\nYou need to get each sector of the market on board before the next will consider it, and since each thinks in a different way, marketing to each of them requires different strategies.  \n\nIt's relatively easy to get the innovators and the early adopters convinced of the worthiness of promising new disruptive tech.  The innovators are basically the industry nerds, ie the engineers etc, who love new tech for its own sake.   The early adopters (or the 'visionaries') may not understand the nitty gritty of the tech, but they know innovators and respect their opinions, and may see the potential of how the new tech could be applied to the wider world.  \n\nBut the early majority (or the 'pragmatists') are much more conservative.  Unlike the late majority and laggards, they're curious about new developments, but they're not going to take risks on unproven tech.  They want to see it working and thriving in some field with parallels to their own before they take the plunge themselves.  So you need to capture a particular market before it will spread to others.  And this is the tricky part.  \n\nFortunately, bitcoin isn't a product made by a company with a limited marketing budget, but an open-source protocol with an enthusiastic community surrounding it, whose members all have a vested interest in its success.  Of course, bitcoin has already captured one market - Silk Road - but it's a highly problematic one, to say the least.  So until it finds its feet in an above-board market, bitcoin will be a tough sell to the skeptical layperson.  \n\nMy feeling is that the global remittance market is where bitcoin will really come into its own, and I'm keeping a close watch on this.  But with all the development underway by startups, who knows where will take off.": 1, ">1) bitcoin is very much, only speculative\n\nI'm pleased to see you've done this, hopefully it will generate some well thought out discussion on where the market as a whole might be headed longer term (though granted we've had a good degree of this already here).  I've thought about writing a 'what needs to happen' piece recently following some discussions with friends who were either not aware, or at best moderately, though to be honest the responses I often see to very fundamental concerns with bitcoin (mostly over at r/bitcoin, though it's evident here) lose themselves in stargazing.  I subsequently end up being sarcastic and provoking in an attempt to cut straight to the point, as this does at least fire people up enough into making more acutely motivated arguments and/or reasoning.  It doesn't however stop the Spartans hanging around, waiting to be impaled on bloody truths.\n\nAs a serious investment tool, let alone a rock solid transfer service, bitcoin is eons away.  As much as I might despise the banking system as a monopoly, it works.  Ethical considerations aside, it's a (relatively) safe bet I can take my plastic and pay for something instantly, or better yet be anywhere in the world and pull cash from the wall.  It's a system so well integrated we generally don't have to think about whether or not it works.\n\nI recently had a friend in the US try and transfer me some cash using bitcoin (I'm in China).  I gave him links to necessary sites, without giving him too much help, and sure enough within 30 minutes he messaged me along the lines of 'fuck this'.  The next day I received a wire into a Chinese account, no problem.\n\nPeople are creatures of habit, who for better or worse have been making the same decisions for centuries.  There is so much so very wrong with our current financial and economic systems, only a fool would think otherwise.  America has spent generations in a boom and bust economy, with generation after generation perpetually ready to pick up the pieces and put them back together again as before, hoping only that they can continue on the same trodden path once again.  We have distraction after distraction purposefully keeping us from making any fundamental differences to the way we do things.  This is very much by design.  Bitcoin is a threat of monolithic proportion to this delicately ordained balance of power, which doesn't leave it much room by way of integration or adoption.  Cries of revolution didn't do much for the Occupy movements, and I don't see them doing too much for bitcoin other than highlighting it's marginlisation.\n\nI do see a future for bitcoin, provided we continue to see major injection of venture capital coming into startups and infrastructure.  It's a technology with the potential to 'just work' in the same way EPOS works, only better, and if we can get to the point where bitcoin becomes a de facto standard in the money marketplace then this is all possible.  Until then we are a long long way off, left to our own devices dancing circles around that dirtiest of words, speculation.": 1, "> 'fuck this'\n\nmmm. \n> As much as I might despise the banking system\n\nHilariously, you're illustrating one of my points - that you have to be displeased with the status quo (banks etc), which I'm not sure too many people are...  \nI knew that bitcoin had a libertarian bent (I don't), but I didn't realise that I had anti-something and that drove me into it.

Sometimes I\'m amazed that more businesses don\'t see the value that BTC offers for them, especially when it\'s a company based on the internet.\n\nAs for the revenue figures, Bigpoint is still a privately owned company, so I couldn\'t find any formal financials either.  The few articles that actually dug deep enough didn\'t specify what their conversion rate from free customers to paying customers was averaging.  The closest I found was an article calling the paying customers "in the minority", which I already expected. They elaborated to say that the number of paying customers was "in the millions", and that the average monthly spend per paying customer was about $29.  \n\nSo that\'s a better figure to work with.  Assume 5 million paying customers (if that figure was as large as 10 million, I\'d assume the article would have said "in the 10\'s of millions" instead of "in the millions") at an average of $29 per month:   $145 Million in revenue/month, of which that money is split with the gaming developers (details of the split %\'s unknown, but also don\'t matter since we only care about the gross BTC spend increase).  I think $145 Million is an agressive estimate, so I\'m just going to round it down to $100 million in revenue each month from paying gamers.\n\nSo $100 million a month, and lets say they can convert 5% of those paying gamers into BTC paying gamers.  That\'s only an incremental gain of $5 Million a month in the BTC market.  In the past 24 hours alone, there have been about $150 million worth of BTC transactions.

As you say, it's the right kind of thing for bitcoin with the right kind of audience. Bitcoin might well allow them to do something new with their system (micropayments).

": 1, "I still don't aggree :D the $150 million worth of bitcoin transactions are not necessarly actually changing hands. \n\nSimple example: The payment api of blockchain.info allows you to create client facing addresses and transfer the incoming money automatically to an address owned by you. This service basically creates 2 transaction for every transaction.\n\nAlso it is not clear to me how a service can know which of the outputs of a transaction is actually the transfered amount and which of the ouputs did not change hands (but was transfered to a new address). \n\nLastly: a lot of transactions are gambling(satoshi dice). For every 100BTC bet, 1.9BTC (satoshi dice house edge) will change hands. The rest is just moving back and forth.": 1, 'Although I gotta say that, once you have the coins it is pretty easy to spend them. Bitpay works like a charm and I bought a few premium services with it': 6, 'Let\'s take a deeper look at some of those bullet points you mentioned.\n\n* 330 Million users:  Yes, they have a reported 330 million users, but their site is a "free-to-play" model.  Users don\'t have to purchase anything to play.  They would only purchase in game items if they desired.  So that 330 million figure should be scrapped, because many of those users will never purchase anything from Bigpoint.  To get a better idea of the potential market size of Bigpoint, you\'d need to have an idea of what their conversion rate is from casual customer to paying customer.  Also, that 330 million is every account thats ever been registered.  How many of those are still active is a question worth asking.\n\n* 5% Discount for BTC users:  Technically, this is actually a 5% *BONUS*.  Subtle difference from a discount, but important none the less.  The user still spends the same value of BTC as they would in a fiat transaction, but receives an additional 5% of in-game money/assets.  This is a very marginal bonus for Bigpoint to offer, and since it relieves them of pesky transaction fees, they make more marginal profit by encouraging the use of BTC.  However, for the end user, is the 5% really worth the extra work involved in utilizing BTC?  If the gamer is already using BTC, then that would be a pretty easy switch for them to make.  If the gamer is not using BTC already, then that\'s a whole new learning process they have to undertake.  Plus the gamer will end up paying transaction fees when purchasing the BTC (exchange fees commission %), and that can eat into that 5% bonus incentive.\n\n* $460 Million Investment:   Ok, so they had a good second round of investment capital raising in 2011.  They got that to develop a gaming company, not a BTC company.  That investment amount is not really applicable here.\n\n*  Exclusive license for Game of Thrones game:  The game is still in development...  No incremental BTC is going to come from that any time soon.\n\n* 1 Billion transasactons daily (in 2010):  What are those transactions, really?  They go into no details other than calling them "micro-transactions".  I\'m not familiar enough with Bigpoint to speculate here.\n\n*  All transactions are for virtual items/credits:  "Virtual items/Virtual Credits" does not translate to mean virtual currencies.  Those are in game credits, like shitty XBox Live Microsoft Points.  Sure, I guess you *could* call those currencies, but good luck trying to spend them anywhere other than bigpoint.  And I doubt you\'d be able to barter them either.  \n\n*  1 in 20000 conversion = # of BTC transactions would double:  Well, I\'m not going to bother checking the math because the outcome is not what you think anyway.  Those new transactions would be microtransactions.  Simply boosting the amount of transactions would not also boost the value of BTC.  In fact, it would really just serve to clog the blockchain up with millions of tiny transactions.  \n\n\nIn conclusion, I think you\'re thinking about BTC market penetration in the wrong way.  While Bigpoint\'s vigorous acceptance of Bitcoin as a payment model is a good sign for BTC, it really shouldn\'t have an effect on the BTC market as a whole.  The total market size already makes the marginal increase from Bigpoint a moot point.  For BTC value to rise on additional companies adopting BTC as a form of payment, it would need to be major internet companies like Amazon, Ebay, etc, where even a marginal switch of 0.5% of the customer base would have a dramatic effect on BTC value.\n': 7, 'You can make amazon purchases with Bitcoin...

This is one of the best markets for bitcoin - because bitcoin education will be much easier for someone who buys Xbox life points than the average user on amazon who knows how to use a credit card to buy books.\n\n**Edit:** You should not compare the market gains caused by Bigpoint adoption to the current Bitcoin market size of 1.5 billion, because the current market price is highly speculative and mostly based on the assumption of continuous growth & adoption in the future. Rather compare it to actual market use today (Bitpay & such). The actual market price will always include future prospects and that seems to be a factor of more than 10x.
