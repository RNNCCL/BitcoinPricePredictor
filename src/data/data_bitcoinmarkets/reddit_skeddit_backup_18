FN, UKIP, AfD etc. \n\nThe problem is they have to take away certain rights, sovereignity, to keep the show running which means pouring gasoline into the fire. \n\nNationalism is not dead in the EU, it is making a comeback that could easily shatter everything the EU has been working for in the past 50 years.\n\n\nEdit: Totally forgot bitcoin. If it comes down to a collapse there will be so much money looking for new investment forms, even if bitcoin only gets a small percentage of that money it will blow up way harder than it ever did before. There are trillions in danger when the Euro experiment fails.': -1, 'Take look at this:\nhttp://imgur.com/xQ7VCi2\n\nDoes it look like the place to go in case of fear?': 0, '"Buy when others are fearful and sell when others are greedy". It does exactly looks like place to go because Bitcoin has great fundamentals and is still functioning no matter what the price is.': 1, "Don't bet on a collapse of the Eurozone or the EU any time soon.  In fact, look for a power play by European Commission President Juncker to totally change the situation in Europe by the end of May.  As I wrote on another forum:\n\nI think the new Greek government's endgame is simply to buy any amount of time until after May, because by then European Commission President Juncker, in a show of power, will have destroyed any pretense of the Stability Pact having any teeth:\n\nhttp://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/jean-claude-juncker-poses-challenge-to-merkel-and-austerity-policies-a-1017505.html\n\n> He wanted to take the teeth out of the Stability Pact. The pact limits any new borrowing by governments in the euro zone to a maximum of 3 percent of gross domestic product. Juncker wants to change the rule into a non-binding benchmark and he is backed by both French President Fran\xc3\xa7ois Hollande and Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi ...\n\n> The European Commission is expected to make a decision at the beginning of March on whether Belgium, Italy and France will face sanctions for their excess budget deficits. It is also expected to assess reform efforts in those countries ...\n\n> In May, Juncker plans to present a paper on the reform of the economic and currency union together with European Parliament President Martin Schulz, European Central Bank Head Mario Draghi and European Council President Donald Tusk. It is widely accepted that the paper will plead for additional powers to be transferred to the EU level.\n\nThe results are preordained. Any sanctions for countries not obeying the terms of the Stability Pact are going to be totally neutered by end of this March, especially for the likes of countries such as France, Italy, and Belgium. Budgetery constraints or demands for reform are going to be thrown into the trashcan of history for the larger European countries. This will be aided by the quantitative easing of the ECB. In return the non-German allied larger countries will throw their support behind expanding the powers of Juncker's European Commission.\n\nBy the way, according to the above article, Juncker is advising Tsipras:\n\n> In many European capitals, officials were surprised that Tsipras' had suddenly found the ability to use the language of diplomacy. One person it didn't surprise, however, was Juncker, who had coordinated the statement with Tsipras.\n\nWhat I expect the new Greek government to be counting on is that once it becomes crystal clear by the end of May that austerity does not apply to the larger European countries, support for austerity in any country will collapse as a stampede starts for everyone to get their share of quantitative easing.\n": 13, ">This is the same as gold, do you consider gold not scarce?\n\nGold isn't all that scarce. It was when countries were on the gold standard. Now it's just a commodity, but a commodity owned ubiquitously. Bitcoin might be comparable, but < 0.1% of the usage of gold.\n\n> They remove human elements - isn't this valuable?\n\nSame reason they're vulnerable to attack. This isn't going to be more valuable to the very rich than a private bank on an island somewhere, and that's who we're talking about. Joe Everyman isn't even aware of bitcoin, and the math and magic only make it seem scary and like a ponzi scheme.\n\n> Wouldn't it be obvious someone was trying to hijack and then a fork is created?\n\nThen they get the fork. The only thing it would take to wipe out Bitcoin is a major world government putting funding toward it. They don't do that because bitcoin is small potatoes and more useful extant than extinct - and because hijacking the chain and stealing everything doesn't actually net any funds, again, the bitcoin to fiat conversion problem. A government that owns all the bitcoin owns no value.\n\n>I don't think you can compare Bitcoin to anything - only aspects of it\n\nAgreed. It's a very unique thing with extremely interesting properties. It has a lot of potential to grow -- I just disagree with OP's assertion that it'll grow due to a Eurozone collapse.": 1}, ('Bitcoin Trading Project Powered Up With A NXT Asset', 6): {'Great idea!

So selling for short term loss could give him the most benefit.\n\nI think his main risk however is that to claim that short term loss he has to wait 30 days before buying back. If the market goes higher than the current price, that subtracts from whatever tax loss he harvested by selling in the first place.\n\nThe right answer really depends on your financial position and running the numbers. I would talk to an accountant or tax specialist to have him run the numbers in a few scenarios to see which works out best for your specific situation... A lot of other factors impact the right answer here.\n\nOnce you get that answer, you know how much you would benefit by claiming the loss. You can then decide if that amount is worth waiting 30 days hoping the market doesn't move substantially against you erasing any benefit.\n\nAnother alternative is to double his position now, and on the 31st day sell the original amount he wants to claim as a loss. This way he still gets to harvest the tax loss, but he doesn't risk missing out on market growth. The cost here is increased exposure of course... If the market moved further downward, you now own twice as much of that depreciating asset, tho your tax loss claim is a bit larger.\n\nI am not an astronaut tho.

After settlement your position will NOT be automatically reopened, so if you want to continue to hold a position you need to manually make another trade in one of the active contracts.

Until bitcoin proponents realize this, the price will continue to bleed out.\n\nand then it will stop?\n\nI\'ve never personally believed in the groupthink that bitcoin is "the better paypal", because in most of the cases, it just isn\'t. And, against the grain of /r/bitcoin, I think it\'s ultimately not that important. At least I hope so, because, at least at the moment, it\'s more of a hassle to pay in bitcoin than to pay with other means, at least for purchases where being pseudonymous is not that important to you. Especially paying with BTC in a point-of-service transaction is outright cringeworthy. There was not much innovation in that field in the last 2 years, if there even was any.\n\nBitcoin is like a helicopter that wants to be a car. So now you\'ve got wheels on a helicopter. Yes it can still fly, but people are trying to sell it as a car, and a helicopter with wheels is a shit car.\n\nAnd no, I don\'t have a solution for this, I\'m just a shmuck myself. I do believe bitcoin could be a great store of value, if the value would be at least 100x lager, propably more. How it might get there without it being widely used as a payment system, I don\'t know. It\'s a bit like a step 1: collect underpants. Step 2:????? Step 3: Profit! - situation\n\nI do believe or at least hope there will be a lot of innovation in the coming years, so I\'ll keep bagholding. There are many many bright minds working on Bitcoin and with bitcoin at the moment, innovation takes time. If it\'s gone, it\'s gone, I don\'t really care. I\'m not overexposed.\n\n//edit: I lost my tain of thought somewhere in this post... my point is, if you have a helicopter, and want to sell it, don\'t make your argument about what a great car it is when it clearly isn\'t. You have to convince everybody how great flying would be. That is what "disruption" means, and Bitcoin has the capability to be totally disruptive.

I anticipate the possibility of testing $200 this week.\n\nWe often get caught up in creating \xe2\x80\x9creasons\xe2\x80\x9d for the bear trend but cold hard facts are that the rate of inflation is growing faster than user adoption. As you may already know, every 10 minutes 25 new Bitcoins are created ($5375). That\xe2\x80\x99s a total of 150 coins per hour ($32,100), which is a grand total of 3600 a day ($770,400). Now add that up over the course of a year and we get an annual inflation of 1,314,000 BTC ($281,196,000). That\xe2\x80\x99s a 9.5% increase in our current supply.\n\nWant to know what\xe2\x80\x99s been suppressing Bitcoin bull runs? Is it the infamous \xe2\x80\x9cbearwhale\xe2\x80\x9d that keeps hating on the markets or industrial ASIC mining operations that need to cash out at optimal prices to cover operating expenses? Bitcoin mining has become a highly centralized business that needs to cover expenses to stay in the game. It\xe2\x80\x99s not realistic to think that miners will simply hoard Bitcoins because electricity and hardware costs add up to a small fortune. Some miners will be constantly trickling a supply of selling pressure, while others will hold and dump when the price is optimal.  Our current 24 hour trading supply is 158,838. Well every month 108,000 new Bitcoins will flood these markets. Sometimes these floods can instantly double, triple or quadruple our 24 volume and crash the markets.\n\nNow imagine you were trading a stock and the company keeps diluting the supply by issuing out shares everyday. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure if that stock would maintain the confidence of long term investors.\n\nWe will only see another significant bull run or bubble when a new wave of \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin Mania\xe2\x80\x9d kicks in. The formula is very simple, user adoption (new buying pressure) must beat the rate of inflation for the prices to rise back up. Until that happens the markets will remain bearish.\n\nhttp://www.dailytradingprofits.com/3234/bitcoin-market-report-021015/': 24, "I'm publishing my trades. If you don't like it, then move on.

There was a common theme in that movie that "something wonderful" was going to happen.  I think we are near that point.  Something wonderful could happen soon.  Or something horrible.  \n\n\' Let me explain what has recently happened and then give you the thoughts on a big move, one way or the other.\n\nThe fast rise at the end of January was impressive and gave us hope, then we fell right back down.  It seems that Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s exchange was not a Saturn V taking us to the moon. \n\nAfter the pop up we came back down to the prior formation and we continue to oscillate up and down between 210-230.  We recently had a quick bump up and down, which has extended the formation into a pennant.  The lows seem to be rising which is good.  The formation is stretching out, so that indicates a pretty intensive break coming.\n\nHere is where it gets exciting.\n\n**Formation Counting Predictions**\n\nThe formation is getting wide.  Currently its 9 columns wide.  That is as wide as its been for several months.  That means the next move can be counted as going 9 boxes from the end of the breakout, whichever way that is.  From our current breakout points that indicates a move up to 275, which is the \xe2\x80\x9cunofficial\xe2\x80\x9d resistance line (the crappy rust colored line.  On the downside, we would be looking to go down to the 184-6 area.  \n\n\n**Box Counting Predictions**\n\nThe other way to look at potential break out moves is to look at the last time it \xe2\x80\x9cbroke\xe2\x80\x9d the formation.  On the upside we can look back 5 columns and count the height of that column: 25 boxes.  If we overlay that break out onto what would be the next X column, the predicted high is $340, which would reverse the trend to an upward bias and be a move of more than $100.  On the downside, the last breakdown was 37 boxes.  That was huge.  If we overlay that onto our current situation, we can predict a drip down to $138.  So if you are going to go short\xe2\x80\xa6starting setting a target price.\n\nSo, here is the trade if you have big balls and a strong risk tolerance:\n\nFor an upward move, save your powder until it moves into the breakout mode,.  That would be any price above $235.  Start looking for a reversal about $15 above that.  Ride it until it moves into a long pole (4 boxes above the breakout without a reversal).  If it turns unexpectedly be ready to move.  But do not get feinted out by a simple reversal.  Let it come back down halfway before bailing out.\n\nFor a downward turn, go short as soon as it breaks down.  Because it should go fast and hard.  Bail when you get nervous.\n\nKeep in mind using the formation count, the longer this bounces around without breaking out\xe2\x80\xa6the stronger the breakout will be when it comes.  The box count predictions will not change.\n\nGood luck.': 49, 'Bitcoin price be like .... http://i.imgur.com/o3u80l0.png': 5, 'Nice Pump': 1, "Messaging you on [**2015-03-12 11:50:00 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2015-03-12 11:50:00 UTC To Local Time) to remind you of [**this comment.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2vdr0a/daily_discussion_tuesday_february_10_2015/cogyarq)\n\n[**CLICK THIS LINK**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=[http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2vdr0a/daily_discussion_tuesday_february_10_2015/cogyarq]%0A%0ARemindMe!  30 days ) to send a PM to also be reminded and to reduce spam.\n\n_____\n\n[^([FAQs])](http://www.reddit.com/r/RemindMeBot/comments/24duzp/remindmebot_info/) ^| [^([Custom Reminder])](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBot&subject=Reminder&message=[LINK INSIDE SQUARE BRACKETS else default to FAQs]%0A%0ANOTE: Don't forget to add the time options after the command.%0A%0ARemindMe!) ^| [^([Feedback])](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=RemindMeBotWrangler&subject=Feedback) ^| [^([Code])](https://github.com/SIlver--/remindmebot-reddit)": 1, 'In retrospect, holding at 660 last summer was much cooler.

If it doesn't, then there's counterparty risk.\n\nIt's true, the blockchain introduces a delay that, while *on average* is targeted at 10 minutes, we've seen fluctuate fairly widely. As you've also probably observed, sometimes several blocks are mined within seconds of each other. Other times we can go 40 minutes or more without seeing any.\n\nIt's important to separate the concepts of latency from throughput. Block mining times affect latency, and Reggie's right: because latency is high, our swaps are not (yet) well suited to those who want to time trade entry with a precision of seconds rather than hours. Intra-day trading is about as fast as you want to go with the current version.\n\nHowever, as Reggie points out, there's still quite a lot of room to grow for throughput, and we don't have any immediate scalability concerns for the blockchain in that regard.\n\nWhile I can't get into specifics yet, we're looking into ways to bring down latency while minimizing counterparty risk.

So, if you have 50BTC and want to exchange that BTC for for USD exposure, you simply enter into swap contract paying BTC exposure and receiving USD exposure. When someone takes the other side of that contract the value trade is on until the swap expires or is unwound because one side exhausted their principal+collateral. We don't trade or exchange physical - at all.\n\nIf you wanted a more exotic currency exposure or currency pair exposure, you can pay your BTC exposure for USDEUR pair, or exchange your BTC exposure for TSLA stock exposure, Gold exposure, 30 yr Treasury exposure, or even lever the price movement of the deal 20x, 50x, 10x, 100x, or 1000x.\n\nAt the end of the swap, the winner gets their BTC+profits(in BTC)+ collateral returned to them net of fees and the loser gets the same net of losses & fees.\n\nI hope that answers your question, and if you have any more please feel free to ask them.

I want you to succeed, but only based on your merits, not because of your 'buzz'.  I may come across as harsh, but i am not here to make friends.  I work on my own small projects in the cryptocurrency space, but i can only acomplish so much.  In an effort to magnify my intent, i try to push the people and projects i feel have real potential with difficult questions and challenging feedback.  This is an exceptional set of opportunities; only exceptional performers will prevail in such a valuable yet volatile space.  Please take it for what it is worth, and then focus your energy where you see best.\n\nFirst, as an overview without combing through the details, it seems you are trying to achieve a decentralized marketplace more quickly and on a bigger scale than anyone else i know of if the financial exchange.  IMO, your nearest competitors are the NXT Secure Asset Exchange and the various private 'btc escrow' style swap spaces that have developed in various forums.  Please let me know if you feel either of these conclusions is incorrect.\n\nBut my overview immediately presents 3 obvious structural pitfalls, in ascending order of importance:\n*  Speed, is it a strength or liability?\n*  Scaling, is it going to help or hurt?\n*  Messaging, can the people who need you hear what you offer?\n\nSpeed is great if you can handle it.  Most can't.  Looking at your website, i would not have presented it to the public without putting in a few more days of use-testing and content.  This is an example of trying to be too quick to capture first mover advantage.  As someone else noted, your website is basically a blog with a few content placeholders and a spreadsheet to download.  On a simple micro level, i would point out that you are using light grey text and light blue headers on a white background.  How hard do you want to make it to read your site?  This is such a basic and fundamental design flaw that it actually reflects as a lack of professionalism.  I know that sounds harsh, but that is the theme of my feedback.\n\nScaling.  45,000 tickers.  That sounds impressive, except that you don't mention volume.  45,000 tickers x 0 volume = 0.  If this is such a great service, where is the track record of you(or others, or beta testers) using it?  Before you promise 45,000 tickers, you need to unit-test 45,000 tickers.   So either you just didn't mention your extensive unit testing (doubtful, we're both pretty verbose) or: 1) you are still at the vaporware stage, 2) you don't know what you are doing, or 3) you are abstracting onto another service.  Smart investors are going to demand an answer to these questions.  Not presenting these answers more clearly looks...unprofessional.\n\nMessaging.  Never use light grey text on white background.

Why choose a name for your **service** that is going to blend so easily into that vast white background of 1000's of shitcoins?  Your name is your first opportunity to present your brand, so why have 'Coin' in the name at all?  Next an image of a Casacius coin?

State your LA, monetization plan, and dependencies right up front.  Do not try to appear to be what you are not (or are not yet).\n* compartmentalize your message, and design your website to reflect this structure.  Think about the people who you want to help, and separate their most obvious questions into a detailed FAQ  Separate that into sections.  Give each section a clear headline and a clear submessage.  Don't even go public until you have achieved this basic planning step.  Then build a website that is so good at delivering that same info that the users never even need the FAQ.\n\nRight now the first question on your FAQ (and again, the grey on white text, looks like you are trying to hide keywords in the 90s)  is 'How do i utilize the leverage feature on the app?'.

She could, at the end of every week, take 50% of the bitcoins she received that week, put them in her UltraCoin wallet, and commit them to one or more six month swaps where she receives US dollars in terms of BTC (USDBTC=X), or pays BTC in terms of US dollars (BTCUSD=X). As a sort of "hack" if one only wants exposure to one asset rather than two, one can use US dollars valued in US dollars (USDUSD=X, which is always 1.000) as a constant for the other asset.\n\nAfter several months, she would have rolling swaps insulating her from some of her exposure to Bitcoin volatility. For any given swap, if bitcoins go up in terms of US dollars, she takes a notional loss on her bitcoins. If they go down, she makes a notional gain. Either way, the portion of her wallet committed to those swaps doesn\'t lose value in terms of US dollars (minus the swap fees).\n\nShe could do the same for (paper) gold:\nReceive: GLD (ETF valued in terms of USD)\nPay: BTCUSD=X (BTC in terms of USD)\n\nOr she could put some portion in GLD/BTCUSD=X swaps and some portion in USDBTC=X/USDUSD=X swaps, etc.\n\nThere are some very interesting trades out there. This isn\'t investment advice of course, but let\'s say you saw this and wanted to bet on rising oil prices or falling energy stock values. \n\nYou could receive ^SPGSCI and pay ^GSPE or ^NYE. Either way, you\'d likely be in the money for those trades if you entered sometime around the beginning of February (see here and here, although sometimes Yahoo\'s charting interface can be a bit flaky).\n\nWith leverage, it gets even more interesting. Let\'s say you had 1 BTC you wanted to invest, and wanted to engage in the oil/energy trade above, but also wanted to be insulated from BTC/USD volatility. You could place the following trades:\n\n* Trade 1:\nPrincipal 0.5 BTC\nReceive ^SPGSCI\nPay ^NYE\nLeverage 2x\n\n* Trade 2:\nPrincipal 0.5 BTC\nReceive USDBTC=X\nPay USDUSD=x\nLeverage 2x\n\nTrade 2 works to a point. If BTC in terms of USD rises a lot and very quickly, your entire position 0.5 BTC position could be wiped out, so there\'s a cliff that you have to be aware of. But in this scenario, a little of that pain would be absorbed if Trade 1 makes money, since the BTC gains for that trade would be worth that much more in terms of USD.\n\nThese are just some of the ways the UltraCoin app can be used to tackle hedging or arbitrage situations right now.

I\'ve often wondered about this and the degree to which it is actually a problem for bitcoin as an emerging decentralized technology. \n\nCentralized node operators (like exchanges) and decentralized operators (like individuals and other businesses) might have very different priorities. For example it could be in the best interest of a centralized operator to keep transaction throughput very low as it drives solutions onto their centralized, off blockchain solutions. \n\nYour argument is that, with a majority of users, the economic weight is with the centralized operators, and therefore miners will align with them. \n\nBut suppose the individual operators *didn\'t* follow along due to the political disagreement? Suppose for example a fork is introduced that solves the throughput problem (or some other issue that divides centralized and decentralized users)? \n\nWhat would happen then IMO is a true schism, with the network literally breaking into two chains. The decentralized "majority chain," with a majority of voters but potentially a minority of miners; and a centralized "minority chain," with likely a majority of miners but a minority of voters.\n\nYour argument rests on the assumption that centralized players control the economics. But then the question is: *would the centralized services hold together?* That\'s the question you have to game out. I don\'t have an easy answer for that. I\'m inclined to believe that they would not. But I\'d like to hear argument either way. \n\nGood discussion.

So full nodes have an equal vote. \n\nSuppose there's a change that miners hate but users demand. If the full nodes change and miners don't change (let's say they try to collude on an embargo of the change), the miners could be mining empty blocks or could discover that all their blocks are rejected. This also means that their mining reward would not be accepted by the nodes. Of course this means that a huge incentive exists for a miner to break the embargo and collect the entire block reward. \n\nTL;DR nodes should outnumber miners and can effectively force miners to accept changes they don't want. \n\nNodes are very powerful.

Many things from markets, to technology adoption, to bacteria colonies follow an [s curve](http://www.pleacher.com/mp/mlessons/calculus/s.html) pattern. In the early days, you can easily plot an exponential function with high r - and this is true for many things. Obviously the price cannot rise *exponentially* forever, though. My (very broad) prediction is that one of the two scenarios happens:\n\n1. bitcoin becomes an established currency and will follow an s curve pattern where the price stops growing exponentially and only slowly goes up as deflation happens\n2. it follows a [business life cycle](http://i.imgur.com/a8YsiKA.gif) pattern where it will peak at a price, never recover, and slowly die off (and the big question is obviously *"has this already happened?!?!"*)\n\nI don\'t see anything else happening. In either scenario, though, we don\'t know where we are on the curve. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/xzjKIrl.png) or [here](http://i.imgur.com/QWXN8GZ.png)? After 10 years, we\'ll be able to brilliantly point out where we were. But from our perspective now, the part that can be fitted to an exponential growth curve could be over. Or not. There are arguments for and against this, but people who are convinced either way have the very real chance of just being completely wrong because reality don\'t curr.\n\nDo note that the picture of the business life cycle I included allows the possibility for the "business" to reinvent itself. An innovation that makes bitcoin massively useful can blow up a sluggish price again, restarting cycles.

First horizontally and then up as makers found shorts slow to close, hopeful of continuation, momentum ignition.\n\nThis is describing a short squeeze and it seems you're basing most your bull sentiment off short swap potential. OK, let's talk about that, since ofc there was some short squeezing going on.\n\nBack then BFX initial margin requirement was 40% (1:2.5), maintenance margin 12.5%. This results in a margin call at 31% move against base price. The lowest point of the dip on April 11 was $340. All those that sold the bottom there were squeezed and (at full margin) liquidated by the pop to $550 on April 15.\n\nOn the drift down afterwards into consolidation/plateau, the lowest point thereafter in that period was at $420.  Highest was bounce was $462, not even close to any liquidation danger zones. In fact, max margin liquidation of $420 is at $610+; coincidentally were that 40% big drop in short swaps occurred on May 30. In a nutshell, the rise that started on May 18 was the first one where anyone shorting the lowest point of the consolidation period got squeezed out. \n\nWhere are we today?\n\nWell, in our couple spikes up and down, the lowest we've been is those couple of trips down to $210. Currently BFX margin ratios are 30% initial margin, 15% margin req, so liquidation at 18% move against you at max 1:3.33 margin. For those who shorted max at bottom 210-215, this already happened at our last pop up to $268 (actually, that is *exactly* liquidation for max margin shorting $220).\n\nThere are a crapload of shorts here, true. But again, shorts have been flushed out already to $268, and to get any strong liquidation panic going, the squeeze would have to go a lot higher. For those who shorted $230 bottom at max, this is low $280s, for everyone else based around $240, this mid $290. \n\nI definitely see potential for a short squeeze and a little bounce, but I don't see it going any higher than our last one, $260 at best. And certainly not some rise to actually breaking our major downtrend, which is at upper $300s (boo at everyone using linear scale over trends with as big price changes as we've had)": 3, 'What about limit orders above/below market price so that part of it gets filled immediately, almost like a market order, and the rest remains as a limit order?

MATTHEWS\nFeb. 23, 2015 9:26 p.m. ET\n39 COMMENTS\nU.S. officials are investigating at least 10 major banks for possible rigging of precious-metals markets, even though European regulators dropped a similar probe after finding no evidence of wrongdoing, according to people close to the inquiries.\n\nProsecutors in the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s antitrust division are scrutinizing the price-setting process for gold, silver, platinum and palladium in London, while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has opened a civil investigation, these people said. The agencies have made initial requests for information, including a subpoena from the CFTC to HSBC Holdings PLC related to precious-metals trading, the bank said in its annual report Monday.\n\nHSBC also said the Justice Department sought documents related to the antitrust investigation in November. The two probes \xe2\x80\x9care at an early stage,\xe2\x80\x9d the bank added, saying it is cooperating with U.S. regulators.\n\nAlso under scrutiny are Bank of Nova Scotia , Barclays PLC, Credit Suisse Group AG , Deutsche Bank AG , Goldman Sachs Group Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., Soci\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 G\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9rale SA, Standard Bank Group Ltd. and UBS AG , according to one of the people close to the investigation.\n\nBank representatives declined to comment or couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be immediately reached. A CFTC spokesman declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for the Justice Department.\n\nThe precious-metals probes are the latest example of regulatory scrutiny into how the world\xe2\x80\x99s biggest financial institutions influence widely used benchmarks. Until last year, prices for gold, silver, platinum and palladium were set using a decades-old practice of once- or twice-a-day conference calls between a small group of banks. The process for setting each of the price \xe2\x80\x9cfixes\xe2\x80\x9d has since been overhauled.\n\nBenchmarks for the four precious metals affect jewelry prices and financial products such as exchange-traded funds. U.S. commercial banks regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency had $115.1 billion of precious metals-related contracts outstanding as of Sept. 30.\n\nPreviously launched investigations of the interest-rate and foreign-currency markets have led to billions of dollars in settlements from major financial firms. Related probes are continuing in the U.S. and Europe, with additional cases against firms and individuals by the Justice Department expected in the coming months, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nIn the interest-rate investigations, banks often reached settlements with U.S. and U.K. regulators, which made similar allegations of collusion in the rate-setting process. In contrast, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority and German financial watchdog BaFin reviewed the precious-metals benchmarks but closed their inquiries without finding evidence of wrongdoing, according to people familiar with those probes.\n\nRobert Hockett, a law professor at Cornell University, said it is \xe2\x80\x9cnot particularly surprising\xe2\x80\x9d that the Justice Department is plowing ahead despite the decision by European regulators. Recent scrutiny of big banks\xe2\x80\x99 operations in the physical commodities markets and criticism of the Justice Department\xe2\x80\x99s financial-crisis track record make it \xe2\x80\x9cquite understandable\xe2\x80\x9d that the agency would investigate allegations of precious metals price-rigging.\n\nLast year, the FCA fined Barclays \xc2\xa326 million ($40.2 million) for lax controls after one of its traders allegedly manipulated the gold fix at the expense of a client.\n\nThe bank said at the time that it regretted the situation that led to the settlement and has enhanced its controls. A Barclays spokesman declined further comment.\n\nSwiss regulator Finma settled last year allegations of foreign-currency manipulation with UBS. The regulator said it found \xe2\x80\x9cserious misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d among precious-metals traders at UBS, including \xe2\x80\x9cfront running,\xe2\x80\x9d or trading ahead of, the silver-fix orders of one client. A spokeswoman for UBS, which said at the time that it \xe2\x80\x9cinstituted significant cultural and compliance changes,\xe2\x80\x9d declined further comment.\n\nSome of the banks under scrutiny by the regulators are also fighting potential class-action lawsuits filed by investors, traders and other plaintiffs in a federal court in Manhattan.\n\nMore than 25 lawsuits have been filed against Barclays, Deutsche, HSBC, Bank of Nova Scotia and Soci\xc3\xa9t\xc3\xa9 G\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9rale over their alleged role in setting the gold fix. The plaintiffs are seeking damages for losses suffered due to the alleged manipulation of the price of the metal and gold derivatives. Law firm Berger & Montague, the court-appointed co-lead counsel for the proposed class-action suits, said the gold fix affected trillions of dollars worth of gold and related financial contracts.\n\nJewelry company Modern Settings LLC last year sued the firms that used to set the platinum and palladium fixes. The proposed class-action suit seeks unspecified damages from Goldman, HSBC, Standard Bank and BASF Metals Ltd, a unit of chemical giant BASF SE, for losses suffered from their alleged \xe2\x80\x9cnearly eight-year unlawful conspiracy to manipulate and rig\xe2\x80\x9d the metals benchmarks.\n\nThe banks and BASF are fighting the lawsuits.\n\nMeanwhile, the CFTC and Justice Department are pushing ahead with an investigation into another interest-rate benchmark, according to people familiar with the probe. Investigators are scrutinizing whether bank traders or brokers were involved in the potential manipulation of the ISDAfix, a measure used widely in areas such as setting payout rates on pension funds and determining the cost of real-estate loans.\n\nRepresentatives of the agencies declined to comment.': 13, 'Not all of us are enthusiastic about it.\n\n"It\'s almost as if reddit is composed of more than one person"... yadda yadda w/e.': 1, "I agree.

I sincerely apologize for the snarkiness up front (I was tired and grouchy answering the post with no sleep in the middle of the night, I\'m human too). Understand where it comes from though - and - on to a more layman friendly version of the answer, or at least a more verbose explanation of the answer (TL;DR, I will take some words to explain this, if you don\'t have the time to read it, we use a multiplier - if you do have the time, please read on). I was asked how the margin was supplied, and I answered digitally.  Many people in the financial industry doubt bitcoin and particularly blockchain related inventions because it differs from the perception of physically based financial entities in that bitcoin is primarily digital (although the currency and the vast amount of assets in physically based vehicles are primarily digital as well). When you go to your bank, and see your savings account with $800k in it, you are not looking at a vault with 800k pieces of paper in it, back by 800k little pieces of gold bullion or US military might units (guns). We all know that if we all went to the bank and asked for those pieces of paper, the bank will say no or collapse because the (actual asset-back) paper is not there or is there only in fractional amounts. This is known as fractional reserve banking. Anybody who deals primarily in major currencies deals with digital currencies and digital assets, and if you deal with money center banks you are dealing with digital loans, primarily "digital margin". How is that, you may ask?\n\nWell, when the Federal Reserve and the Treasury decided that the banking system needed more liquidity, they didn\'t go to the US mint and say, start making more quarters, nickels, dimes and dollars, they booted their computers and pushed a button that multiplied the money supply. They literally used a calculator and pushed the "X" button to put more "digital" money in the system. Of course that "new" "digital" "money" was backed by no more economic value than the smaller, older amount of money was so they essentially lowered the value of each dollar by adding more dollars (in numeric terms) to the system without a requisite increase in economic value to back said dollars, then took those new dollars (that were worth less per dollar) and sent them to failing banks to bail them out. The rub is, economically the banks weren\'t truly bailed out, they got more money that was worth less, so essentially were in the same position that they were in before...  BUT>>>>> The banks knew that most people and entities prefer to see the numbers and physical representations of value vs. the actual value itself, so they got away with the charade that is the multiplier effect. That\'s fractional reserve banking and Keynesian economic policy at its finest. \n\nWe, at Veritaseum do the same thing as the central banks do, add a multiplier to the money to give you a greater level of buying power - save for one big difference, and what I would like to consider a truly saving grave. Our digital money is finite and although it is infinitely multipliable, it is always backed by the same amount of economic value per unit. So, if we multiply your exposure of $10 by a factor of 10(x), you get $100 of buying power. If you lose that money for whatever reason, it is gone, taken by the counterparty that won the trade. We can print you more money by pushing that "X" button just like the Fed, but you have to put up more economic value (in terms of BTC, which freely floats against other currencies to measure and gauge the market\'s perception of its economic value). We don\'t create the (perception of) value out of thin air, we just create the credit and by virtue of the way the system is constructed, you are forced to back said credit with the requisite value of the proposed trade - UP FRONT. If you lever $10 by 10x you don\'t have to put $100 up front (you can put any amount you want up front - $10, $15, $100, even $1000) but you will have the trade closed out and unwound for you automatically by the server once you have exhausted your real value backing the digitally "printed" money that we supplied to you. Thus, if you put up $10, and levered it 10x, you now have $100 or buying power. If the underlying moves 10% in your favor you get a 100% return on your money. If it moves 30% in your favor, you still only get a 100% return on your money because your gains (and losses) are bounded by the economic value that you put up front. You can\'t make (or lose) more than you have to wager, you can make or lose it much faster though, by turning up the multiplier effect. So, if the underlying asset moved against you 10%, the server will unwind the trade automatically because your counterparty is no longer protected with real assets in case of default. With UltraCoin, you can NEVER have negative account equity, there can NEVER be a case of FXCM, LTCM or Man Financial.\n\nIf we let you make more money than economic value that you put up front, well... then we will be acting in the same vein as the central banks and money center banks, to eventually have the same effect, booms, busts, and crashes with counterparties getting crushed by entering into deals where the other side couldn\'t possible pay. Thing Bear Stearns (which I predicted their fall 3 months before the fact where Wall Street and ratings agencies still had buys and investment grade ratings - http://boombustblog.com/reggie-in-the-news/item/128, Lehman (predicted their fall months ahead of time as well http://boombustblog.com/reggie-in-the-news/item/154, WaMu (where I did the same), Man Financial, FXCM, etc. I actually know the global financial system rather well, so when I saw the potential of the bitcoin blockchain and a real application that could change the way financial transactions are done, folded up camp and jumped on it!\n\nThis new, blockchain-based, method of digital margin protects your counterparty from getting inflated dollars in lieu of real actual value despite the fact that you both entered the trade using "digitally printed money".\n\nI see this as the best of both world, the digital world and the physical world. Now, I could have answered the question simply by saying we use multipliers, but if I did then I\'m sure many would get the wrong impression and think that we\'re doing the same thing that the Fed or the Bank of England or the ECB does. We do, but we don\'t. I hope that fully answers your question, and if not, you know I\'m always here to have at it again.\n\n': 1}, ('CAVirtex Shutting down', 48): {"If you're going to say bitcoin started in 2009 because that's when it actually was first up and running, you can't then go and pick the earliest possible date for a precursor technology to the Internet.\n\nThe internet didn't even exist in 1982.
