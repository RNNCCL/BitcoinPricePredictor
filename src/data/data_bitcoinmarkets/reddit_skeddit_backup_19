Bitstamp has alternate intermediary banks that clients can use to transfer money to and from the exchange.\n\n<<<FULL TEXT>>>\n\nNEW YORK (InsideBitcoins) \xe2\x80\x94 On Wednesday, multiple Bitstamp traders were reporting delays related to their USD denominated deposits. Although there was originally no clear reason as to why these delays were taking place, it now appears that a culprit behind the deposit issues has been found. After reaching out to Bitstamp, Inside Bitcoins has learned that Standards Chartered Bank will no longer be processing bitcoin-related wire transfers.\n\n>US #Wires to #bitstamp #bouncing or remain #uncredited. Multiple Cutomers reporting problems with #bitstamp today.\n\n>\xe2\x80\x94 Scott Emick (@semick) February 4, 2015\n\nOfficial response from Bitstamp\n\nOnce reports of deposit delays starting popping up on Reddit and Twitter, we reached out to Bitstamp to get some clarity on the issue for their customers. At the time, Bitstamp was investigating the problem, and they didn\xe2\x80\x99t have much information to share with the media or their users. Today, Bitstamp provided Inside Bitcoins with the following statement related to the delays on USD denominated deposits:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe recently learned that an intermediary bank, Standards Chartered Bank, which is processing USD denominated transfers for one of our banks, appears to no longer be processing bitcoin-related wire transfers. As a result, those customers who have made a USD denominated wire transfer since Monday may have their deposits returned or experience a delay in posting to their accounts.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA temporary fix\n\nAlthough customers who made deposits earlier in the week may still be dealing with some issues, it appears that Bitstamp has found a temporary fix to their bank wire USD deposit issues. They expanded on their quick fix in the second half of their statement:\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose who make USD denominated wire transfers moving forward will need to specify the alternate intermediary bank provided on our deposit page until further notice. We are working to find a permanent solution. We appreciate your patience and support as the bitcoin ecosystem continues to evolve.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAlthough Bitstamp has found a bank to fill in for Standards Chartered Bank over the short term, they\xe2\x80\x99ll definitely need to find a new long term banking partner. Banking relationships have been an issue for bitcoin exchanges since their inception, and many former Mt. Gox customers will remember the long delays that plagued that defunct exchange for over a year. Bitcoin has been able to make strong leaps forward into the mainstream over the past few years, but it appears that some banks still think the potential benefits of the technology are not worth the risks.\n\nRocky start to the year for Bitstamp\n\n2015 hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been too kind to Bitstamp up to this point. The year started with a hacking incident that drained $5 million worth of bitcoin out of the exchange\xe2\x80\x99s hot wallet, but the company has been able to make a somewhat quick recovery thanks to a new partnership with BitGo. It will be interesting to see how Bitstamp can continue to compete as new American exchanges, such as Coinbase and Gemini, come online. Many bitcoin traders in the United States may decide that it could be wiser to stick with a locally regulated exchange. Both Coinbase and Gemini can offer FDIC insured USD deposits to their customers, which is one feature that will be hard for offshore exchanges, such as Bitstamp and Bitfinex, to match.\n\nAny Bitstamp customers with questions related to the USD bank wire issues can reach out to support@bitstamp.net.': 2}, ('Bitcoin price bullish thanks to BitLicense', 0): {'Wahhhhh!!!': 1, '[deleted]': -2, '?': 1, "So, basically, be prepared to buy at 175 if you're lucky.": 2, 'He does not like your story.

Bitcoin in its history absolutely loves to bounce high as hell from these kind of drops, every single huge drop like this if you bought it and held for 7 days you made huge returns.

The same problems exist right now with certificate signing and domain registration. Blockchain technologies will solve these problems, because information can now be directly represented as value (i.e. PoW). Companies will undoubtedly build proprietary blockchains with centralized trust. But where does that leave international affairs? For instance, why would a company in China trust a proprietary blockchain from a US company? Why trust something proprietary/unauditable/untrusted? Bitcoin has been benchmarked and brute force tested for 6 years, and has network trust that can be proven.\n\nUntil an alternative starts to outperform and outpace Bitcoin, services and apps will simply be built on top of Bitcoin.\n\n\nEdit: Hyperledger seems to be another one of those platforms that can represent anything from gold to oil to agriculture.

And I don\'t think bitcoin will "crash and burn" to zero this year.  \n\nFWIW, it also has had a lasting impact on other semi-related projects I\'m either advising or working on, so I do actually hope that there are successful entrepreneurs/developers in this space to in part to help validate whether or not the protocol has real world uses (maybe it doesn\'t?) and because it would help counterbalance all the scammers that continue to be attracted to it.\n\nWith that said, the /r/bitcoin community has created a Bingo Card list of unrealistic expectations (e.g., ending <insert every boogeyman imaginable>) that will likely create burnout and even disinterest from both the public and investor community.\n\nSpeaking of which, there are a number of other unannounced deals that are fairly large which I am aware of.  Whether that continues through the rest of the year, or whether any of the projects will ultimately be successful I don\'t think anyone can know for certain.

It excels at being un-fuck-with-able monetary protocol. It\'s not much of an improvement for payments over credit cards, on that I agree with you. Storing value and transferring value are very different functions though. Bitcoin is a commodity money, and it performs that value storing function exceptionally well, with regards to durability, scarcity, fungibility, security, and international adoptibility. This is why I\'m hype. I think you should read some [Nick Szabo](http://nakamotoinstitute.org/shelling-out/) and [Konrad S Graf](http://konradsgraf.com/storage/Commodity%20scarcity%20Bitcoin%20Graf%2017March2014.pdf) if you want to really understand where I\'m coming from.\n\nThe only *real* beef I have to pick with your analysis is that "Bitcoin consensus is expensive." Compared to the human cost in running the protocol of the legacy financial system, Bitcoin is absurdly cheap. It costs the same as a few hundred employees. And for that cost you get a universal, constant clearing system, instead of a fragmented, cleared once per weekday system.\n\nI like your blog, and I admire your data driven approach, rigor, and openness to being wrong.

It was not until the very end of July (about 6 weeks after that interview) that it became apparent there really was no silver bullet solution that would raise the hashrate/security.  And then AuxPOW was pushed forward as the solution.  I believe /u/ummjackson and /u/langer_hans can share other views on the choices/timeline.  I go into more depth on this issue of block rewards and altplatforms in Chapter 15 (https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/chainbook/The+Anatomy+of+a+Money-like+Informational+Commodity.pdf)\n\nSure, so again, I\'m not anti-Bitcoin.  If it solves a problem for you, have at it.

That\'s not to say I agree with existing policies either.  The things I am personally interested are projects that have learned from the Bitcoin experience and moved on to integrate some of the ideas and married them with say, financial services.  That\'s not to say these new projects will succeed and Bitcoin will "burn" (as Charles Stross might say).': 2, "The title of the original white paper, the abstract and section 1 all discuss Bitcoin's primary use as a method of payments (e.g., to bypass TTPs for online commerce).  It's also what has been the primary focus for a large number of startups this past year. \n\nFor example, before Venturescanner paywalled their stats, through October 2014, there were ~20 payment processors that had raised about $102 million (out of the ~$350 million VC raised by that point).  Thus I don't think I should ignore what has been a major focus for entrepreneurs and enthusiasts, as well as the original whitepaper/sales proposal.  Perhaps this trend will change, but so far the consumer adoption side has been empirically flat for at least a year.\n\nI don't think digital scarcity as done with Bitcoin is necessarily new (DigiCash, Beenz, Flooz were all technically scarce).  I also think the monetary policy is backwards, as Robert Sams and others have argued.  Obviously, we probably won't be able to convince one another of this on reddit, but we can chat via email or Skype if you'd like to talk more about this.\n\nI'm well aware of Nick Szabo, interviewed and quoted him in another book published last March (ofnumbers.com/the-guide).  Very smart guy and I don't think he necessarily agrees with me or endorses my views.\n\nBitcoin's consensus mechanism was designed to be expensive, otherwise it would be cheap to attack and re-write history/votes.  \n\nLastly, it is not comparable to the legacy financial system because the current Bitcoin protocol does not have the ability to provide similar services right now (e.g., issuing credit, securitization, collateralization, mezzanine debt, etc.).  Perhaps one day it will, but this is not in the cards this year.

I always say there are smarter people than I and they can do well even in highly manipulated markets, by being super nimble. \n\nBut that doesn\'t change the fact that the BTC market is extremely manipulated by whales now and that wasn\'t always the case.\n\nAnd some of the manipulations are not for profit, such as the timing of the Marshals service selling the Silk Road coins. These are timed to hurt the BTC price as strategic times..otherwise they would announce the full schedule of when they plan to sell the rest of the BTC.': 5, 'First, "whales" as the term is used in the financial world, lose money as traders.  They lose money because they are "too big" for the market.  Traders make their money by exploiting the movement of whales.  For example, if a whale wants to buy 30,000 bitcoins, they will unavoidable push the market higher, which creates opportunities for smaller traders to front-run their orders.  That buy of 30,000 may ultimately prove highly profitable, but in the short-run it\'s an instant loser because of transaction costs and market impact.\n\nSecond, there\'s no evidence of what you\'re describing in most of these movements.  To successfully do what you\'re describing, a manipulator would need to identify moments when 10% of their size could move the market more than the other 90%.  For example, if I want to buy 30,000 BTC and the price is currently $200, it\'d be great if I could first sell 3000 BTC to push the price down to $160 and then buy 33,000 BTC at a lower price.  But obviously, most of the time, a buy of 33,000 BTC will have far greater impact than a sale of 3,000.  There are rare exceptions, and skilled manipulators can take advantage of those exceptions...but they are exceptions and they\'re obvious (at least as opportunities) in retrospect on charts because of high volume at extremes and very low volume leading to those extremes.\n\n': 1, "LOL\n\nedit: downvotes won't make bad traders' losses back :)": -7, "I think we're going to hit $100 within a month.\n\nThe new exchange is meaningless if there's no consumer adoption.": -3, 'The first thing that came to mind.

As the price got back over $200, people who missed their buys said, "damn, that might have been the only chance to buy <$200 ever, I better get whatever I can."  I was in that group; my target buy price was $170, but I was asleep when it got there so I bought a bunch for $195 when I got up, thinking I missed the chance to buy cheaper. So people like me chased the price higher.  Amateur shortsellers took stabs at selling it short as it rallied up through $240, and then when it kept going, they got margin called or stopped out, so it was probably mostly failed shortsellers who pushed it the last leg up over $300.  Of course at least a few of the buyers were also short-term speculative longs, more buyers chasing etc, but my guess was a lot of the last $40 of the rally were short-sellers covering.  \n  While manipulation can and does happen, it\'s actually really hard to profit from it if you\'re a whale.

Stating it's a lot of gambling and in the same breath stating you can do well over time introduces conflict that's difficult to logically resolve.\n\nIt's my opinion that gambling and bitcoin trading are equally worthwhile pursuits when engaged responsibly, as good as any other way that someone might like to have fun without hurting others. It is also my opinion that its best not to do something, while thinking that thing is not what you are actually doing. So ultimately I say that for those trading bitcoin they should be doing it for the risk and reward, and without any misconceptions about it.\n\nIt's a gamble and its fun, but there is extremely sparse grounds or history to support the notion that it's possible to continue doing well over time when actively trading through changing trends in markets over longer timescales.": 2, 'How did you decide to get into bitcoin?': 8, 'As a heavily invested hobbyist miner, with friends who are even more highly invested: you made the right move with your money.

If you let all of your BTC autorenew at the FRR (say, 0.0156% right now), then it sits for a long time (a day or more) in the queue waiting for its turn to be lent out, and even if you set the period to 14 or 30 days, it only stays out for however long the borrower wants it to, in my experience that's a combination of a few days and several hours. Then you go through the waiting period again.\nSo I turn notifications on for all my swaps, and when one is freed up, I renew it at the highest rate available with less than 100 BTC ahead of me, if the rate is low like it currently is, I keep my timeframes short as well. This way I keep the maximum amount of BTC at play during the day.\n\nRight now, very little swap is available, so if I miss a swap closing (overnight for example), they've been picked up by my FRR auto-renew pretty good the last several days, and whatever's left waiting in the morning I cancel and renew at the rate mentioned above.\n\nAlso bear in mind that although it's .015% right now (about 4.84% APR), just a couple weeks ago it was as high as 0.0493% per day, which is 15.29% APR! So on average, keeping my BTC in play has been somewhat profitable, much better than the 0.01% it looks like right now. But, due to counter-party risk I limit the amount of BTC I keep on the exchange, but if you can stomach the risk, and have 10 or so BTC to lend out, you can generate a healthy interest on your balance, even if you don't interact with your deposit as frequently as I manage mine.\n\nThat said, I'd take at least some of my BTC out of swaps, if I understand it properly anyway, and loan it out under /u/ibankbtc's master account if you set one up!

Or you don't and it fails because you didn't bother to know the variables or control them well enough.\n\nBut in Bitcoin, you can't know all the variables. Those you do know, you can't be sure you understand them fully, and you surely can't control them. You can research and attempt to prepare, but day trading on noise is a recipe for disaster for almost everyone on a long enough timeline.\n\nI am not saying my position is bullet proof. I would suggest we won't find many people in 20 years that have been day trading Bitcoin for that long.

Take note that you are using the term 'short' incorrectly. You simply sold some BTC. Going short refers to selling BTC that you have borrowed (via the margin trading function on bfx). The main difference is that if you are just selling BTC that you own you can sell up to the point that you have 0 exposure to BTC and 100% exposure to USD. Then if BTC decreases in value you are not making any money. May be you can buy more bitcoins later, but those bitcoins will be worth less in USD terms, which means there was no difference. If you borrow and short sell BTC you can actually get negative exposure. What this means is that when you close your trade, you can buy and return the bitcoins you borrowed at a lower price, and keep the remainder for yourself.

Yet the value of the dollar has hardly changed. You still buy roughly the same amount of gold for it."\n\n"That\'s because the economy is expanding at roughly the rate of inflation."\n\nNah, on both counts.\n\nThe reason that consumer price inflation has been low in spite of three rounds of QE is that QE has no transmission mechanism by which to increase wages and consumer prices. Under QE, the central bank is engaging in an asset swap with the private sector banking system (remember, even if QE acts on a non-bank, the transaction always functions through a banking intermediary).\n\nThe asset that the central bank swaps for T-bills, or MBS are banking system reserves. Reserves are officially counted as "base money," but are NOT "spendable" or "loanable" outside of the banking system (including the central bank).\n\nIn other words, if the CB buys a T-bill from Bank of America, what happens is that the CB\'s balance sheet grows by the size of the T-bill that they purchased. On the private sector side (Bank of America), the balance sheet does NOT grow. Rather, it changes composition -- now, BofA is less $x in T-bill assets, and up $x in their reserve balance they hold in their CB account.\n\nWe do, however, seem to have stock/asset price inflation, as big banks reach for yield. I don\'t think that is entirely QE, a lot of it is market forces. But certainly QE helped repair big bank balance sheets which has allowed them to pursue riskier investment opportunities\n\nOn the actual topic of Bitcoin, I have to say, I think the fact that you are both talking about BTC in terms of its value pretty perfectly describes the main problem Bitcoin faces as a form of money (as opposed to an asset). I\'m assuming we are all Americans. On a daily basis, how often do we talk about the "value" of the USD-denominated balances in our checking account? It almost never happens. Even when we talk about CPI we are looking at year-over-year change (if not longer) -- not thinking about daily values of the money we\'re using to pay our mortgage, gas up our cars, and go out for lunch. Unless you\'re a FX trader, it\'s not something people think about.\n\nMaybe put a more technical way, the USD has incredibly stable short-term purchasing power. Bitcoin, today, is quite the opposite. A good money has to have stable short-term purchasing power. You need to know that the balance in your checking account can buy your morning coffee just as effectively on Monday as it can on Friday.\n\nNow, please please don\'t mistake me. Bitcoin is NEW. I am not here to be a naysayer.

Seems like a great buy opportunity. What am I missing?', 9): {"In more developed markets like US equities, pretty much no one can predict future volatility very well.  The market using something called a GARCH model that's basically just a moving average that puts more weight on recent volatility.  In other words, our best guess for future volatility is an average of recent volatility and the long-term historical average.  In the S&P, long-term vol has been about 20.  If we have a month of vol at 10, my best guess for the following month might be something like 14, etc.  \n\nWith bitcoin it's hard to identify a long-term average.  Simply calculating the past 2 years of vol isn't necessarily a meaningful predictor.  Obviously the bitcoin market is changing a lot more in fundamental ways than US equities from year to year.  I'd suggest waiting for major extremes.  Like, I'd feel pretty good shorting any bitcoin vol contract over 150, maybe even over 120.  Under 50 it's obviously a steal.  ": 2, 'The BVOLG15 future expires on 27 February 2015 and will be settled at the price of the .BVOL index on that day. The .BVOL index is calculated each day over the previous 30 days of log returns.

If you are, then it will be legal.  If not, then yeah, you\'re creating an unregulated financial product.  Of course it\'s going to be illegal.\n\nAnd by the way, the product you are describing is really not very complex or unusual.  It\'s basically a straight up ETF, but you\'re just going to price it in BTC.  It really doesn\'t matter what you price it in though, because it\'s just a calculation of the value of the underlying assets (NAV).\n\n>*How to exchange the colored coins once issued\n\nDecide up front how much "1 share" of the ETF amounts to in a colored coin.  1 share = 1 coin would be the most logical.  After that, exchanging colored coins is basically the same as a transaction occuring at a bitcoin exchange.  User deposits BTC at the ETF exchange wallet.  User buys into the ETF, and receives colored coins equivalent to shares purchased.  Only full shares can be purchased, no divisibility. User holds the assets on the same exchange platform and sells them on the platform when he so chooses.  User receives equivalent amount of BTC back for the value of his shares upon sale, with the proceeds coming from the buyer or market maker.  Same sort of Blockchain ledger as any other implementation, in my opinion.\n\n>*How to enable publicly verifiable possession of underlying assets at all times\n\nHire a reputable third party trust to hold the underlying assets.  People respect reputable auditors.\n\n>*Should fees be assessed to cover administrative costs of ETF management (how to conventional ETFs manage this?)\n\nAbsolutely.  You will not survive without fees.  Launching this and maintaining it will not be free.  It will be very expensive.\n\n>*How to automate market making transactions, and how to track underlying asset value\n\nTracking the underlying asset value is not really a problem.  The underlying assets have real time quoted prices, and you know the number of shares held of each company within the underlying assets.  It\'s just a simple calculation.  However, if you wanted a true live calculation, you\'d need a Level 2 data feed from the exchanges where the underlying assets are traded.  Otherwise you\'ll have a small delay between the prices of the assets at their exchanges and what you\'re seeing in real time.  I think the latency is down to 5-10 seconds now so it\'s not an eternity, but high frequency traders would destroy your ETF before it got off the ground if they were able to calculate the expected price movements moments before your normal traders could.  Though I think once you got numerous HFTs trading against each other, this effect would negate itself.\n\nAutomating market transactions would just need a trading engine.  Can\'t help you there. I\'ve no experience building the guts of an exchange, just the trading methods.': 5, 'Bitshares does this. tl;dr: I can sell you the S&P500 index, oil, or anything else using purely crypto as long as I\'m willing to lock up a bunch of crypto as collateral. \n\n>How to exchange the colored coins once issued\n\nBuilt-in, trustless exchange between bitshares and bitassets, such bitSILVER on the bitshares blockchain.\n\n>How to enable publicly verifiable possession of underlying assets at all times\n\nThere is no possession of the underlying asset. The bitSILVER is short-sold into existence by someone who puts up cryptocurrency to serve as collateral. This is tricky so  you may  have to read it a few times:\n\nIf I have 60 bitshares worth 6 bitSILVER (at 10 BTS: 1 bitSILVER), I can short sell 2 bitSILVER to you for 20 BTS. \n\nWhy would you buy unbacked silver?\n\nBecause My remaining 40 BTS is locked up as collateral on the blockchain along with the 20 BTS you paid for it for a total of 60 BTS in collateral.\n\nIf bitSILVER doubles to 20 BTS: 1 bitSILVER then the short seller will be forced to use 40 BTS in collateral to buy your 2 bitSILVER.\n\n> Should fees be assessed to cover administrative costs of ETF management (how to conventional ETFs manage this?)\n\nFees are paid in transaction fees paid whenever the bitSILVER is bought, sold, or moved. Otherwise, it\'s free to just hold it. \n\n>How to automate market making transactions, and how to track underlying asset value\n\nPrice feeds of bitassets are supplied by "delegates" who are people that get paid partly through block rewards to maintain price feeds and process transactions. There are multiple price feeds supplied by multiple delegates. The median pricefeed is chosen. Delegates must pay a registration fee and can be voted out if they misbehave.\n\n': 3, "It's not stored on the software. Bitshares exist on the bitshares blockchain.

Going long with leverage is what you mean and it means borrowing money to buy more BTC than what you can afford with your funds.\n\nSo let's say you have $400 and the BTC price is $200, you will be able to buy 2BTC. If you go to an exchange that offers 2x leverage it means they will lend you another $400 and now you'll be able to  go long 4BTC (buy 4BTC) so now you have double the exposure to BTC swings.\n\nIf it goes up great you can keep your position open as long as you want, the exchange only cares that you're able to repay them their $400 loan and since you're making money you will. But remember they'll charge you some interest in the $400 you borrowed from them also this loans are short to mid term you'll have to renew it every 30 days (maximum loans on bitfinex for example), and the interest rate sometimes is expensive (it's determined by the demand of loans by the traders). So if BTC goes to $300 since you have 4BTC now you made $400 profit minus the interest rate from your loan, without leverage you would have made only $200 profit.\n\nNow, if it BTC goes down, the exchange closely monitors the price of your 4BTC position, they want the $400 loan back and if the price of those 4BTC combined is less than $400 they'll liquidate them (sell) to get their $400 back.

Whatever the price of coins does, you need to be able to re-pay $2X by selling your position. If the price went down by 1/3 (to $66) then coins that were initially worth $3X are now only worth $2X so you'd *only just barely* be able to pay back what you owe. \n\nFor safety's sake (to allow a buffer for slow execution and slippage to reduce the *actual* value of your position when sold, without threatening your ability to repay what you owe), the margin call comes sooner than that, when your net equity (the current dollar value of all the coins you bought, minus the amount you borrowed) is 15% of your position's value (the current value of all the coins you bought). Note: 15% is an arbitrary figure chosen by Bitfinex as the requirement to maintain a position.\n\nSo if the price started at $100, then for each coin you buy you'd need to put up $33 of your own, and take $67 of leverage. If the price fell to $78.8, you'd have a position worth $78.8 and leverage that's still $67 (the borrowed value is in dollars, so doesn't diminish as the price falls), hence a net value of $11.8, which is ~15% of $78.8 \n\nIn general: Margin call price = Initial Price \\* (1 - Initial Margin) / (1 - Maintenance Margin)\n\n***\n\n>But if it went up I could just leave it open as long as I wanted?

The penetration testing is of particular interest. I wouldn't mind internal auditing for transparent liquidity too. But this can raise the bar for some services.  I can't say how many times I've been worried sick about exchange security while moving large sums on and off for clients. Not to mention the various trade freezes. ": 2, 'For traders, this is negative.  Fees of exchanges based in New York will be raised to pass on the costs of these licenses to traders.  Traders will also have to be more diligent in keeping as little money as necessary in exchanges because exchanges will be more likely to freeze accounts and steal money.\n\nFor exchanges, who already have to apply for licenses in 50 states, this is neutral, because the requirements are stricter in some states.  The amount of data to be retained, for example, is the greatest of that required in any state, so if some part of these regulations falls short of what is required in another state, then it essentially has no effect on an exchange that operates everywhere.\n\nFor mining pools, who have thin profit margins, it is simply no longer possible to operate in New York.  Every legitimate pool will block IPs and people living in New York will be forced to solo mine when these regulations go into effect.\n\nFor miners, small miners in New York aren\'t going to be able to find trustworthy pools anymore and will have to shut down.  Big-time miners, if there are any located there, will be unaffected as long as they solo-mine.  Alternatively, there may still be anonymous shady pools based in eastern Europe that serve New York, but they will have high ping times and many rejected shares.  The regulations will cause mining in New York to become a dishonest business: honest people know they can\'t make a profit with the regulations and will leave, leaving only scammers and anonymous people who are willing to flaunt the law.\n\nFor banks, these regulations are a huge positive, as they have enough money to pay the application fee.  They already have all the people hired who do all these things.  They won\'t need to keep any more records or perform any more checks than they already do.  They don\'t have to worry about being prosecuted for bitcoin transactions, and they have an unfair advantage over little guys that they can seize.  Expect banks to flock to New York.\n\nFor altcoins, development will be pushed underground because it is nearly impossible to prove who released an altcoin.  Developing altcoin software is specifically excluded, as long as nobody can prove who "issued" the altcoin.  That means that there will be more altcoins with unknown origins and little improvement over existing coins, where there is pump-and-dump profit to be made.  That is compared to the current situation, where there are many of those coins, but at least people who genuinely want to try something new are encouraged to make money in a different manner.\n\nFor "bitcoin 2.0" blockchain services, this is a game-changer.  These businesses will have to leave New York because issuing tokens of any value can be construed as virtual currency.  Trying something out like NXT or Ethereum would require millions of dollars just to get the licenses required BEFORE they can start fundraising and developing.\n\n**Winners**:  banks(!!), big business, exchanges, those who can afford lawyers to withstand a prosecution to challenge the regulations, people who know Lawsky and can obtain one of the numerous exceptions that are highly discretionary\n\n**Losers**: mining pools(!!), miners(!), "bitcoin 2.0", traders (slightly), security of the network (because mining becomes slightly more centralized elsewhere)': 30, "Nah not really, latency isn't a problem if you just chose a VPN that has a server located near the mining pool servers.

I know that when the regulations go into effect, our pool will ban not only New York IPs, but also all known VPNs, so that we will be able to demonstrate to a court that we took all steps a reasonable person would do to prevent New Yorkers from using the service.  We will also create a policy that states that anyone determined to be associated with New York in any way will face immediate account closure, confiscation of all money earned without a refund, and a permanent ban.  This is serious business; the state is not large enough for us to take any risk whatsoever with New York and its laws.\n\nI believe that most pools will also ban VPN access.': 3, 'Of interest to heavy day-traders: Section 200.15(e)(2) requires licensees to report *any* person (anywhere in the world) who transact more than $10K in one day.': 16, "What are you talking about?

But only if their prudent and thoughtful instead of chalk full of conflicts of interests that amount to heavy handed tactics.\n\n Much the the New York regulations are acceptable, but some clearly are nothing less that retaliation by Bitcoin's competitors through attempts of stealth Redlining.
