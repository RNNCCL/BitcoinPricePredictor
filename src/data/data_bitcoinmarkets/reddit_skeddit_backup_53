Coinbase needs those features.': 1, 'It started off steady and measured but ended as a total circus of euphoria, followed by crashing back to earth once people realized the infrastructure (MtGox) just couldn\'t support the price. Depending on what perentage of your net worth you had invested, it ranged from exciting to life-changing during the bull run, then induced a crestfallen and often gut-wrenching feeling at the crash. All the normal sentiment cycle emotions happened. \n\nThe worst thing was that as many were sensing bubbliness and getting ready to sell, MtGox went haywire due to high traffic and coordinated DDoS attacks, resulting in blind trading as people panic dumped into an abyss and making the more calm people wonder if selling even made sense considering Gox might just close down or get hacked and lose everyone\'s money (as had been happening with other exchanges around that time). So even if you got the timing right - and this wasn\'t terribly hard (see below) - you still might have lost your chance to sell. It did all work out in the end, though, now, but many people had gotten comfortable with the idea that they were gonna be rich and ended up frittering away a lot of their coins at depressed prices to pay for lavish habits (or a quit job) they had taken on. Scams also increased for the same reason, as some people just couldn\'t give up on "being rich right now."\n\nThe signs of the top were easy to see for those watching the log chart: steady exponential growth of three-week doubling times for many weeks, then finally it went double-exponential. That is, it was moving as a straight-line slope on the log chart for many weeks, then it started curving upward on the log chart (like how exponential growth looks on a linear chart) - exponential growth of exponential growth. In other words, it was doubling every three weeks, then it started doubling the *rate at which* it was doubling - doubling every 10 days, then every 5 days, then every 2.5 days, then finally people realized the price would reach millions per coin within a day or two at that rate and asked what would happen there. Next day it crashed. \n\nLesson: exponential growth is good, but as it continues people see the pattern and pile in exponentially, causing double-exponential growth as seen on the "lilting upward" on the log chart. When it gets curvy on the log chart it\'s usually a good time to take some profits if you need to (paying for stuff, portfolio balancing), and it helps Bitcoin, too, because it helps cool the unsustainable double-exponential action. Also, often bad news will be blamed for the crashes at such times, but it\'s probably better to think of the extra-exponential surges as oversensitizing the market, so that it is just looking for any excuse to crash.

Nobody else\'s chips are yours. Your current balance is all that matters. New players more often get caught up in the reverse situation - they won half a buy-in, and start making poor decisions because "well I\'m just playing with my winnings". This is not a profitable mindset. If you sit down at the table with $1000 and ten hands later have $2000, you don\'t have your $1000 plus your winnings, you have $2000. You could step away from the table right now and go spend that $2000 somewhere. For some people, stepping away is a good decision, because being up a lot is too much of a distraction. I know there are online pros and semi-pros who have a "stop-gain" for this reason - they realize that they start making unprofitable decisions after winning a lot, and so force themselves to step away early after they hit their target for the session.\n\nIn the same vein, people get caught up in "winning back their money", when, in fact, it is not their money any more. A lot of people go on tilt (being placed into a poor psychological state by happenings at the tables) and start making bad decisions. Some people are the opposite - being in the red for a session is a motivator (high-stakes pro Ted Forrest is known to almost never leave the table when he\'s down). \n\nFundamentally, you can\'t let your current profit or loss change your decision-making at all. Good poker players develop a process and a strategy away from the tables, execute it at the tables, and then re-evaluate and improve it using new information. When you\'re playing, you don\'t even think about how many chips you have unless it\'s necessary to make a decision (effective stacks determine implied odds, and also ICM in tourneys).\n\nYou should approach investing decisions the same way. All that matters is that you have a profitable process and strategy for investing, that you execute it robotically, and that you re-evaluate and improve your strategy.

In this context, it\'s not when the price drops very temporarily and then immediately rises again.  \n\nNow, I\'ve already argued that the increase, drop, increase in price is almost assuredly a reflection of market inefficiencies.  This happened because people were cashing out because they\'d made a ton of money already and were scared, there is a buy-seller mismatch, there is a lot of noise, wild speculation.  \n\nBut, another way to look at it is to ask the question:  why did the price go back up immediately?\n\nThe reason this helps is a two steps.  First, the basic issue underlying a correction is that the asset is overvalued.  I won\'t go into how that is performed here.  But, if a seller or buyer determines that the investment is overvalued, people who own will try to sell to make an arbitrage over what they think the true valuation is and people who are buying won\'t agree to do so at the overvalued price.  So, the price drops.\n\nSecond, the price drops until it reaches a near equilibrium price.  If the market is anywhere close to efficient, it\'s not going to rise again until the market fundamentals change.  There are a ton of reasons those fundamentals can change, and again I\'m not going to go into any of them here.\n\nSo, the question is, why did bitcoin\'s price rise all over again?  Did the market fundamentals change?  The answer is no.  Some of the inefficiencies in the market that were blocking reaching an equilibrium price were cleared up.  This is true regardless of whether that equilibrium price was over or undervalued, or just based on wild speculation.': 3, 'Thank you so much. I just thought of something while watching clark moody.

However, I disagree that it\'s growing fast off of nothing but hype.  \n\nSee, since bitcoin has the ``supply\'\' part of the ``supply-and-demand\'\' equations all nicely curved and figured out, any change in price can essentially be attributed to change in demand. And most change in demand, regardless of the market, whether it is for Nikes or offshore oil rigs, boils down to hype.  So you aren\'t totally wrong.\n\nBut I hear a lot on this subreddit sentiments like "the price is too high, when we take into account what we can actually purchase with bitcoin!" But people forget that the infrastructure of the bitcoin economy is already there. In this instance, bitcoin represents a really cool mode of electronic money transfer (it\'s not just a currency, it\'s a payment system, after all). It\'s a highly sophisticated backend for an economic infrastructure. I think, ultimately, the market is sustaining people paying out the nose for coins due to the value of the technology as an infrastructure not so much it\'s capacity as a currency. Having said that, I think the real thing driving this bubble right now is the sheer number of eyes on bitcoin right now.\n\nAssume a small probability, p, that each new person who hears about bitcoin wants to get in on it. Their reason may be hype, sure, but I think in a lot of scenarios they are more likely interested in the ``economic infrastructure\'\' bitcoin represents. Some investors in China are interested in investing where a government can\'t seize your assets. Some people are interested in international trade, but don\'t have any USD or euro or can\'t get a paypal account or whatever to do it with. Heck, some folks may even want to send some money home from the US to China, or the US to Mexico, or from Germany to the Ukraine, or something completely mundane and hype-free like that. \n\nNow, consider how many people are just now hearing about bitcoin for the first time in China alone. The current rise in price isn\'t a matter of hype, it\'s a matter of sheer volume of people getting interested in the action. Even for a small probability p, if the state chinese television keeps broadcasting stories about bitcoin in the evenings, eventually you\'re going to get a heck of a lot of people interested in bitcoin.\n\nBack when e-mail or the telegraph were invented? They solved a problem that didn\'t exist before they had been invented. We didn\'t have too many mass transportation issues before the internal combustion engine.

They got popular off of ``hype\'\' alone, I suppose! After all, people were perfectly capable of getting along without the benefits of cars and telegraphs. And yet, they got popular, they served a need that was invisible before their existence, and once a critical mass of the population started using them, the cat was out of the proverbial bag and these technologies became indispensable to modern society.': 22, 'So if you have a set of meat curtains, mortgage your house?': 1, 'If your labia are longer than an 3/4 of an inch you buy.

Also, permanently lost/destroyed BTC remove from the total BTC pool.)\n\nSmallest meaningful unit of BTC exchange: 10 satoshi (.0000001 BTC). In the mature market, I\'d expect miners\' fees to be on the order of 1 satoshi. 10 satoshi as the smallest unit makes sense, as it keeps miners\' fees minuscule and keeps an extra decimal place for extremely price-sensitive transactions like large currency transactions.)\n\nPercent of M3 represented by BTC holdings: **???.** The first four figures are givens, unless you want to quibble with me that the end-state is $0.01 = 1 satoshi, in which case I would be more than happy to write an essay defending my views!\n\nThis is where the "likely wildly inaccurate" part comes in. I am going to arbitrarily choose **0.1% of M1** as the total value of BTC in existence - BTC\'s market cap.\n\nGiven our assumptions, 1 BTC = **$5306** in 2013 dollars\n\n*Things to consider:*\n\nSorry, Bitcoin fanatics, but reports of the impending death of fiat currency have been greatly exaggerated. I forecast that the main driver of BTC value is in its advantages as a medium of exchange: minimal transaction fees, cash-like properties, and resistance to things like capital controls and wildly optimistic official exchange rates in developing countries. In the optimistic case, Bitcoin becomes a market leader in both payment processing (replacing Paypal) and international money transfer/remittances (replacing Western Union and the massive hodge-podge of stuff going on in the developing world which I\'m going to categorize under *hawala*, and which is, incidentally, the market sector I project to be the first big leading adopter of Bitcoin).\n\nThe problem for my calculations is that the numbers are *very* hard to come by. For example, PayPal\'s revenue is projected to be about $6 billion this year, but that doesn\'t tell us anything - what we\'d need to know is how much cash PayPal\'s escrow accounts hold, which is not a number available to the public, as far as I can tell. If you\'re interested in a more rigorous analysis, I may be able to put something together based on looking at PayPal\'s financials. Or I may not. This shit is tough.\n\nOur scenario has a *big* problem:\n\nAssume that our scenario takes place "in a vacuum". Bitcoin\'s value is derived entirely from its efficiency as an intermediary in fiat currency transactions.\n\nSince the value of fiat is constantly decreasing and the value of Bitcoin is constant (because its use is constant), Bitcoin rises in value as fiat falls in value.\n\nIn an inflation panic or currency confidence event, investors move assets from fiat into Bitcoin, in order to hedge against inflation.\n\nCrypto-libertarians prematurely dance in the streets.\n\nBut if Bitcoin serves both as a hedge against inflation and a transaction intermediary, the intermediary portion suffers, as a rising BTC/fiat value threatens payment processors\' reserves (if you prefer to imagine a future without the Evil PayPal, it threatens consumers\' and sellers\' working BTC accounts; it doesn\'t really matter; if you actually believe the future of commerce is "my wallet direct to your wallet" then LOL YOU). BTC transactions suddenly become more expensive, even though they have inherent price advantages, because intermediaries must now account for additional currency risks.\n\nIt could be a game theory perfect storm; capital inflows into BTC drive BTC/fiat prices up, encouraging more capital inflows into BTC; meanwhile, BTC/fiat ratio increasing and BTC/fiat volatility increasing drives BTC payment processors\' competitive advantage over fiat/fiat payment processors down, essentially devaluing BTC\'s fundamentals. If the ratio of hedge investors is large enough, there will be a bubble in the now-mature BTC market, which threatens to both destroy legitimate economic activity (like payment processors) and confidence in the BTC markets.\n\n**Apologies if anything in this post makes no sense whatsoever.** I started typing, then I witnessed a crime, then I typed some more, then I gave a statement to the officer, then I typed some more, then I talked to my neighbors for an extended time, then I finished.

The real economy is the black markets and to a significantly lesser extent; gambling. \n\nThese single handedly guarantee Bitcoin will never return to zero. Why? Because, at least in the case of the black markets, they offer products and services denominated exclusively in Bitcoin. This means people who want those products and services will always be willing to cough up fiat to obtain Bitcoin and by association *spend* them. And that - ultimately - is the purpose of money; a fungible token of work done. \n\nReal businesses, real products and real services using Bitcoin *that's* what should (and will) define its value. Anything that increases the value artificially beyond these boundaries is hype and you should adjust your investment strategy accordingly.\n\n* Real news or hype may skew this upwards - say 250, otherwise it'll be a gradual decline as the Bitcoin baton is passed from one investor to another for less and less fiat each time.": 1, 'Oh I was going by Gox prices.

": 9, '"One more thing...it\'s been emotional." - Big Chris': 2, 'I don\'t know what the market is going to do anymore than anyone else, but here is my advice including some 20/20 hindsight.\n\nI first cashed out yesterday as China was making its bull run to 2600 cny, which ended up being around $350 usd.  I think bitcoin will continue to rise, exactly when and on what time scale I don\'t know, but what I do know is that markets are more about predicting how groups of people behave in stressful situations more than it is about technical analysis or discussions about fundamentals (which I also enjoy).\n\nNothing exists in a vacuum.  If you see a sudden, unbelievable rise in price in part of the market you can bet that people are going to react to that.  The exact reactions can be difficult to predict, and vary by market and situation.  We clearly saw Gox and Stamp do their best to keep pace with China, but just couldn\'t do it.  So we stalled, and China just got crazier, and we saw a pretty big dip.  Great for people who caught the bounce and sold high again, not so good for most other people.  Then we saw a second dip today that seems a little more serious in that it is not returning to the highs as quickly.  For those who caught the bounces right, it was a profitable two days, for others less so.\n\nWe\'ve seen the phrase "Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy" posted on here a lot.  This might be a reminder for some to listen to fear because 90% of posts look like people are mostly listening to their greed (hey, we\'ve all done that at least once and been bit).  Here\'s the thing, if you are trading on the fluctuations, you aren\'t going to buy at the bottom of the dips, or sell at the peaks, or at least not without a lot of luck.  You need to realize that you will have to make hard decisions, like buying while the price is falling, and selling while the price is rising.  Another option is to have trailing stop orders and then just let those manage it for you.  Or you can just buy and hold, but if that\'s the case you can ignore everything I\'m writing.\n\nAgain, I don\'t pretend to have a crystal ball, and I do make mistakes, but whenever I look back at my good decisions it was usually my caution and my fear that I have to thank more than my greed, and I maintain that fear and caution by being careful not to get caught up in group think, wild claims, and forcing myself to challenge my expectations and analysis.

You can set the periods to anything you wish.\n\nYou can have a simple moving average which is just a straight forward average, or an exponential moving average (EMA) which gives more weight to the more recent prices. What these do is allow you to identify trends. Many people use MA crossovers (when the lines cross) to trigger their trading because it indicates a trend change. For example, if the 10 period MA is higher than the 21, this means the price for the last ten periods has, on average, been higher than it has on average for the past twenty one. Meaning the price is trending up. If the lines then converge and the ten moves under, this means the more recent prices are trending down. The reverse also applies.\n\nHope that helps.
