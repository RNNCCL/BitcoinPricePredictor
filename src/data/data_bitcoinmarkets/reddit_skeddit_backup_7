Thanks for the great analysis, it\'s good to see users really getting serious about what they\'re trading.\n\nI\'m about to get on a plane so I\'ll keep it brief, but I\'ll talk shortly about inverse vs. quanto:\n\nInverse futures have some very interesting properties as well. For comparison, with a long on inverse futures (assuming $100/contract, OKC-style):\n\n* 1 Bitcoin @ $100, price doubles to $200. You now have 1.5 Bitcoin. Total USD value is $300, profit of 200%.\n* 1 Bitcoin @ $100, price halves to $50. You\'re broke - account equity is 0!\n\nIn a bullish market, quantos are far more profitable to trade.\n\nQuanto futures are more predictable than inverse futures (OKC-style) when calculating PNL in Bitcoin. The parabolic nature of quanto futures only comes into play when you calculate PNL in USD.\n\nThe reason a lot of it seems unintuitive is because just by holding Bitcoin, you\'re "long" Bitcoin. You make money without any trading at all if the price goes up. If you now start trading futures, you go even further long, and this is why profits explode on quantos on the way up.\n\nBut the simple truth of a quanto is that 2x price = 2x the Bitcoin, and 1/2 price = 1/2 the Bitcoin. This is easy to understand. But if you view it USD terms on a long: \n\n* 1 Bitcoin @ $100, price doubles, you now have 2 Bitcoin @ $200, Total USD value is $400, for a profit of 300%!\n* 1 Bitcoin @ $100, price halves, you now have 1/2 Bitcoin at $50. Total USD value is $25, for a loss of 75%.\n\nYes, they are better for longing than shorting, and this is why they usually trade with high premium. In the normal day-to-day swings that 24H and 7D see, the non-linear nature of quantos doesn\'t affect your PNL very much, but on monthly and quarterlies, it can be quite important.\n\nArthur will be online soon and I\'m sure he\'d love to talk more about these contracts and why it\'s important to have the choice in the exchange landscape. \n': 4, "It's more than that in USD terms, because Bitcoin itself has appreciated.

Use them in conjunction with candlestick or bar charts to determine the flow of supply and demand.\n* Analyze all timeframes, but remember higher timeframes always  trump lower. \n* Wean yourself off indicators. Use volume and how it relates to price action as your primary indicator. \n* Take a permanent leave of absence from trading forums and chat rooms. Tradingview, Bitcointalk, trollboxes of every kind--even Reddit. Close them all while you trade. Nobody has magical insider information to make you rich and if they did, they certainly wouldn't give it out there. Don't worry about missing out: If there is big news afoot, it will show up in the charts. \n* If you feel nervous or uncertain about a trade, get out. If the market behaves differently to your expectation after you make a trade, get out. If you can't sleep with an open position, reduce its size until you can. \n* Treat your trading capital like your family. If they were in danger or being injured, surely you would step in to intervene. Always use stops (real or mental) to cut your losing trades short. Respect the fact that they will save your butt when you are wrong (and you will be). Move them to breakeven on a winning trade. Never change or cancel them on a losing trade. If you are getting stopped out all the time, make better entry points (see next bullet).\n* Don't buy tops of long green candles. Don't sell the bottom of red ones.

Institutions are not interested in bitcoin. They are developing their own private blockchains, see R3 CEV Consortium. We\'ll be hearing a lot more about that in the future. They\'re even recruiting our own talent, e.g. Mike Hearn, so it won\'t just be a "me too" blockchain.\n\nWhy is this concerning? Well, many people invested in bitcoin were hoping it would one day become an interbank payment currency. That possibility is becoming increasingly unlikely. At least if they remain closed, they won\'t be able to steal *other* potential bitcoin markets, like international trade.\n\nWhich leads me to my next point.\n\n2. The bitcoin network is woefully inadequate. Yes the hashrate is astronomical, yes fortunes have been invested. But without the crown jewels of reserve currency/interbank trade/large scale international commerce making up the majority of the trades, the value may remain marginal. Why? Only something on the order of the current number of users can use it - occasionally - for anything useful. The capacity is almost exhaused. A few years ago when I first became involved in bitcoin, there was a general assumption among us plebs that the capacity issues would be dealt with in a timely manner when it became an issue. But LN/Sidechain stuff seems fanciful at best. Subscription based sidechains? Really? $20 on-chain transaction being applauded? Overhauls of all the major end user software people are using? The "obvious" solution of a blocksize increase is leading nowhere for reasons I have difficulty understanding. One could quickly conclude that a dead end has been reached, and if something isn\'t done quickly, bitcoin will be leapfrogged by something better.\n\n3. But what about high net worth individuals using it as a sort of off-shore banking alternative? Not very useful if they have to cash out to fiat on KYC/AML exchanges for everything - especially with the increased scrutiny these days from all the terrorist paranoia going around. So not many high net worth individuals are likely to invest without a network that can support many transactions, is accepted in many locations, and has strong privacy built in. Bitcoin is not there yet.\n\nStill I have some hope and am not selling. The commodity/gold 2.0 argument is still pretty solid IMO. It\'s funny how the "gold" part is becoming increasing true as the network capacity issues become more apparent: Not great as a currency, but potentially alright as a store of value.\n\nSomeone please tell me how I\'m wrong about everything.': 13, "The issue with the lightning network to me is pretty simple.  \n\nMaybe it will work, and maybe it won't.

The box plot is better, and a histogram would be ideal.\n\nIn both cases, you've run a one-way ANOVA and a C-S independence test. Why? What assumptions about the nature of the data did you validate before you did each test? It's possible that these were good choices, but unless you spell out the logic behind the test, this is going to be the biggest liability. For example, you mention the potential for skewness in the Wednesday set, but don't really address why that or the kurtosis (which is the bigger danger in return series) can be ignored to justify using the ANOVA. A one-way ANOVA is reasonably robust to non-normality so it's not a big deal, but a bigger issue you may run into is the serial correlation of returns within, and between, the samples. This is a problem that comes up a lot when you translate time series problems into general descriptive stat problems; in order for two neighboring price moves to be independent, some strong assumptions about the price generating process need to be made. The same problem can hit you when you categorize your continuous variable for the C-S; the power of the test can be distorted by the way you construct your groups so serially correlated returns can mean that you're not really getting an answer to the question you asked. So I wouldn't recommend a C-S test for independence here unless you want to analyze how the serial correlation itself could interfere with the test statistic (i.e. figure out how much predictive power the preceding day's direction has, regardless of what today is). You're probably best off using something for matched pairs.\n\nMore generally, I guess that the question that comes to mind when I see p-values in a situation like this is what the value of statistical significance is to you here. Why is a p-value important to you? And maybe to rephrase that, why is it important, in this case, to compute a test-statistic/null hypothesis significance test? Is there any decision that you would make differently vs. looking at a visualization of the raw data itself? Under what assumptions?

Also, the coins are fairly trackable. Suffice to say, if they ever starting moving coins to an exchange or something (and people watch this sorta thing), that would have to mean that's the end that entire business venture. More likely a 'strong hand' (as much as I hate how that word tends to be used around here).\n\n- If it's 1 anonymous winner, I see it as **neutral**, because they could do the above for some stealth project, but who knows what else they could do...maybe mess around with the market for great hilarity and profit (easier to do when you have lots of fiat AND btc). Dunno, nothing to go on.\n\n- In case it's a syndicate, I see that as **bearish**. Example being when the SM syndicate won, I see no coincidence that what followed was a pretty bad drop. Simple reasoning is this: If you are bidding as a syndicate member, that means you are most likely too small to bid on a single block (of 2K BTC) by yourself. Given current liquidity on exchanges, you could buy 2K BTC at spot directly and easily without moving market at all. There are regulated OTC markets that might have a slight premium but still offer safe ways to easily obtain that quantity of BTC. OK, so if you could get that BTC at spot price directly, why would you bid anything but notably lower than spot?  Following this series of assumptions a bunch of smaller bidders would now  have a bunch of BTC piles between them, priced lower than spot by a decent %. Would all of them resist urge to turn *immediate* profit? Would all of them trust others not to do so (some game theory there)? Even if they all held, what happens if market starts turning south?

It is great at taking out the noise in the system.  It is based on closing, high, and low figures from the day.\n\nThe chart is set up on a grid.  For every box move (the boxes have differing values as they go up) you move the column in that direction.  For example, in our current chart, if the high of the day exceeded $500 you would check the $500 box and the "pole of x\'s" would continue its climb.  Make your X and call it a day.  (The X is for columns going up.  O columns indicate a falling price.)\n\nIt does not look like we will hit $500 today.  So look at the low at the end of the day.  It hit $365 overnight.

This was a fuckup on our part, and our system health alerts have been improved to catch something like this immediately next time.\n- Yesterday morning our database server locked up and the other servers basically started to hang and not do anything. The system is obviously not fault tolerant enough and we're focusing on fixing that now. System health alerts were also updated to cover this in the future, so we will be aware of it within seconds.\n- Internet traffic to OKCoin China's API server is very unreliable. [It has been for quite a while](https://cryptowat.ch/news/okcoin-china-downtime-july-10-2015). Sometimes it's because OKCoin is being DDoS'd, but usually I believe it's bad networking from US to China. As a result, charts for okcoin/btccny & okcoin/ltccny have gaps in their data because of this packet loss. Our servers are in Dallas. We are looking into switching hosting providers and/or adding a server in a second data center somewhere in Asia, to hopefully fix this issue for good.\n- Bitfinex's websocket API has had a problem with it which caused its trade feed to fall behind by several minutes when a moment of high volume struck. As a result, our Bitfinex feeds were messed up a lot of the time this week. We have been working directly with them to debug & resolve this and this morning they claimed to have fixed it.\n\nI hope this helps clear up some questions.

Overnight we hit a low of $325 even.  That is the point of reversal down into a column of Os.  As you can see on the chart, it is shaded in grey as it will not be confirmed until the end of the day (7 PM EST USA).  If we rise above $345, this becomes moot and we would add a box in the column of Xs.  \n\nFor the point of this excercise, lets go along with a shift to a column of Os as it changes the target prices.\n\nAssuming this reversal remains intact throughout the day, the new Positive Break Out occurs at $350.  The Negative breakdown remains under $289.99. \n\nA reversal would occur right at under the break out.  THIS last point is very bullish in that the chart is tight (not much room on either side) and it indicates that the price did not dither too much befor moving up.  While not a sign of another "bubble" it could be the sign of significant upward pressure.  The ONLY thing to be aware of is as it moves above the break out point, watch out for the bear trap--which would occure two to three boxes above the breakout, and shoots down into a reversal quickly.    This is a bear trap on just about every other charting system.\n\n\nI have been reading with interest the whole "clawback" issue.  If I am reading it right, this short covering "pop" last night could have been related to that.  However, if that were the case the drop afterwards should have been more significant.  I still think it is amazing how they would claw back at the profits of people with good trades over those who made bad trades.  But...this is in China, right?  There are a lot of things about China that are a mystery to me.  What I do know is that China is huge.  So what they do, matters.\n\nPredictions:  I am thinking that today is going to be another bouncinhg day between our price points of $325-340.  These are not TARGETs.  I would be the most surprised person around to see it climb up over $350 today (which would make this entire post moot.)  A sudden drop doesn\'t seem to be in the cards either.  The bounce up from $325 surprised me (I guess I was burned enough in 2014 not to trust Bitcoin\'s movements.)\n\nOf course, Clif High\'s web bots are telling us that something is happening, bitcoin will rise up a third time to pass through the $408 price and then go higher.  He has also said silver would rise....about 50 times in the last year.  So, we take his thoughts with a grain of salt.  If you havent heard of Cliff, look him up.  His web bot stuff is cool and his predictions are eeirely accurate on social, political, and market stuff.  He was screaming about BTC when it was $5.  He turned me onto it, and I dilly dallied until it was in the $40s.  Can you imagine getting into this under $5?\n\nSo I think we continue in our consolidation for the next few days.\n\nThe key numbers for today are $350, which keeps the X Column going.  The other key number is $295 which breaks us down (by that time you should have figured it out!  ha ha.)\nI have the flu.  Did not take the shot.

We don't have an insurance fund because we don't need it, we don't have clawbacks.  \n\n>Why does OKCoin have an insurance fund? \n\nThey offer high leverage futures without any real way to get funds from customers if their account goes negative. So they need to take whatever amount the exchange lost from someone getting liquidated (and that order not filling) from the traders in profit. When a position is liquidated on OKCoin they use limit orders, this does not guarantee that the order is filled. If the order doesn't fill and the price moves away from it, the exchange still has to pay the winner, but isn't getting any more money from the loser so they have to divide this loss between all the winners. \n\nEx: I have a long position of 10btc that gets liquidated at $300, but the price is moving fast and the liquidation order doesn't fill. Price goes down to $250, now the exchange has incurred a loss of $500 (10btc * $50). We'll say the total profit on the exchange from all traders that week was $10,000, they would proportionally divide the $500 among the traders in profit (for this example we'll say they all had equal profit). Lets say there were 100 traders in profit $100 each (for a total of $10,000) they will take $5 from each, totaling $500 (the amount the exchange lost). So now each trader has $95 in profit instead of $100. If there are enough funds in the insurance fund, that would cover the loss, if it doesn't, you get clawback like what I explained above. \n\n": 9, 'They allow higher leverage to attract investors which results in more margin calls but also more profit if you are good with it thus leading to the liquidations when the price moves too much in crazy markets.

Many times a typical liquidation is larger than the total SUM of the entire orderbook. And liquidations like these are not rare when price is volatile. So if it were a market order it would clear the entire orderbook - causing cascading margin calls - which simply is not acceptable. Thus, they use limit orders, which have the downside of what Zane explained. ': 2, "They closed out a very small part  (200cny) of my winning position.

The high this morning hit $328.\n\nThere are a couple of things that are interesting about this.  The first is we did not break down as far as the chart told me it would.  Sure, the drop and bounce from $311 fit the pattern I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen discussed, but it did not go down as far.  That is a great thing.  It means that people are more committed than I figured they were.  \n\nAlso, with all of the stupid talk about terrorism using bitcoin I figured folks would run screaming from bitcoin in Europe, so as not to be considered a suspect.  No, I do not believe in little green men, but I do believe in the NSA.  Alternatively, there was a huge bust of a $62B underground bank in China.  It appears this \xe2\x80\x9cbank\xe2\x80\x9d was used to go around capital controls in China.  I know China is BIG, but if they are stopping these big underground banks some of that money may be finding its way into bitcoin\xe2\x80\x94which is a great tool for skipping through capital controls.  Just a thought.\n\nSo, here are the new numbers:  We need to exceed $345 to have a break out.  The interesting things to look at for this are that getting there is going to be very difficult.  If you look at the chart, there is a little diagonal line of \xe2\x80\x9cu\xe2\x80\x9ds.  That is resistance from there original start of this last run up in October.  We have seen ton of resistance at $334 and we need to break through that to get to $345.  That might take a couple of runs.  \n\nThe second thing about this break out potential is that it will be BIG.  The formation is six columns wide, and a break out that this point will be a triple top break out.  If this were a stock, this is one of the most bullish formations.  A triple top break out results in double digit percentage returns on average.  \n\nDO NOT confuse this triple top break out with a candlestick triple top that has a high failure rate.  The PnF triple top breakout represents an exhaustion on the sell side\xe2\x80\x94all of the people trying to dump out are through and the people looking to hold are not selling.  In PnF terms\xe2\x80\xa6this is a good thing.  The only thing better is a Catapualt, which would be a triple top followed by a double top.\n\nThe second reason a triple top breakout should be big is the width of the formation.  At six columns, the stock is clearly consolidating.  If it breaks out, the buy side pressure should be pretty significant.\n\nThere is a new Break Down figure as well.  It is down to anything under $315.  A break down at that point might take us down a few boxes, but I do not see a catastrophic sell off.  And\xe2\x80\xa6.I probably just jinxed myself.\n\nThe bad news is that while we are above the reversal trend\xe2\x80\x94and still an an uptrend, the space between the current price and the trend reversal has moved up another $10 to under $260.\n\nSo, the key for the weekend is $345.01.  Or $314.99.\n\nI finally got some cough syrup with Codeine.  My son-in-law tells me that is the basis for what a lot of rap stars drink.  It gives me hives, so that just confirms that I am THE whitest old guy alive.  So its back to cough drops.\n\nYes\xe2\x80\xa6..I know that was a micro aggression or a sort.  It was a joke.

In the past if you were in profit on contract X you were subject to that contracts clawback, now if you're in profit at all you're subject to clawback.

As lenders made more cash accessible to home buyers, more people bought more expensive housing, which increased the prices of housing. Because the housing prices increased, investments in housing looked sound, and more money was lent. With loans guaranteed by the government, and a general government-sponsored attitude of the positive nature of home ownership, prices and desire for homes both mounted, lending standards were lowered, and the housing market and the lenders investing in it both reacted reflexively to the biased perception that these actions would lead to continued economic gain.\n\n>Succinctly, Soros\xe2\x80\x99 theory of reflexivity is an exceedingly useful tool for evaluating the reactions of the economic market. It essentially refers to a circular relationship moving between cause and effect, with both affecting each other in a self-referencing economic symbiosis.

SE Asia, Latin America, and lesser Eurogroup members who may be faced with the possibility of exiting the Euro would begin moving into BTC en masse. after years of venture capital investment and development of bitcoin startups around the world, there is now infrastructure in place to facilitate this move.  \n  \nthe point is that in *this* rally, new classes of people may be brought into the bitcoin trade--a wider group outside of early adopters and speculators, who are less likely to collectively dump at some high point. bitcoin has been talked about for some time as the future reserve currency of the developing world and emerging markets--this could be the move where that begins to take shape. future retirees in developed economies with exposure to wildly overvalued stocks and dangerous credit positions may start looking for a safe haven for their savings, and, seeing the price of bitcoin skyrocketing, having heard about it for some years, and having safe avenues through which they can now invest, could be brought into the trade.  \n  \nso I don\'t think its automatic that we keep going up, suddenly hit some top, and then spend 15 months retracing like we saw after 2013. we shouldn\'t be prisoners to what we just witnessed for the last two years and presume it will repeat itself--the conditions, on a number of levels, are different this time, and I believe there\'s a real possibility this will be the phenomenal move that brings bitcoin more into the mainstream and ultimately brings it to a market cap where volatility will decrease.

I think if the conference somehow ends with both those things, Coinbase will back off.\n\nI have no faith in the Core Developers right now, so I tend to agree that nothing good is going to come out of the conference. I expect there to be a battle over this switch, and it appears that Coinbase is forming a lot of allies behind the scenes to gather as much consensus as possible. I think this is bearish for the period of time that this fight goes on, but once it\'s resolved I think it\'s very bullish. I\'m saving fiat right now in case the price plummets during such uncertainty.\n\n> If businessmen at Coinbase can somehow semi-unilaterally alter the consensus rules of the Bitcoin network, I think that would have a very negative impact on the price.\n\nThis statement doesn\'t make much sense to me. There\'s no way that Coinbase is going to get this done "semi-unilaterally" (whatever that means). It seems like the point of getting allies right now is to get as much of a consensus as possible. Sure, it might not be the 99% consensus that Core Developers want, but it will be a supermajority, and I don\'t think that\'s anything to really worry about as far as long term consensus is concerned. You will never get more than 75% of bitcoiners to agree on a protocol change unless they feel the change is in the best interest of Bitcoin. I\'m just fine with that. As the network grows, consensus becomes more difficult, and 99% becomes impossible. That being the case, Bitcoin needs a solution where a single entity can\'t prevent necessary changes. But the slippery slope argument is always "What\'s to prevent the maximum number of coins from changing to 30 Million?" The answer is always, "you\'ll never even get 51% of Bitcoiners to agree to that." And if for whatever reason you were able to get that much support, there\'d be a REALLY damn good reason for it, and it\'s an idea worth considering.\n\n> OpenBazaar, I\'m sorry to say, will be a dud.\n\nI don\'t know how you can say that with any degree of confidence.

I\'ve been trying to figure out why so many people here are continually bullish while I can read all of these thoughts and not be convinced at all.  I had an idea last night that perhaps it comes down to being "in the trenches" with bitcoin, rather than just trading at exchanges.\n\nFor many people here, their entire experience with bitcoin is with numbers on an exchange - and that\'s fine for some.  It\'s possible to participate in this market by signing up for an account, getting some money transferred to the exchange, buying bitcoins, and then clicking buy and sell over and over.  These actions just insert rows into an exchange\'s database.  The bitcoins never leave the exchange, so this type of trader never encounters any of the limitations of actually using the system.\n\nBut on the other hand, there are people who are trying to conduct business with bitcoins, and for those people, the view is quite different.  As a person who makes a living with cryptocurrencies, I struggle all the time with the bitcoin network and have started to prefer altcoins as a result of fundamental limitations of the bitcoin network.  Yesterday, we paid over 45 cents to pay out our customers - and the transaction didn\'t get confirmed for 10 hours.  That\'s up from 22 cents the day before.  In order for us to pay out our customers in a timely fashion, it would have cost us $4 per $800 transaction.  Meanwhile, I could get a checking account with unlimited checks down the street for just $75/year, which is cheaper than even the 45 cent payout fees.\n\nMeanwhile, exchanges are also delaying their own payouts; Cryptsy, which is usually prompt with its withdrawals, needed 20 hours to get us our bitcoins on Wednesday.  Litecoin payouts are executing in under 2 minutes.  Miners are noticing this; as you can see in the "payout coins owed" chart at https://prohashing.com/charts.html, the proportion of miners asking to be paid out in bitcoins has fallen by 10% over the past week - half of which are being replaced by litecoins.  More importantly, the "second generation" coins like NXT and Ethereum have doubled in payouts.  A hobbyist miner who owns a 20MH/s ASIC and requests to be paid in bitcoins every day is now losing 2% of his earnings to bitcoin transaction fees, which is in addition to the 5% fee we take.\n\nI fully agree with those who say that blockchain money can be worth $1m/coin.  But bitcoin, as it stands now, is not worth more than $500 or $1000 per coin, and the market was unable to sustain that valuation when blocks became bottlenecked.  It is not, and does not have the capability to become, a "worldwide reserve currency" with blocks of limited size.\n\nI understand that there are differing opinions on this issue, with merit to each.  However, in terms of pricing, I think people need to really use or program the system to truly understand that the bitcoin everyone is thinking about does not exist today.  Many people are losing money in these manias because they think that this is the time that bitcoin becomes that reserve currency, but it simply can\'t happen right now.\n\nIf you have only ever used exchanges for your trading, I encourage everyone to install Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin XT, send some money to it, and use your trading profits to buy something.

You are not way ahead of the game.\n\nIn time, if fees become a burden it will make competitors more attractive (as you say).  But also if Bitcoin is less decentralized then competitors will be more attractive.  Accordingly, if fees increase so much that Bitcoin is under material threat of losing its momentum in the race for the network effect, then it will become urgent to simply increase the block size (1.5 MB should do for the next year).  A small increase is not a serious threat to decentralization.  Hard Coding 8GB, as this goober suggests, is a ludicrous risk based on unnecessary assumptions about continued growth.\n\nThere may come a time when increasing the cap becomes urgent, but now is not that time.  And meanwhile there other solutions being developed that show promise to scale Bitcoin in a much more elegant way.  If these solutions prove no good, or if they aren't developed in time, then urgency may require bumping the cap.  Today is not that day.  Bitcoin is not under material threat of losing its dominance in the race for the network effect because ProHashing has to pay 45 cents.  The Economist is not talking about Litecoin.  WSJ is not talking about Litecoin.  Nobody gives a shit about Litecoin.\n\nSo while this is true, the best solution is to take the time scale Bitcoin in a way that maintains decentralization and destroys its competitors in usability.  Any simpleton can conclude that clumsily raise the block cap would add some scalability, but there are still 10-min confs; there is a huge data demand required.

I think the notion of Bitcoin Core devs are trying to cripple bitcoin is outrageous. They are determined to keep bitcoin secure and decentralized, and disagree with Mike that 8GB blocks is the best way to do that.

But the 1-day chart looks like a bubble that has already burst and is now just winding down and blowing off or slowly deleveraging and imploding. Seems like there was a lot of unexpected fighting in the $350-$390 area, but that was similar to yesterday and the $380-$450 area so from my perspective it seems like we are surely headed down. \n\nThe price is too high for the normal Bitcoin eco-system as it stands (it has disrupted LBC for example), and it ruins adoptions and actual use-cases; things like LocalBitcoins, peer-to-peer lending and all reliant systems.

So the longer this shit show goes on, the more it's actually hurting the normal user base that is not solely speculating and trading.\n\nI think it will be obvious on the next drop that this bubble is over, where I would start to expect long positions to rapidly start closing, exacerbating the sell-off much more. A bit earlier in the day shorts started opening around $350-360 and expected Finex or China Exchanges to dump sometime earlier. Personally I think the dump is just being delayed because those longs closing are going to slingshot the price downward pretty hard. With some of the back and forth we are seeing today, it will probably catch many off guard as if it were out of the blue. But all of the TA points to a drop. It's hard to believe the daily candle will end in green, maybe it will. But the pump lined up perfectly with the auction and I think right now the market is having a lot of people chase moon juice and China is pretty stubborn / reluctant to give it up as well.\n\nIn my opinion, the dump is imminent. Or just a matter of time. We have seen a lot of bull traps and it's been fun to ride them, but the order books are weak and you really gotta do a quick in and out if trading this. Personally, I think all signs point down, and anything up is FOMO hopes, dreams, tears and bag holders. The price needs to settle down into a $10-20 stable range like before so the eco-system around it can stabilize and the actual value built on-top can continue to materialize.

It\'s also pretty clear that the current spike that we have, while notable, doesn\'t compare to the prior two spikes.  \n\nThis is particularly true when we look at how high it rises from the baseline, as opposed to absolute rise.

": 0, "[I'm looking at the daily](https://www.coinigy.com/s/i/564bc6c5/)\n\nIf you're a longterm speculator, this could be a nice area to buy.\n\nWe have been in a sideways market all year between $200-300.  If we stay above $300 we have effectively moved out of that cycle and begin something new.  We were on target to remain in this cycle until the sharp rise the past few weeks which indicates a breakout.\n\nTo stay level-headed, I indicated the scenario of falling back into the cycle (red line).  *However,* I also marked the upcoming halving.  I don't see this scenario playing out.  Buyers may want in before the halving with the hope of future returns.  Old coins will more than likely continue to hodl, thus decreasing the supply, temporarily, while the demand accumulates. \n\nThe green line indicates more sideways movement in another area.  The ~$300s will now be support, while ~$500 becomes the resistance; another barrier and key-area throughout btc's history.  Again, with the upcoming halving and other pending good news, I see another scenario more likely...\n\nBitcoin remains on the rise, bouncing off the trend-line established by the previous sideways market... a launching pad if you will.  ~3 months leading up to the halving we could see it's next bubble.  During this a lot of old coins and longterm hodlers could dump and create a lot of volatility.  In the aftermath, ~$500 could be the new support - if we can take away anything from past bubbles.\n\nDuring the run up the past few weeks I sold @420 and bought back in @305.  I plan to hodl until the next run up for the halving, then I'll reassess my exit for upcoming volatility.\n\n**TL;DR** I'm bullish leading up to the halving.  This could be a good area to get in on for longer-term hodlrs and traders.": 7, 'It\'s not a completely unreasonable position to be a bear. If growth continues at the rate it has been for the last 24 hours then we\'ll be back at $500 by December. That rate of growth is unsustainable. So, a bear that\'s saying "This is going to pull back" is fairly reasonable. Also, if I sell now then I get to walk away with profit, but if I hold then I\'ll expose myself to risk. Taking profit now is a strong upside to being a bear.\n\nThat said, I don\'t think this rise is over yet either.': 4, 'SO FRUSTRATING.
