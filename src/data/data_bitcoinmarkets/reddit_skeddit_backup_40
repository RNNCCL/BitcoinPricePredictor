Open BTC withdraws on a very limited basis under the guise of testing and sell on the upswing on their market. This is to capture as much as their clients' fiat as possible so they can buy the more expensive but existing coins from other exchanges. \n\nUnfortunately, if Gox is missing the majority of their coins, they will need to up and down swing their exchange several times to capture as much fiat as possible.\n\nAgain, this is one hypothetical response to a situation that has neither been confirmed or denied.": 3, "Certainly new investors would jump in, but ultimately we're talking about a loss of money that otherwise would've been invested in btc.

These are the 2 things that explains exactly what is going on. You can trust me on this one, I have nailed every prediction I made since I started trading BTC. Check my history if you dont believe (I predicted $1000, I predicted the crash from $1200, I predicted mtgox fall, predicted exact prices on this fall, posted 1 day before the whole mtgox fiasco started asking people to SELL their coins at $820 like I did and buy back at $500 like I did, precicted priced under $200 in mtgox and so on) ': 1, "I believe there is a direct proportion of Mtgox's downturn reflected on all the USD-withdrawal-enabled exchanges.

If this happened, the price would spike in Gox and would find an equilibrium with the price in other exchanges. This would be "back to normal" .\n\nAfter today\xc2\xb4s announcement I am pretty much sure that they are insolvent, have all or most of their accounts frozen by authorities (US&Japanese+maybe others we dont know?), assets frozen due to lawsuits and they have started to settle in private with those who sued them first. There is definately money missing, when a business stalls withdrawals this is usually the reason. The thing is that if they are insolvent, it wont be an easy hit for the rest of Bitcoin, mainstream media will have this all over and the trust in BTC will be on the lowest, a recovery could take a long time  in my opinion. We will see soon anyways;  I have sold on profit those coins I bought at $500, because I think the price in bitstamp could go under $300 if we continue to see a drop in the mtgox price (something like $30 would cause a $400 or $300 in other exchanges).

They're buying coins off-market from whales, it won't shift the price. All those hotdog vendors accepting bitcoin? They're converting straight to fiat, it drops the price.\n\nI agree that those billions coming 'any day now' is quite unlikely and might not go with as much of an impact as some people think. But claiming that big amounts of bitcoin being traded off-market doesn't affect the price isn't correct. It doesn't matter where and how they are traded, the fact remains that a willing seller sold to a willing buyer, meaning that this supply was matched by demand. If there was no buyer, this supply would have found other ways to meet a demand. So this trade effectively prevents a part (or all) of those coins to end up on exchanges lowering the price).\n\nAlso, most people that I know that spend bitcoins purchase new ones to compensate for their spending. So the net effect is about zero, not negative.\n\nGox imploding will unlikely cause the price on other exchanges to tank to $200. It might cause a small dip, but most people in bitcoin are well aware of the situation with Gox, and the ones that would panic and sell on a Gox implosion have already sold (causing the price drop we see on other exchanges). If all of this Gox story only made the price drop from about 750 to 570, then I don't see it drop further to 200 any time soon (even if Gox implodes).\n\nGox not imploding could as well bring back some of the lost confidence and cause a price rise.

The simulations would need to factor in the rate and impact of news developments, changes in adoption, and so on. From the hundreds of runs you calculate the mean (which hopefully shows a trend) as well as a confidence interval, which would show the range of deviation from the mean that is likely to occur given some cut-off (often 95%). In ecology, such simulations are called "stochastic simulations" (no relation to the financial world\'s stochastics formula or stochastic RSI) and are often used to predict changes in animal populations over time given different disturbance regimes. They are also used for weather forecasting. But the same can be applied to markets.\n\nWhen you do such simulations, the usual result is that things start off looking OK, but further out in time, your confidence intervals get larger and larger. Now for bitcoin, where a single news development can have a huge impact, your confidence intervals even out to 24 hours probably will be pretty big.\n\nIf anybody bothered to do this, the spread over time would be so huge that the TA would probably be fairly useless for day-trading.

I just read a good article that [compares bitcoin to PayPal](http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/20/bitcoin-is-the-new-paypal/). I think the real key is that scammers and general buttholes will always go after the exploitable. The buffalo theory is strong here. The least protected will be pushed to the outside to be taken down, while the rest will remain strong.\n\nThat being said, I think most people assume that Gox will go under in some way. I think if people started pulling coins out and moving to other exchanges, there may be temporary dips if there was a true mass exodus, but I think it'll be countered with the mentality that bitcoin will certainly survive. Yes, some people might lose money or not be able to get out, but I don't think they're any less excited about bitcoin. Gox was just the weakest of the bunch, it got exploited, and it's going to die one way or the other. Just like PayPal, just because scams get executed under the umbrella of bitcoin doesn't mean that bitcoin itself will fold. We just need to let the weak exchanges die and the weak scams to prey on the weak. Every type of currency has these problems, and it's nothing new.\n\nThat got lengthy, so let me TL;DR: Bitcoin is still fine, confidence in bitcoin itself isn't shaken, still don't expect the price to tank below $450 worst case scenario.

It just seems that this sub forgets the cardinal rule of all economics: Humans are not rational consumers. Yet around here, TA is treated with the highest amount of respect while posts like this are looked down on. I think it\'s *extremely* important to remember how *people feel* about bitcoin. TA is great, and there\'s certainly a place for it, but it\'s also a little like statistics. Given the right parameters, you can get just about any story that you want. The framing changes constantly, and we could get wildly different stories about where it\'s headed.\n\nMost of the bitcoin moves haven\'t come at a surprise to me because the feeling has always been there. Sure, I won\'t say that I can predict where it will be in X days or anything, but when news comes out, I know where it\'s headed certainly. For right now, it seems that everything has pretty much been priced in. I expect the regular weekend slump that everyone feels, but apart from that I think we\'re ok. And if it dips lower, I feel it\'ll be temporary.\n\nUltimately, am I providing facts to back up my arguments? No. Not hard numbers or anything. I just think there\'s a large portion of **feel** that this sub misses out on. Having a pulse on how the general population feels about a particular topic is key. Even if the news outlets are writing unfounded FUD articles day in and day out... that\'s what the general population reads, so you should read it too.\n\ntl;dr TA is good on occasion, but it is highly manipulable, and IMO doesn\'t hold any more weight than how people feel about the market.': 0, "Thanks!

Gox may still be having issues, but no matter what the outcome turns out to be, Gox isn\'t going to be a major exchange anymore.

I think there are several reasons that the Bitcoin markets behave this way. \n\nFirst, most of the people involved in Bitcoin investing aren't traditional investors, or they have very little experience in traditional markets.  Good investors in traditional markets are looking for strong returns over the long term, and by long term I mean 10-20 years.  Average annual returns of 10% over 20 years would make you a god on wall street (and very wealthy).  10% return in Bitcoin? People want that in a single day.  The focus is completely skewed.\n\nCompound that with the fact that the market is unregulated, so shenanigans take place all the time, and now you've got excessive market volatility, which produces terrible behavioral investment decisions from undisciplined investors. \n\nAnd finally, there's a dearth of market fundamentals to analyze in order to come up with a price target over a longer term.  With a traditional stock, I can sit down and read their 10-K's & Q's, build a model on their financials, and come up with a value that I think the company will be worth in the future based on my own growth assumptions for the company.  You can't do that easily or correctly with bitcoin, so instead people rely on the recent events and news to drive the market price.  That creates a herd mentality.\n\nDo you ever wonder why there aren't a lot of people on here talking about a longer term view of BTC?  It's because the people who actually think in the long term like you're talking about don't even bother engaging in the short term minded discussions.  They are content waiting for the future to unfold because they are confident in the future of bitcoin.  And they know that their average annual returns over the long run will probably be far greater than 10%.": 30, 'Being confident long-term in immature protocol is ruthless madness...': 1, "I would think that the biggest flaw in TA is its inability to predict news developments. For that, you need insider knowledge. A single news development can swing the price massively up or down, and these days such announcements seem fairly regular. If it's not Gox going bonkers, it's some country forming laws and precendent, or some semi-big company deciding to accept bitcoin, or whatever.\n\nThis suggests to me that TA is most useful for day-trading on short time intervals (hours and minutes). For example, I use stoch RSI at the 5-minute scale for day trading, and I look at the 1-minute scale to see if sharp up/down movements have ended.

There is a massive amount of money tied up in Mt.Gox whether people admit it or not.\n\nUnless Mt.Gox is just stealing people\'s money (which is plausible), I would argue that they could be considered "too big to fail." They are the first major exchange and still have a decent amount of funds. It is in no one\'s interest for a major exchange to go down.

The banks are required to keep a certain amount of cash in their coffers, but if there was a run on the bank, they too would become insolvent. \n': 2, 'This.  Corporations were invented so that business owners and investors could avoid personal liability for actions of the corporation.  The impetus for corporations was to free up money for capital investment without burdening the investor with too much future uncertainty and risk, which would discourage capital investment.

And they make sense in the notion that a person who owns 1 share of Wal-Mart should not be personally liable if a Wal-Mart truck kills someone.  However, corporations can also be used as a shell game and abused if their primary function is to avoid debts, regulatory compliance or other obligations.  \n\nThis is easily illustrated by a one-man corporation:  Say I want to run a company, but don\'t want personal risk, so I form a corporation, djsjjd, inc.  I work online and have no employees and no one wants to buy any of my stock (no VC investors).  In larger companies, the corporate officers, the board of directors and shareholders are a system of checks and balances, which makes it more difficult for one person to run the corporation into the ground by malfeasance.\n\nIt\'s just me here at djsjjd, inc., So I vote myself to be CEO, CFO/Treasurer and Secretary.  I also vote myself to be the entire Board of Directors. This is a lot of work and responsibility, so I give myself a salary for performing these functions.  Then, I issue 1,000,000 shares of stock and give them all to me, so I\'m the 100% majority shareholder.  Next time I go on vacation, I deduct it as a business expense because the Board and Officers (me) decided the best place for the annual meeting was in Hawaii. \n\nAs /u/bassjoe wrote, Mt.Gox, Inc. can be insolvent as a result of spending all of its net profits on salaries and dividends, leaving just enough money in the operating account to pay for equipment and rent.\n\nThere is a lot of room for improvement in corporate law, as we have seen that corporations have proven unwilling to regulate themselves and are motivated solely by greed.  The only purpose of a corporation is to make money for its shareholders (which is why I think corporate hospitals are unconscionable. Your doctor may hope you get better, but management just wants the doctor to make your treatment profitable, which is a clear conflict of interest, imho).\n\nIn certain rare instances, you can sue the officers and/or directors in their individual capacities and attempt to "pierce the corporate veil" to get a shot at the business owner\'s personal assets.

This is false. Every time this nonsense is repeated (no offence to you personally) it helps us fall further and further into the fascist nightmare we call corporate globalization. Especially when combined with "they are here to stay" from your first paragraph, which I grant to be true.\n\nThe purpose of any corporation is clearly stated in its Charter. Generally it is to deliver a certain type of goods or services, to serve some co-coordinating social role, or in the case of certain corporations actually to "make money for its shareholders"; but to believe that all corporations do or must exist for this purpose is madness. Publicly traded companies take on some extra responsibility for handling shareholder money, but even then the investors should know that the primary purpose of the corporation is to carry on the business described in its Charter. The fact that it is profitable and sustaining is proof that the good or service being delivered is valuable, but profit is secondary to the valuable activity, not the activity itself. I like to think of it this way: Valuable goods and services are not a side effect of profit, but rather the other way around.\n\nWhile I\'m a big fan of letting people do as they please, when a chartered corporation puts other goals ahead of its stated one, when it acts contrary to the regulations of its business, or when its directors or agents commit criminal offences, then the charter needs to be revoked. This doesn\'t happen enough. A lot of corporate charters would end up being written so as to start with some vague profit-maximizing goal, and then describe the business in terms of how that goal will be reached - but at least then we\'d have some honesty to your claim that "The only purpose of a corporation is to make money for its shareholders". On the contraty, many corporations are founded by people with ideals and dreams who would not dare write, at the time of incorporation, that they are out to maximize shareholder value. When those founder-envisioned corporations get bought by one with the standard "profit all the things!" clause, there will be an obvious indicator that they\'ve gone to the dark side and we should watch them closely. When those profiteering zombies break the rules, as they so often do, we need to revoke the charter and ban the directors from participating in related business for a significant, if not permanent, period of time. \n\nON TOPIC: MTGox has at least a few employees and some office space. $17M might not go as far as you might think for a going concern of that size, especially if the desert coffees are really decadent. The BTC, on the other hand, that could be worth a lot, especially if the bulk of it was collected in the last year, I haven\'t seen any estimates of value-when-collected or guesses at previous cash outs, so it\'s hard to say how significant that is. I think OP\'s "I have to assume that they were keeping a very large chunk of that 275k BTC as an investment" is silly. Why of why would you have to assume that? My personal opinion is that they most likely got robbed by someone who milked the txid problems for awhile.

First, I would not use the term corporation as it is outdated, it is mostly used nowadays in propaganda documentaries but neglected by industry professionals and academics. Mt.Gox is an organization, or more precisely a limited liability company. The company is not public (not quoted  on any public exchange such as NASDAQ). The question is who really  owns the company? It would seem that Mark Karpeles ows >=51% of the business as otherwise the other shareholders would likely try to get him out of his role of CEO to change the business around. \nConsidering this statement: *Mt.Gox, Inc. can be insolvent as a result of spending all of its net profits on salaries and dividends, leaving just enough money in the operating account to pay for equipment and rent.*\nThis is just plainly wrong. Do you  even know what net profit is? You cannot take salaries out of net profit! In other words, the CEO receives a salary irrespective if he is shareholder or not, this salary is contractual and cannot be changed from month to month to fit one\xc2\xb4s needs. The profit can then be reinvested  in the company or distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends. This leaves no legal room for Mt.gox to touch customer deposits or even the bitcoins customers bought.

I think you misunderstood me': 2, '+accept': 2, 'First is to track down all insurance coverage (they have to give it to you in discovery - and they usually hand it right over because it makes it much easier for them if their ins. co. provides the money for lawyers and settlement/judgment).  \n\nHopefully, there is enough ins. coverage to cover your claim.  In the U.S., there are various regulations requiring a certain amount of coverage for different types of businesses to operate (just like your car).  I\'m not sure if that is the case in Japan, or if Gox is even incorporated in Japan.\n\nNext, I\'d go after the business assets.  Gox may be too stupid to have insurance, but they definitely have assets.  The blockchain provides a record of some of their activities and even people on Reddit have made detailed estimates of the fees they have been making.  If they haven\'t cashed out truckloads of USD and hidden it in the woods somewhere, the money is likely still in BTC or traceable USD.  \n\nOnce I obtain copies of Gox\'s hard drives, finding the BTC probably wouldn\'t be too difficult and I would have it put in the custody of the Court and held in trust/escrow pending outcome of the trial.  If it had been converted to fiat and placed in an account somewhere - same thing.  If Gox has vehicles or real property, I\'ll put liens on those pending trial, as well.\n\nHaving to pierce the veil is more common with small companies that don\'t have a controller, CFO, or even a competent office manager.  Also more common with cash businesses owned by people who like to pocket cash at the end of the night which, unlike BTC, is very difficult to trace.  You want to avoid it because it basically adds a second case to the one you are already bringing and can double the workload.\n\nBut the law gives you some interesting options to collect money once you have pierced the veil and obtained judgment.  The favorite of mine was a case my client had against a shady ex-felon strip-club owner.  Of course this guy didn\'t have insurance.  We went ahead anyway and won at trial.\n\nOf course when I seek to enforce my judgment, he claims his business is losing money and he can\'t pay.  (A lot of people don\'t realize that winning at trial sometimes is a wasted expense if your defendant can\'t afford to pay the judgment. All you get is a piece of paper that says defendant owes you the judgment amount - if you can\'t get it out of the defendant, there is nobody else who will pay it.)\n\nSince he owns a strip-club, which is a mostly cash business, he can claim he\'s not making enough money.  Since he was the "Owner/CEO," he didn\'t receive a regular paycheck, which meant I couldn\'t garnish his wages.  No problem - I sent a writ of execution to the Sheriff, and the Sheriff would pop into his club at random times and take all the cash out of the tills to give to me/my client.  The cops hated this guy and loved an excuse to enter his club at will to take his money.\n\nThis was kind of fun, but it was going to take years at that rate to get fully paid.  Fortunately, we got lucky when the defendant got busted for being an ex-felon in possession of firearms.  He made bail to await trial (funny how he had lots of money when he needed it).  He showed up for trial, but he didn\'t get his bail money back because I seized it out from under him.

Optimism is nice, I find my quality of life improved with an optimistic attitude... but sadly, I don't think MtGox deserves any at this point.

I agree that there are a few publicly-traded corps who are less aggressive about chasing only the dollar and spend some money on good causes.\n\nBut, imho, the vast majority of private corps that go public fit my description.

They just crave their keyboard commando rush.\n\nI made an oversight describing Mt.Gox as a corp, rather than an LLC.  This is a perfect example of *so what*? First, corps are not a dying breed (lol!) and S-corps can be structured identically to LLCs.  So, whether Gox is a corp or an LLC has no significance, other than their personal preference for tax structure or some other irrelevant issue that has nothing to do with the topic in this thread.  Even if it mattered, you are still wrong.\n\nCorporations are by no means a dying breed.  LLCs are also good options for some companies, but it depends upon what your company needs when it comes time to incorporate.

A greater majority of holders will be very quick to sell at any sign of weakness, and that will make the entire crypto currency economy suffer as a result.  You will no longer have a large number of early adopters willing to hold through any declines because the failure of bitcoin means that this new coin could fail too -- it will hugely affect peoples' confidence in any coin.  \n\nIn this way, any alt coin that is not pegged to the value of bitcoin actually does the bitcoin economy a disservice by competing, dissolving scarcity, and causing holders to pay more attention to what others are doing rather than simply having faith in the technology itself as many do now.": 7, 'Those four are debatable though': 1, 'No one said anything about government adoption...

There is no functional difference between a stock split and changing bitcoin denominations.  It\'s not making change because there is no "whole"  bitcoin to split.  They aren\'t individual items like stock shares.  The network doesn\'t log individual bitcoins, it keeps track of wallet amounts, which can be any decimal number.  The difference between bitcoin and a stock split is that the value of bitcoin rests solely in the investors\' minds.  Stocks follow the performance/sales of a company and its assets.\n\nYou have to split a stock so people aren\'t stuck having to a buy a single share at 100 grand.  You can\'t buy less than one share, so they have to be made cheaper to keep people buying.  You don\'t have to do this with bitcoin because it\'s already possible to buy in smaller increments.  In short, the stock has *already* been split, essentially infinitely, because it exists in non-integer amounts already.  The only question is how you talk about it.\n\nThe only thing that makes splitting a stock and *splitting* bitcoin different is that you still refer to stocks as single shares: *A* stock.  *A* share.  When we split bitcoin we call them millibits, or microbits.  If the value rose to the point that we decided we wanted to start *calling* millibits Bitcoins instead, there would suddenly be 1000 times as many just because we started saying there were, even though nothing had changed.  That\'s what happens in a stock split.  You now call a single share two shares, even though nothing has changed, and you do it so you can still sell "shares" instead of "half-shares."  Nobody cares about that with Bitcoins because the split is already built into both the protocol and the language.': 3, "And if that company was smart enough to take out a large position in Bitcoin or futures contracts before the announcement?

Not because BTC has infinite worth, but because when it becomes clear that BTC outclasses fiat currency in every conceivable way, the value of the dollar will approach zero. Currencies are in constant competition with each other. It is only government controls that have created the current equilibrium between fiat currencies. Bitcoin is beyond government controls.

The sell signal, with the new column is at $589.99.  We are still very, very close to the trend reversal point at $569.99.  \n\nA couple of days ago, someone asked me what was going to happen when that downward line of "+" and the upward "*" marks met.  Well, the downward +\'s are not "real."  They reflect the old upward resistance trend line from the previous high at $995.  The support marks *\'s are coming up from that low of $382 after the massive reversal back in December.  While their merger or convergence or whatever, is not a real point, I see it as an inflection point.  When those lines cross, it means there is no more up resistance, and no downward support.  So, it will go somewhere.  it would appear to be the "Mother of all Descending Triangles."  At least for now.  Either way it goes, it should move significantly.\n\nChart image at the link above.\n(3 day Bitstamp chart.

Previously, when everyone else was at $800 and Mt.Gox was at $1000, you *could* compute default probability. Here's how we'd go about it:\n\n1. Let x be the price of BTC/USD on Bitstamp. Let a > 1 be the premium factor for BTC on Mt.Gox, i.e. the price of BTC/USD there is ax.\n2. Since BTC flows in and out of Mt.Gox without issue, we know 1 BTC there is worth as much as 1 BTC anywhere else.\n3. Therefore, it must be USD on Mt.Gox which is worth less than USD on Bitstamp. The correct risk-neutral price of GoxUSD is 1/a USD, since (x BTC / 1 USD) / (ax BTC / 1 GoxUSD) = 1/a GoxUSD/USD.\n4. However, that does not necessarily imply a default probability of 1 - 1/a. If Mt.Gox is insolvent, you can probably still recover a part of your money. Let 0 < r < 1 be the recovery rate. We want expected value of a GoxUSD to be 1/a USD.

By default, I mean that when you try to withdraw your BTC or cash, you can't, because they don't actually have it.  A deposit, from the exchange's perspective, is a liability because they have to pay it back when you withdraw.\n\nYou could argue that the market implies a probability that Gox is bust and will default (screw you out of your BTC/USD when you try to withdraw) through the discount that currently exists on BTC at Gox.": 4, "Ok, next question, how do you trust the discount rate between Gox and Stamp?

": 2, 'Here is the biggest threat facing Bitcoin in short-, medium-, and long term: Supply and demand.\n\nIMHO, the demand for Bitcoin is almost peaked, and, even though the supply is increasing at a diminishing rate, I think the rate of mining will outstrip the need for new coins.\n\nIt has spread worldwide.  There are only a few parts of the world that haven\'t had their grand entrance to Bitcoin, and I think that a majority of the people that would ever use Bitcoin as an actual currency to buy stuff (actual Bitcoin consumers) have already bought in.  I understand that many people continually buy in -- more on this later.\n\nA large percentage of early Bitcoin adopters are speculators.  Either day traders, buy and hold-ers, or whatever.  They are trying to make a quick buck off of the market.  This is pretty clear, because of reactions people have when the price moves.\n\nAt the current rate of mining 25 per block, 6 blocks per hour, 24 hours a day, that\'s 3600 ~new~ Bitcoins being introduced daily.  For a price of $650 to be supported, $2.34M of new value has to be put into the market daily. \n\n[This chart](https://blockchain.info/charts/bitcoin-days-destroyed?showDataPoints=false&timespan=&show_header=true&daysAverageString=1&scale=0&address=) shows that a majority of Bitcoiners are just holding.  The massive amount of wallets and accounts people are making aren\'t actually meaning that the circulation of Bitcoin is increasing.  The huge peaks are centered around the bubbles and crashes, further illustrating that people are using Bitcoin to make money -- not to spend as money.\n\nEven most of the merchants who allow you "buy" with Bitcoins never actually receive Bitcoin.  They have a payment processor who pays them cash and immediately turns around and puts those coins back into the exchanges.  Essentially, a Bitcoin purchase never actually diminishes the available supply in the markets -- it increases it.\n\nI believe that in the (probably near-) future, Bitcoin will become deflationary.  This will scare off any speculators, which will compound the loss of value.  If this happens, the people who buy in regularly will make more money investing in index funds on the stock market than buying more Bitcoin, and they should do that instead.\n\n[But...](http://cdn.memegenerator.net/instances/400x/35298240.jpg)': 2, "I am most definitely NOT thinking clearly at the moment.

If the price wasn't high/low enough, then the rest of the transaction 'goes on the books'. To be actioned, when the price returns to that point. My point is, that the orderbook is stationary. it does not indicate movement. \n\nThat said, i am SURE that there is a wealth of information in the orderbook. I just don't yet know how to access it, an nobody on this forum has yet given me any insight.": 1, 'yeh well dependent on how many orders are on the other side of the book.': 1, "if i'm not mistaken, depth chart just maps out the order book.": 1, 'so that means if the green part is bigger then the price is likely to go up and vice versa ?': 1, 'Very insightful, thanks.': 1, '+1': 1, "Market depth varies by the distance from current market price. The relationship between depth chart and price movement is this:\n\nThe faster depth increases as you take steps away from the current market price, the more volume needed to move the price in that direction. The slower depth increases, the less volume needed.\n\nThe depth doesn't indicate what is likely or what isn't. It just indicates how much a certain volume of orders would affect the price, according to the current orderbook. If someone just made a huge buy, immediately after that order the depth for sells would likely look very deep - all the shallow part of the sell orderbook near the market rate was eaten up... That doesn't mean price is likely to increase further or faster. Shortly after that order the gap created between buy and sell orders will quickly fill in, and there will be a lot of shallowness in the depth chart until more orders are placed in the orderbook to fill that gap.\n\nExample: If there is less buy depth than sell depth, and someone sells 5000 BTC that will move the price farther than if someone were to buy 5000 BTC. When there is less depth, it means less volume is required in order to reach price points farther from the current market rate.\n\nIn that example, it may help to think about how large orders are placed. For example, if you wanted to buy 5000 BTC on Bitstamp right now, the market rate is $645 at the moment, but there are only a handful of coins available at that rate. So to buy 5000 BTC right now, you'd have to place an order at $710 or higher - this would eat up all the coins for sale at $645, $650, $675 and all the way up to $710 pretty much. You'd end up paying a total less than 5000 * $710 as many coins were available at less than that price, but you'd end up paying a lot more than 5000 * $645 too because your order was so large it has to go DEEPER into the orderbook in order to fill an order for 5000 BTC. However if the sell depth was greater, buying 5000 BTC would cost less, because there would be more sell orders in the orderbook closer to the current market rate.\n\nPrice moves quickly in 1 of 2 situations... Demand is very high to buy/sell, this can move the price quickly even if there is a lot of depth in the orderbook. Or no one really wants to buy/sell near the current market rate, this can move the price quickly because even small orders change the price as there isn't any volume in the orderbook near the market price.\n\nFinally, it is also important to understand the difference between buy and sell. A buy is any purchase made on sell orders currently in the orderbook. A sell is any purchase made on buy orders currently in the orderbook. People who are new sometimes forget that every sale on an exchange is also a purchase - one person gets bitcoin, someone else gives it...

": 1, "Anyone have a graph of the ratio of Bitstamp:MtGox sell prices?\n\nI wonder if that's would reveal a moving ratio of solvency guesses": 1, 'I get this weird feeling someone might end up hurting MagicalTux. And it will be all over the news': 1, 'You make a good point moderator. The "big sigh of relief" factor will weigh against the arbitrage factor. Which will have the largest magnitude?\n\nConsider first that there is some limited arbitrage going on with Mt.Gox already, through bitcoinbuilder. As I understand it, people are able to set up accounts in BTC or fiat there and trade it at a discount to Gox price. Then Gox holders are exchanging rights to their BTC in Gox for this outside BTC or cash.\n\nYou might be saying, "hey wait, where\'s the arbitrage?" But consider that these same people, obviously strongly bullish on BTC and risk-taking, would otherwise be using their fiat or BTC to buy into any price declines on the broader exchanges. So by not doing that, and instead funneling it into bitcoinbuilder, they are conducting an indirect arbitrage by not participating in (buying from) the Bitstamp/Bitfinex, BTC-e, or Huobi exhanges.\n\nHow much is this weighing into the current price changes? Maybe not much, but consider that people with the same mentality, non-Goxxers who hear that the Gox BTC floodgates are open, will at least in some part hold their current positions in anticipating of the Gox spike and concomitant BTC exodus from Gox. Simply the expectation of an influx of Gox BTC into the broader exchanges, even if the volumes are not that substantial (let\'s say "only" 10-20k BTC), will depress the price as potential market order buyers sit on the sidelines.\n\nOverall, I think you are right that the price dip will be temporary, but how temporary, and with what magnitude? Even if you think only 5000 BTC will be taken out of Gox and sold on the broader markets, that\'s enough to go $50-100 into most of the standing buy limit orders ("hidden orders" notwithstanding).\n\nSo we have 3 factors weighing against the "big sigh of relief". 1) Goxxers scrambling to arbitrage their BTC on the other exchanges, 2) Would-be buyers of BTC (non-Goxxers) sitting on the sidelines in anticipation of price decline from the arbitrage, and 3) So far not mentioned, the group of traders who are acting on TA in addition to the news. The last group will not be likely to "catch a falling knife."\n\nI believe group 1 will be discouraged from selling BTC on the broader exchanges only if the prices on the other exchanges equilibrate with Gox (let\'s say Gox goes from $100 to $400, and the exchanges fall from $550 to $400). The second group will be discouraged from buying BTC for at least 2-12 hours while the arbitrage effect from group 1 happens and the market "digests the news." And the third group will wait until the price is "just too good to pass up," and buy in hopes of catching the dip, or will wait for sideways action, reverse H&S, MA crossover, or some combination of TA to jump in. This third group\'s response will arguably be stretched out over the 12-48 hours post-announcement, depending on the magnitude of response from groups 1 and 2.\n\nThen, and only then, will the "big sigh of relief" be allowed to take over. And that\'s assuming, moreover, that bitcoin doesn\'t run into any other significant bad news in the meantime, or that the depressed prices don\'t cause faithful bitcoin adherents to abandon the bitcoin cause. Based on this reasoning, I don\'t believe we will see any kind of spike outside of Gox, if we see any at all, for at least 2-3 days. And looking back to the previous spikes and crashes, I believe we will see either a return to the linear trendline (putting prices on all exchanges from $200-400, depending on where you start), or else a collapse to near-zero if people begin to truly disbelieve in the fidelity of bitcoin.

I wanted a custom built machine, so instead of buying via eBay, I gave him $3000 in cash up front to build it for me.\n\nSome time later, he would tell me that one of the parts had been delayed, so he wasn\'t done with it yet. Then something had broken, so he had to re-order it. Then 9/11 happened, and his sister had been in New York, so he and his family were just too traumatized to deal with me. Then his kid was in the hospital, so he hadn\'t been able to work on it. Then his phone number changed, because he had been receiving harassing calls. Then he got mad at me for being so impatient and calling him a thief. Then he disappeared and I never saw my $3000 or a computer again.\n\nA few years ago I leased my house to a company that was providing it as a perk for one of their employees. They didn\'t pay the first months rent on time. They said there must have been some mix up at accounting, and would get it out right away. Then they said it was in the mail, overnight. Then they finally got it to me (via regular mail), but it was post dated to about a week out. When I deposited it anyway (it\'s illegal to post-date checks), it bounced. Then they told me that was some kind of pass-through account that they don\'t keep much money in, and it was my fault for not respecting the date on the check. They were late on rent repeatedly for the next 8 months, giving me all sorts of excuses, complaining about the late fees, going non-responsive, telling me they were waiting for a big check to come in, always saying "its almost there." I had to sue them and evict their employee and her family (who, incidentally, was hearing the same excuses I was, but about her paycheck).\n\nIn the first case, the man I was dealing with had aliases and a criminal record, and the only address I had for him was a post office box.\n\nIn the second case, the two main actors at the company were recently convicted of running a ponzi scheme which took millions from hapless investors.\n\nNow let me tell you about a Bitcoin exchange that started delaying USD withdrawals due to "bank issues", then virtually halted them altogether, then experienced a problem with the bitcoin protocol, then halted all withdrawals altogether, then changed their address, and occasionally pops up to assure everyone who gave them money that it will all be fixed... soon...\n\nIt just seems all too familiar to me.

Banks are paranoid about Bitcoin, and I can imagine they're especially paranoid about dealing with an exchange that had funds seized in the US.\n\nAnd worst case, if they're insolvent or become insolvent, it should only mean I take a haircut, not perhaps as big as the one the person who sold me gox coins took.\n": 17, 'muhuhuh put some coin on gox just to learn I couldn\'t get them out without being verified, took almost two months for that to happen, then it started to act funny.

I think that is where most of the confusion sets in.\n\nPoint and figure charts are trend trackers.  The fact that Bitcoin\'s changes direction every day is a function of bitcoin, not the chart technique.\n\nEach column is a short trend.  Short can be one day or in the cases of some stocks, weeks or even months.  It is the "current direction."  When that colmn exceeds the previous column in the same direction, it triggers a "signal."  The signal is indicative that the forces pushing the price has exceeded the limits of the last trend in that direction.\n\nLooking at today\'s chart we are in a short column of Os.  That means the short term trend is downward.  If this trend continues down through the $570 price point ($569.99) it will move into a box, one level lower than the previous low column.  This is called a "double bottom" breakdown.\n\nIn easy terms it means that in this particular "battle" between buyers and sellers, the sellers have won and the price is likely to go down more.  Sounds simple, doesn\'t it.  That\'s because it is.\n\nThese charts take a lot of the "noise" out of the market.  For example, since we are in a down column, if the price drops below $620 today...even if its just to $619.99 it will drop to a new, lower O box.  Even if the price shoots up to $1,000 today, because we moved down a box the chart for the period is over.  The move upwards would have to wait until the next chart  (in this case, Friday\'s chart.)\n\nOne the other hand, if the chart reversed up to $650without going down lower than $620, the next column of X\'s would be forming because the move upwards is MORE than three boxes in the opposite direction.  That is why this is labeled a 3 box reversal.\n\nWhen the next column of Xs exceeds $660, it will have exceeded the previous X column\'s height and it forms a double top breakout.  Again, this is usually followed by a higher high.\n\nMost of the estimated gains you might see on other charts (objective prices) are based on stock transactions.  Because bitcoin has no peer, it is difficult to translate estimated gains or losses based on the stock market historical prices.\n\nNow why are they called Buy and Sell Signals?  Because that is the side that has won the last "battle."  It is a Buy Column Confirmation Signal, or sell, but that is kind of long winded.\n\nThe names were made up long before I started this stuff.  Who am I to argue with history?\n\nGenerally, the only time that Buy or Sales are "allowed" using these charts are when the signals are triggered.  The only exceptions are long or tall pole warnings.  If a column has exceeded its previous column in the same direction by four boxes into the "sell" or "buy" area, it means that the asset is in "uncharted" area.  Think of a long pole standing alone in a field.  It is kind of easy to push over.  \n\nLook at the drop right after February 1st (the column with the "2" in the box.)  It dropped dramatically from 820 to 610.  That was a 16 box drop.  As soon as it dropped four boxes, you should start looking for a reversal back up.  We had to wait a bit--another 12 boxes.  When it starts to reverse up, if it is happening fast, keep an eye on it.  Once it reverses half way up, the changes for a full blown "bull trap" have passed and it might be safe to go back in.  Test the water as they say.\n\nThat call--the last time it happened (when it dropped below $630--the short term return was pretty good.  But I warn you....keep an eye and test the waters.  As Robert Downey Jr warned, "Never go full retard."  There is that time, once in a while, that it IS a Bull trap.  For goodness sake, that is not a time to buy and walk away for a week.\n\nThe same holds true when it is going up.  If it has shot up past the buy signal without retracing just a little, it might be a good time to short it.\n\nI am not a fan of shorting, but "thems da rules."\n\nAll of that said....read the resources.  See if you can find one, get a used copy of the Dorsey Wright book on Point and Figure Charting.  Or sign up at his site for a 21 day free trial.  The people there are great.  They don\'t do bitcoin (I don\'t think) but they are great at stock picking.  With stocks, there is a LOT more to it, in terms of the relative strength to its market group and to the S&P 500.  Those don\'t apply to bitcoin.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\n\nResources\n\nhttp://www.investorsintelligence.com/x/using_point_and_figure_charts.html\n\nhttp://www.marketedge.com/MarketEdge/DRME/drPFChart.aspx\n\nhttp://support.stockcharts.com/forums/30077/entries/21293\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nedit:  I dont type as fast as I think.\n': 18, "I think it will be more like coinbase where everyone can only withdrawl a fixed amount. \n\nBut I don't really think that maters much at all because nobody is going to sell the coins, they are going to hold them.

On the other hand, Forex can stay trendless for months, and is very dangerous and wild in a congestion. So up to now Bitcoin was a lot better for investing (buy and hold) while this tactics is not working now on Forex.\n\nDespite the differences, the set of skills needed is similar: discipline, keeping tight stops, letting profits run, not over-trading. However you need a lot of practice, and I mean a lot, to day trade Forex. It means sitting at the simulator (or trading very small account) for months or years (you really need hundreds of trades under you belt). I think trading is a skill (mostly) like playing guitar or playing poker. You need a lot of practice to 'feel' what to do.

The first bearish objective, based on the previous drop beyond a sell signal, indicated a low of $530.  The secondary bearish objective was $485.  This was based on a count of the formation width (11 columns) dropping from the "sell signal."\n\nI calculated this on Thursday, and neglected to post it on my chart that I uploaded Thursday afternoon.  Now, I look like I am making shit up after the fact.  But the methods are the methods.  This time the methods predicted the future to within a penny.  THAT does not happen often.\n\nInteresting to note that the formation now has a spread, triple bottom.  This bottom is indicated by the green bar along the $530 line.  A violation of this line would be dangerous.  It would reflect that the buy side would be exhausted.  Of course, breaking out to the upside from this point would be healthy, indicating that the "new bottom" is in place and the best way is "up."\n\nA week or so ago, someone noted the impending convergence of the support line up from $382 and the new downtrend line from $670.  That is going to happen around the $620 line in the coming days.  (Draw a line along the upward asterisk line and the downward "+" sign.  They converge in the next couple of columns.  I don\'t know what it means, but along with a triple bottom being set in, and the trend reversal line with sight, I am optimistic.\n\nI hope that some of you were able to capture the "pole" warning as the column of Os dropped more than four boxes, and then came rushing back.  I did not.\n\nI also want to apologize for sounding like a FUDer at the end of last week.  I saw danger in the charts, and I could not help myself from "editorializing" beyond the charts.  I am not a bitcoin "writer."  I will "control" my emotions better in the days to come.\n\nAnalysis\nIt looks good at this point.  The recovery from $530 looked good.  If we break upwards into a new formation, we will have put in a solid spread triple bottom which would indicate a new, stronger base from which we grow.  The caveat, of course, is the potential violation of that spread triple bottom--which would be a spread quadruple break down.  There are worse formations.  But not very many of them.

I hadn\'t thought of that. \n\nMy thoughts are that it will depend on the announcement.  If gox announces a full fix but with a "withdrawal queue" (the most likely outcome, in my opinion), gox price rises dramatically and very quickly since those who feel burned by gox in this whole debacle will buy coins to transfer them out - that is, until the price rises *above* that of the other exchanges, which is a very likely scenario.  At this point we will be right back where we were a couple of weeks ago with gox as much as 20% or higher than the other exchanges, and those with BTC on gox tempted to keep their coins on the exchange since the price is so much higher.  \n\nThere is also the possibility we will see the price rise rapidly *before* the formal announcement.  I am not one to speculate without some sort of evidence but in this case it seems possible and maybe probable that some will have advance notice of their announcement. My only evidence of this happening is the rapid fall we saw in the hour or so before the last announcement, which could have either been people speculating that nothing was fixed yet or some advance warning. But consider this; it would be a pretty smart move for Gox to have the price driven up *before* reinstating withdrawals, for the simple reason that people will be less likely to withdrawal coins because they are worth more on Gox than elsewhere. They are at risk of losing a lot of business here and this could be a solution.  Again we\'d be right back to where we were a couple of weeks ago.  \n\nFinally, if I were Karpeles, I\'d offer some major incentives to customers for all of this.

So they can "protect their customers from the government"? Come on, you can\'t be that naive.\n\nWell partly to protect the customer, yes, mainly because the customer is their source of long term revenue. Also so that they can protect them selves. That serves my interests too, because if somethign happens to the exchange operators, I\'ll likely get screwed as well. As long as they are selfish in the long term, it will benefit the customers too. It\'s not a zero sum game where someone must lose if another wins. \n\n> Not sure why you continue to attack my "political beliefs", which I haven\'t even made public here. The fact is, bitcoin will never, ever be the anonymous, government-free money that some would like. That is a complete fantasy. Sorry to disappoint you. \n\nHow was that an attack? All I\'m saying is there should be options to serve both your interests and mine. And bitcoin can already be anonymous, and has succeeded in that regard, so I\'m not sure what that is about. It\'s psuodo-anonymous, meaning it can be anonymous depending on how it is used. Consider how well btc-e is doing, I don\'t understand how you say it can\'t work. \n\n> Look, you may not like what I am saying, but it won\'t kill you to listen to another viewpoint. You sound like you have some very interesting opinions about the world and politics, which is great. But if you are as open minded to those ideals, why not be open minded to an alternate opinion.\n\nAgain, my arguement is that bitcoin should exist so that those with different economic ideals can coexist by having exchanges that operate in different ways. I want regulated exchanges to exist. But I hope we can continue to allow unregulated ones too, without attacking each others preferences. I pointed out your political leanings not as an attack, but to acknowledge our differences so that we can agree to disagree and not try to destroy the exchanges that cater to our different interests.

Any decent exchange should also hire a lobbyist or three for each major country or union of countries they want to legally act in, both to participate with the bitcoin foundation's efforts to bring btc into the regulatory light of day and to generally work with governments. A crappy lobbyist should cost a minimum of sixty grand a year. Let's say, conservatively, the exchange wants ONE lobbyist for the USA, ONE for the EU,  and maybe one for Japan. Assume those lobbyists will work with other lobbyists from other exchanges and the bitcoin foundation to get other shit done.\n\nSo, assuming you have already coded your shit and have everything mostly working and just need to work through every day operations, need to do a bit of lobbying, and need to do legal work occasionally, that adds up to 1.75 million a year JUST TO PAY SALARIES. No technology, no expenses like travel, no legal costs, no insurance, nothing like that. This is for an exchange that fluidly hits the ground running somehow.

Big software projects and big construction projects sort of cancel each other out in terms of economic infrastructure and bureaucracy; and to a large degree, a 10 mile highway is about 1/10th as much effort and capital intensive as a 100 mile highway; and will actually generally scale a little bit better than linerearly in terms of time/capital required.
