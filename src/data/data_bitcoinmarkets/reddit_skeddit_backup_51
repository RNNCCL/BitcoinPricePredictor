Chinese buyers entering the market cause a significant change in the fundamentals - not only in terms of increased aggregate demand, but also the regulatory landscape. A few months ago, bitcoin was largely US-centric, and if the US gov't had targeted US bitcoin-based companies, it could have possibly killed bitcoin entirely.

The anti-attack system only has a limited ability to differentiate legitimate traffic from attack traffic.\n\nThe attacker is leveraging an army of compromised systems that dwarfs your own resources.  You just have to batten down the hatches, do what you can to let legitimate traffic through and wait for the storm to pass.\n\nOr give in to the demands (typically extortion).  Usually sites that pay off the attackers don't want to talk about it.\n\nWhen trying to contact a site that is under attack - be patient.  Don't click reload.  Just open the link and let it load.  This can sometimes take several minutes.  Anti-DDoS systems will ding you for reloading too often - you look like part of the problem.

If it fails, wait a respectable time (seemed like about an hour in the case of bitstamp) before trying again.\n\nOnce you get through, try to keep your session open - navigate to a new page every few minutes, so the anti-ddos layer doesn't forget you're on it's whitelist.\n": 2, "Well, I believe it can be forgiven to Gox that they weren't prepared for the load spike in April.

Scatter a bunch of small shots in a bunch of promising companies or industries and when some start to look more promising, you give them more money. \n\nAnd this is also why I don\'t think the VC firm has much faith in coin setter.

So you throw money at coinsetter to help them launch. \n\nThere's no more to the story than that. That is throwing money at them. Shotgun style. I think you overestimate the amount of DD that goes ini a 500k deal. If that goes belly up and nothing comes from coinsetter. No big deal it's like a .1% loss to the funds performance. But if bitcoin gains more respect ad coinsetter management proves that they can perform. You add a little more money. Invest more give more direction an it becomes a serious investment. \n\nUltimate payoff would be if bitcoin becomes institutional investment grade and coinsetter is the main exchange (I don't think it would be at that point, but that's why I won't invest in coinsetter). That tiny investment grows exponentially and adds 5% or 10% to AUM. \n\nThat's the VC game in a nutshell. Throw money around into promising companies an industries as investments perform back them more. One or two top notch investments will cover all the failed 500k feelers. \n\nObviosly they didn't just blindly invest. But that's all the DD they did.

I recommend a credit card after linking a bank account. If there are no bank funds, they just charge the card and presto! At least, I think that's how it works. They claim to be revving up their systems to support larger volume, so hopefully this won't happen again. That, plus the rising BTC prices, as well as their purchase limits of up to 50 (depending on your verification level), it should be pretty manageable to keep things like this from happening. The Bitcoin market is, of course, erratic, and therefor someone whose job is to exchange them has a very unpredictable work environment and problems like this are undoubtedly going to arise once in a while.\n\nAnywho, I don't think it'll have a huge effect on the market.

Last I heard, the waiting period for withdrawals could go longer than 3 or 4 months. The price being low on Bitstamp right now could stem from current problems with their banking code, as well as Coinbase being out of coins earlier today, thus cash is flowing into bitstamp at a much slower rate. Also, since there is huge gap in price between BTCChina vs. Bitstamp and BTC-e that would signal a) arbitrage is ineffective currently (due to whatever reason) or b) China is buying lots of BTC and dumping it on Bitstamp and BTC-e for foreign currency. \n\nIn general, brokerage prices follow a certain exchange.

Even if just a few whale-clans independently come up with this strategy, as long as they each then take it into full consideration, they\'d probably realize "Hey, other whales are going to do the same thing" and all make their play at once. They don\'t even have to explicitly gang up for the game theory to help them decide that the move is "Sell."\n\nCombine this with the fact that Bitcoin\'s price *did* jump the gun a bit ($1000 one day after $500? seriously?) and you have a recipe for a profitable final correction before **THE** impending surge.\n\nTL;DR: **We just saw the final attempt of the existing whales to temporarily suppress the growth of Bitcoin in order to collect artificially-cheap-coins. In the next day or so, as they realize that it will go no lower, they will all be jumping back on board and riding this thing out as the fallout from Monday/Tuesday\'s press hits Bitcoin in a big way.**\n\nDo not underestimate this coming surge.

I rode it from around $52-75 for about a week on Mtgox and quit thereafter because I didn't trust the volatility, and was skeptical of the unbridled enthusiasm in /r/Bitcoin which was my primary source of information on the protocol.  I've followed it closely ever since, mostly here.  I got back in a month ago at ~$150, because I thought I finally grasped the genius of Satoshi and the developers that have continued his work, and finally understood how important a technology it could be.

I also sensed an oncoming uptick based on what I was reading here, but not even the most avaricious corner of my brain could have inspired me to imagine it quadrupling in a month. \n\nThis weekend I became afraid of the volatility again.
