I only trade in BTC and Eth. I\'ve balanced my account this way for the following reasons:\n\n* Bitcoin is an established store of value that\'s extremely secure and proven to work.\n* BTC is stable; Dev\'s are not actively creating new features and core developers are not talking about the long road ahead\n* BTC is not a fundamentally complicated technology to understand\n* BTC follows my rule of focusing investments on tools that solve one problem well\n* BTC solves the problem it\'s trying to solve better than anything else in existence\n* Investment tools for BTC are more mature\n* The inflation rate of BTC is comparably very low (though The DAO has had a measuable impact on that)\n* I invested in BTC first and made rules for myself about when and how much I can move at time\n* The price of BTC is much more stable\n\n**Eth also looks like a good investment** and I\'m comfortable maintaining that investment for the following reasons:\n\n* I became aware of Ethereum (distinct from Eth) in January or February of 2014 and have invested time and money in it over the last two years\n* I  know that Eth is fundamentally unique from BTC and is solving a different problem\n* There is no better solution for the problem Ethereum solves than Ethereum\n* Most people don\'t know they have problems that Ethereum solves well\n* Ethereum is not a curency or a commodity; it\'s a tool\n* Eth fuels Ethereum, which I use, so I need the Eth to fuel the things I do with Ethereum\n* I put in a small amount at a good time and it has grown to make up a large percentage of my portfolio\n* **I do not believe that Eth has a significant footprint on BTC, and I do not believe it ever will**\n\nThat last point is important and I think it relates to a lot of the speculative statements we\'re seeing in this sub today. Consider the following:\n\n* You can buy Eth with USD at:\n* * Gemini\n* * Bitfinex\n* * Kraken\n* * Poloniex\n* * Cex.io\n* Most of the market is made up of leverages at Poloniex (~60%), Kraken (~25%) and Bitfinex (<10%)\n* BTC-e added Eth (April 27th) and has about a sixth the volume of Gemini (added May 9th).\n* OKC (rumored) trading with Eth could/will destabilize the balance at some point. (I\'m curious to see how long it will take them to report that they are responsible for 80% of the volume of trades in that market.)\n* You can only move $2,000 USD of value in and out of Poloniex in a day.\n* Overall, USD/Eth transactions make up about 5% of the total trade volume.\n\nI don\'t believe that the price of Eth has a large footprint on Bitcoin. If you only look at the market cap that might confuse you, though. The bottom line is that the bigest place to trade Eth isn\'t a very big place to trade btc. In USD, Eth is traded at several orders of magnitude higher volumes than BTC at Poloniex.\n\nI think someone could make a case that Eth has an impact on BTC if they can show that Kraken is becoming/has become the established market leader when there are sudden and dramatic changes in the USD/Eth price.': -3, "Oh man this js too easy.

He's doing that so that the community will once and for all debunk him as being Satoshi, and then he can go back to obscurity again.\n\n>If Craig hired a bunch of lawyers and henchmen to convince Gavin, I don't think it's unreasonable to assume he's also trying to astroturf forums to bring his reputation out of the dismal place it's in.\n\nOk, now who's the one bending over backwards?  You're implying that a guy would astroturf subreddits for what?  So that users would believe him?  He knows the only thing that would prove him being part of Satoshi is cryptographic proof, and even that isn't an absolute proof of persona, just proof that he possesses the keys.\n\nAnd honestly, that's kind of my biggest problem with all of this:  The fact that people leap to the conclusion that Craig Wright is a con man trying to fraud his way into Satoshi's identity, and that therefore means CW is a moron or an idiot who didn't know any better.  CW is clearly not a moron or an idiot.  Fraud? That's still up in the air for me, but he is clearly not a moron.  He'd have known from the start that the only thing that would prove to the community that he was Satoshi was if he cryptographically proved it.  Con men are not dumb.\n\nWe must keep our mind open to the idea that CW is manipulating everyone here from the very beginning to come to the conclusion that he is not Satoshi because he wants everyone to believe that.\n\n\n": 0, "it reads how it reads.\n\nif everyone thinks that CW was _complete_ bullshit and has nothing to do with satoshi _at all_  and Gavin, JVP, Ian Grigg, and Matonis, are just completely retarded...  i think they are just believing what they want to believe and not looking at what's in front of them... \n": 2, "I wouldn't be shocked if OP works for Bovada.

Sign a fuckin message.\n\nAgain, you're making this grand assumption that you know what Satoshi would do, as if you understand his motives and his actions concretely.  You don't, so don't assume that you do.  If Satoshi wanted to remain anonymous, but his identity was made known to the press and the world got themselves in a tizzy over the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, wouldn't a good way to get out of that be to make yourself the whipping boy of the community and get yourself run out of town by said community?  \n\n>You know what Satoshi wouldn't do?

This is exactly the kind of stuff I'm talking about with all the assumptions that people are making.  It's incredibly dangerous to make blind assumptions to explain something we have no insight into.  You 100% cannot prove to me that the proof to show Gavin was rigged by CW.

Remember that we, the community, are dealing with a grave lack of information/insight into this whole affair, and that we\'re only seeing bits and pieces from the various players.  There is likely so much more to the story that we are completely out of the loop on.\n\nLet\'s say CW is a total fraud from start to finish.  What does he stand to gain from putting himself out to the media like he did?  He clearly wouldn\'t be able to prove to the community that he was Satoshi, so he would have to know that his plan would ultimately fail.  Why go to the great lengths of rigging a meeting with Matonis and Gavin to falsely "prove" to them that you are Satoshi when you know the rest of the community will ask for the same proof and then proceed to validate it independently?  I don\'t know if you guys have met any real con artists in real life, but they tend to be pretty intelligent people capable of thinking through many scenarios to their logical conclusion.  They don\'t get themselves into situations where they know they absolutely cannot satisfy the requirements called for.  It simply doesn\'t make sense for CW the con artist to put himself into that position by his own volition.  It\'s not like he got forced into that by the community or media.  It was his choice to come forward in that manner and approach Gavin and Jon Matonis.  Logically, that choice would not make sense if CW was conning everyone.\n\nHowever, the situation makes a lot more sense if CW is actually Satoshi or a member of the group behind the alias Satoshi Nakamoto.  If that is the case, then why show the truth the gavin and jon matonis, and then provide the community with convoluted BS that they\'d see right through?  Maybe, just maybe, CW is conning us all into believing that he is not Satoshi by creating this huge affair to draw everyone in just to watch him get publicly destroyed and debunked.  It reminds me of a Machiavellian maxim that organized crime has used as a tool forever:  If you want to send a message, do it in full view of the public & community (i.e. kill the person in broad daylight in front of everyone).  It feels to me like CW is sending a message of his choosing with this entire affair.  Remember that he was first uncovered back in December 2015, but it wasn\'t until a couple weeks ago that he began his attempts at reaching out to Jon Matonis and Gavin for verification.  Is no one wondering what plans he has been putting in place over the past 5 months?  \n\nOn top of that, there\'s the fact that Gavin says that he felt CW was Satoshi before they even began the verification process.  That swings pretty heavy for me because Gavin is one of the few people who had a lot of access/contact with Satoshi over time.  Even with a person trying to keep their privacy in tact as much as Satoshi, over time the conversations become more friendly and working relationships are developed.  In my opinion, there\'s almost no way that Gavin didn\'t have early conversations with Satoshi that only he and Satoshi would be able to recall or discuss now.  Gavin must have had a specific question ready to ask that he knew only the real "Satoshi" would be able to answer.  Then on top of that, you\'ve got Joseph VaughnPerling saying that he met Craig Wright at a conference in 2005 wearing a nametag for Satoshi Nakamoto and he had already formed the ideas behind bitcoin by then (5 years prior to the arrival of the white paper).\n\n>"I met him at a conference in 2005, he wore the moniker. We discussed what became Bitcoin at great length. He knew all there was to know about Bitcoin in 2005, and he shared it with me. I did not learn his government-registered name until much later."\n\nWhy would these men stake their reputation on a lie?  Or, maybe they weren\'t lied to at all?\n\nAll of this starts to fall into place for me if CW is actually a member of the Satoshi collective, and he\'s trying to regain his privacy back by letting the community publicly eviscerate him.\n\nEdit: Clearly this needs a TL-DR because half the responses are not even addressing what I said in my post and assuming I said something entirely different.\n\nTL-DR - It\'s quite possible that Craig Wright is truly conning us all by NOT providing cryptographic proof to the community, but only to Gavin and Jon for a moment in time.  If he really is Satoshi or a member of the Satoshi Collective, and he was forced out into the open (as he said in an interview), then a masterful way to regain his privacy would be to publicly implode and lose all credit within the community by not providing the cryptographic proof we desire.  I am not saying that CW is Satoshi.  I\'m just saying that the community should not be so quick to dismiss the idea just because CW doesn\'t provide cryptographic proof.  \n': -10, 'Read this:\n\nhttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/satoshi-saga-continues-tulip-trust-trustee-expected-to-appear-by-september-says-joseph-vaughnperling-1462467803': 0, 'Price went down when the news broke.

We know how to beat that system. In fact, we know how to nuke it for profit. Bitcoin is volatile, inherently deflationary and has no lender of last resort. Cornering and squeezing would work well - they use mass in a finite trading space. Modern predatory algos like bandsaw (testing markets by raising and suddenly dropping prices), sharktooth (electronically front-running orders), and band-burst (creating self-perpetuating volatile equilibria in a leverage-sensitive trading space, e.g. an inherently deflationary one), would rapidly wreak havoc.

This places our movement in a positive breakout, right at the most significant resistance point since last fall.\n\nOver the past several months, since we broke out to $500 last year, Bitcoin has attempted to break through the $465-70 barrier no less than four times.  It failed on each attempt.\n\nBecause of the serious consolidation since the first of the year I am optimistic that we will finally succeed this time.\n\nWith the breakout there are changes in our target numbers:\n\nThe estimated success of this break out is tarted using the formation with count and amount of the last break out.  Using the column width we add five boxes on top of the break out.  That puts our price target at $485.\n\nUsing the last break out (12 boxes from bottom to top) we overall THAT column onto our existing column\xe2\x80\x94bottom to top.  That places this \xe2\x80\x98rally\xe2\x80\x99 at the $500-505 box.\n\nKeep in mind it PnF charts are not day trading charts, but rather swing trade charts.  These target prices are for the next two weeks to a month.  They have been very accurate on the way down.  The way up?  They have been good long term, but not as precise.  So keep that in mind.\n\nI am optimistic about this time.  I know it is dangerous to suggest \xe2\x80\x9cthis time is different\xe2\x80\x9d because more often than not\xe2\x80\xa6its not.\n\nBut the trend is up and we are moving away from that slope.  The more distance from the support line, the better in my mind.  So, this morning I would suggest my optimism is probably a 7.5 out of 10.  If we break through $470 my optimism will be about a 9.\n\nI wrote up some thoughts on other charts that are included below.  If you do not want to read about them, stop reading here.\n\nHappy Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day to all of the moms out there.  Even though they are sometimes a pain in the ass, they are your mothers.  At least call them and sound sincere.\n\n[Chart Pack for the weekend](http://imgur.com/a/TIaIN)\n\n**Other Charts**\n\n**VXX**\n\nThe VXX is about to form a double bottom under $16.00.  This would be the third time its approached an low in the $15.50 box since last August.   It ties the lowest point on the VXX chart since 2013.  \n\nBetting that the VIX is going to go up seems to be a pretty obvious bet.  Of course, if the market goes crazy the price could go way up.  The 52 week high is $31.48.  The 52 week low is $15.90.  We are kissing the lows right now, without much further to go down.\n\n**SLV**\n\nSLV had a triple top break out last week.  The price is now 3 boxes above the break out price.  If it reverses here, it would indicate a bull trap and the price would go even lower.  \n\nJust as we are seeing with the VXX we are near multi year lows.  I think we might see a little consolidation near this area.  However, if the VXX shoots up, it would mean a flight to quality which has recently meant gold.  If gold shoots up, silver follows.\n\nI am optimistic we will see $20 before we see $10.\n\n**Dow 30**\n\nThe Dow broke a descending triple bottom this is week.  That is an exceptionally bearish formation.  It means that the it is cascading down.  Now, it might not \xe2\x80\x9csound\xe2\x80\x9d like that on CNBC or Bloomberg, but the chart doesn\xe2\x80\x99t lie.  The range for a bad breakdown is 17,400.  Thats only 300 points away.  It has to his 17950 to break out positively,.\n\n\n**S&P 500**\n\nThe S&P is in a precarious spot.  It need only drop below 2030 to indicate a breakdown.  The trend line is way down at 1900.  There is not a ton of support between where we are, and the trend line.  Some support at 2000 and 1950.  Nice round numbers.\n\n**Gold**\n(GLD)\nThe Gold chart is looking quite bullish.  With the recent move into the $123 box, be broke the downward trend that has been resistance since 2013.  This could be very bullish.\n\nA move up to 124 would be a break out, after a long pole break out.  That is a very bullish indicator.\n\n**Summary**\n\nIt is not often that several asset classes on the precipice at the same time.\n\nThe S&P and Dow are on the brink of break downs.  The Nasdaq is very close to a reversal.\n\nThe VXX and Silver are near recent all time lows.  There is pressure for them to go up.\n\nGold has broken a several year negative trend and poised for its first big breakout in years.\n\nI remain bullish on the VIX (VXX) for the near term, as a \xe2\x80\x9cblack swan\xe2\x80\x9d trade.  When it goes up, it will pop up like a cork.  And by \xe2\x80\x9cblack swan\xe2\x80\x9d means that I have some out of the money options that are a month out.  I periodically roll those options out another week.  It is really chump change to gain if and when the VIX goes back up.\n\nI am bullish long term on Silver.  My silver options have been pretty successful since the end of February.  My silver options are slightly out of the money and no closer than six months.  If it pulls back for a few weeks, I will survive without massive losses.\n\nI am less optimistic, but still positive on BTC.  It HAS to make a break at the $465-70 range to finally break through that 3,000 CYN resistance.  If it can do that, it is pretty clear sailing to $500.\n\nThe thing that everyone should be considering is that if the Dow and S&P fall quickly there will be margin calls galore.  Traders will have to unwind and find cash quickly.  In the past that has hurt bitcoin in the near term.  Bitcoin is not quite a \xe2\x80\x9cflight to safety\xe2\x80\x9d at this time.  It might change.\n\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cdoom porn\xe2\x80\x9d folks are expecting silver and gold to explode.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think \xe2\x80\x9cexplode\xe2\x80\x9d is the right term.  But I think we are going to see some downward pressure on the markets.  \n\nThe yield on the 10 year Treasury is 4 bp from triggering a negative break down.  That it not a stretch either.  Obviously the \xe2\x80\x9cprice\xe2\x80\x9d on the $UST is rising.  And its been rising since April 2004.  Nothing goes up forever.  A 10 year yield of 1.79% is not exactly predicting robust growth.\n\n\n\n\n\nResources\n\nSource:  Bitcoinaverage.com chart for dollar, index weighted price based on when I look at chart\n\n*[Dorsey-Wright, the best source of PnF Information](http://dorseywright.com/education/point-and-figure-glossary)*\n\n*[Investor Intelligence explanation of PnF Charts](http://www.investorsintelligence.com/x/using_point_and_figure_charts.html)\n\n*[Market Edge Explanation of  PnF Charts](http://www.marketedge.com/MarketEdge/DRME/drPFChart.aspx)\n\n*[Stockcharts](http://support.stockcharts.com/forums/30077/entries/21293)\n\n': 36, 'Just noticed ibankbtc edited their post and said they went long.

Bitcoin is a part of my portfolio.\n\nI am noticing Bitcoin is acting more and more like a natural commodity when compared to the recent action going on in the world financial markets.  Nations are currently in a currency war most notably between China, Japan, and Europe.. each with its own intricacies.  However the US economy is currently the strongest of them all but still making excuses as why not to raise our interest rate (Real reason: because we will crush all other economies, including our own.. though we would weather the storm a lot better than everyone else).  A large part is due to the political turmoil as Obama ends his 8-year legacy.  Yellen and friends are under direction of everyone in office to prop the economy up.  This means not raising interest rates which inadvertently puts us front and center in the global currency war.  \n\nMeanwhile gold, oil, and real estate continue to be safe havens for value.  To bring everything full circle, in just this past week alone the USD has devalued greatly and has caused all sorts of pain across the US economy while simultaneously easing the burden on foreign countries (see USD/YEN forex over the past 14 day period).  What we are seeing in bitcoin is the reflection of all this economic drama in the form of BTC going up in value.  Now realize that BTC at $460/per is the same value as BTC was at $440 last week.  The interesting overlap comes when you compare BTC over the last 14 day period to Oil (@CL.1), Gold Industrials ($GDX), USD futures (@DX), and the S&P 500 ($SPY) and you see a similar trend.  Commodities go up to as a safe haven from volatility.  Bitcoin is following right along.*\n\nWhat does this mean for the future of bitcoin?  The Wright/Nakamoto story ended with a fizzle instead of a bang.  The markets shrugged it off and continued to keep pace with other commodities.  Bitcoin is entering a mature stage with the upcoming halvening event.  The current slow bull trend is bitcoin being realized as a a reputable, albeit expensive, store of value.  Until the global market situation resolves and a clear leader is established, expect Bitcoin to gain value over the next 2-3 years.

We are not seeing the unemployment numbers change suggesting this is not the case.  However companies are *re-classifying* employees as part time which could force employees to quit without taking unemployment or force employees to take on more than one job.  With such a huge hidden labor market after changes to unemployment reporting, this could very well be 'creating' new candidates to cycle the job pool.

Why go to the great lengths of rigging a meeting with Matonis and Gavin to falsely "prove" to them that you are Satoshi when you know the rest of the community will ask for the same proof and then proceed to validate it independently?  I don\'t know if you guys have met any real con artists in real life, but they tend to be pretty intelligent people capable of thinking through many scenarios to their logical conclusion.  They don\'t get themselves into situations where they know they absolutely cannot satisfy the requirements called for.  It simply doesn\'t make sense for CW the con artist to put himself into that position by his own volition.  It\'s not like he got forced into that by the community or media.  It was his choice to come forward in that manner and approach Gavin and Jon Matonis.  Logically, that choice would not make sense if CW was conning everyone.\n\nHowever, the situation makes a lot more sense if CW is actually Satoshi or a member of the group behind the alias Satoshi Nakamoto.  If that is the case, then why show the truth the gavin and jon matonis, and then provide the community with convoluted BS that they\'d see right through?  Maybe, just maybe, CW is conning us all into believing that he is not Satoshi by creating this huge affair to draw everyone in just to watch him get publicly destroyed and debunked.  It reminds me of a Machiavellian maxim that organized crime has used as a tool forever:  If you want to send a message, do it in full view of the public & community (i.e. kill the person in broad daylight in front of everyone).  It feels to me like CW is sending a message of his choosing with this entire affair.  Remember that he was first uncovered back in December 2015, but it wasn\'t until a couple weeks ago that he began his attempts at reaching out to Jon Matonis and Gavin for verification.  Is no one wondering what plans he has been putting in place over the past 5 months?  \n\nOn top of that, there\'s the fact that Gavin says that he felt CW was Satoshi before they even began the verification process.  That swings pretty heavy for me because Gavin is one of the few people who had a lot of access/contact with Satoshi over time.  Even with a person trying to keep their privacy in tact as much as Satoshi, over time the conversations become more friendly and working relationships are developed.  In my opinion, there\'s almost no way that Gavin didn\'t have early conversations with Satoshi that only he and Satoshi would be able to recall or discuss now.  Gavin must have had a specific question ready to ask that he knew only the real "Satoshi" would be able to answer.  Then on top of that, you\'ve got Joseph VaughnPerling saying that he met Craig Wright at a conference in 2005 wearing a nametag for Satoshi Nakamoto and he had already formed the ideas behind bitcoin by then (5 years prior to the arrival of the white paper).\n\n>"I met him at a conference in 2005, he wore the moniker. We discussed what became Bitcoin at great length. He knew all there was to know about Bitcoin in 2005, and he shared it with me. I did not learn his government-registered name until much later."\n\nWhy would these men stake their reputation on a lie?  Or, maybe they weren\'t lied to at all?\n\nAll of this starts to fall into place for me if CW is actually a member of the Satoshi collective, and he\'s trying to regain his privacy back by letting the community publicly eviscerate him.

I was asked to sign an NDA in order to discuss the project itself, something I am reluctant to do, in general. Once I received the NDA however, it became obvious that the project was related to verifying the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto. I immediately declined the offer, declined to participate and declined to sign the NDA.\n\n>I\'m sure many people will think I was wrong to decline the "opportunity" to verify SN\'s identity. From my perspective, the request for me to verify his/her/their identity is in itself an appeal to authority. It is replacing public cryptographic proof with endorsement by a third party. If SN wants to "prove" their identity, they don\'t need an "authority" to do so. They can do it in a public, open manner. To ask people in the space who have a reputation to stake that reputation and vouch for SN\'s identity raises many red flags in my mind.\nI don\'t know if Craig Wright is SN. I don\'t care and I don\'t want to know.\n\n>As I have expressed many times in the past, I think the identity of Satoshi Nakamoto does not matter. More importantly I think it serves to distract from the fact that bitcoin is not controlled by anyone and is not a system of Appeal-to-Authority. Identifying the creator only serves to feed the appeal-to-authority crowd, as if SN is some kind of infallible prophet, or has any say over bitcoin\'s future.\nIdentity and authority are distractions from a system of mathematical proof that does not require trust. This is not a telenovela. Bitcoin is a neutral framework of trust that can bring financial empowerment to billions of people. It works because it doesn\'t depend on any authority.

We don't know which coins belong to satoshi, spending a few of them is quite possible. If questioned by the tax agency, he could simply answer he was an early miner.

You just want to as quickly and simply as possible automatically convert batches of BTC that you have in your wallet to USD.\n\nIMHO the easiest and simplest way to do that is to use a feature like a coinapult lock or a coinbase instant USD wallet or UPHOLD.  They all provide essentially the same service: that is, a bitcoin address or series of addresses such that when you send to them it automatically exchanges to USD at the current exchange rate.\n\nHere's what you do: Make one of these accounts and get verified.   Get the address for the USD wallet on coinbase (or coinapult lock address or USD card on uphold).   Code your wallet backend for your ecommerce site to make regular (as often as you want) deposits to this address and it will be autoconverted.  Then, once a month, make a withdraw from those sites using your bank information.\n\nIt's stupid easy to set up and requires no programming at all...you just code your current bitcoin invoicing system to point at your USD address.   \n\nThis works for you and it's very very simple.

We do not support withdrawals via western union / moneygram or check in mail. \n\nWe are actually currently in the process of developing an Auto-sell and Auto-withdraw feature that would enable you to automatically sell any bitcoin that is sent to one of your wallets and then automatically withdraw the USD to your bank upon reaching a threshold chosen by you.

[Contango and backwardation are very confusing](upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/Contangobackwardation.png). What is more important is producer (miner) economics. \n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions I see on this sub surrounds efficient markets and pricing in known events. The expected value of an event (future spot price) changes as P(event) becomes higher and higher - there is a chance every day that bitcoin implodes, we are struck by an asteroid, etc. P(event) approaches (event) as time to event approaches zero. This should not be a significant factor because P(event) should essentially equal 100%, less a 6 Sigma occurrence. \n\nSo we know that the expected future spot price should be stable to slightly increasing. \n\nHowever, this isn't just about pricing in an event - it's about manufacturing costs. Stop thinking about bitcoin, and think about making widgets to simplify. We have producers making screws (washers, nuts, bolts, whatever). MR=MC (plus margin perhaps). So while the event is known and priced in every second, miner economics change discretely and significantly at a single moment in time. Their marginal revenue is cut in half at the halving, so their marginal costs must fall similarly to continue operating. Assuming fixed prices, their margins fall, or they simply stop manufacturing widgets. \n\nHowever, prices are not fixed. The alternative to lowering costs is raising prices to make MR=MC again. This manufacturer (miner) adjustment in operations will not occur until the event happens. In reality, some miners will drop out, and some will raise prices, and others on 16nm chips probably just don't care and continue making (smaller) margins. Exactly where the aggregate market cost of marginal production lands is where we will see prices go.

We tend to think the former, but will certainly not rule out the latter given it is perfectly reasonable from a risk/reward perspective right now. Whatever the case, the bears are having a helluva time pushing prices below the short and medium term trendlines.\n\nHaving said that, we have noticed an increase in bearish sentiment lately, especially from the exchange trollboxes and TradingView, which in conjunction with price action tells us that the bears are simply unable to generate enough fear to drive us down through support (at least for the time being).

This could potentially drive margin calls to the downside. \n\nGenerally speaking, we view the last few weeks of bitcoin trading as bullish despite a legitimate breakout to the upside.

Security is a spectrum, with stronger security often being far less convenient to use.

The margin funding allows users to provide margin funding to traders so that they can trade on leverage. In return, the traders pay the margin funding providers a set percentage of the amount provided. Currently the rate for USD is ~0.045% per day. \n\nIf you want to provide funding you simply transfer funds to the deposit wallet. Then you decide how long you want to provide the funding for and at what rate, after placing an offer you wait for someone to take it, or you could fill instantly by matching the best margin funding bit. Additionally, we offer autorenew, this automatically renews your funding offers at a rate of your choice, or you can set it at FRR (basically an average that updates once an hour). \n\nThe fees for margin funding providers is 15% of the interest paid. \n\nFor those that want to trade on margin, you have two options, reserving the funding yourself or have the system take it out for you. So if you go to the trading tab and open a position (simply margin buy/sell the amount you want) the system will automatically take out the required margin funding for you at the current best price. The other option is to go to the margin funding page and finding an offer that suits your needs, then you can reserve it. Once you make a margin trade that margin funding will automatically be used to back your position. As a trader the fees you pay will be the trading fee which are outlined on our [fees page](https://www.bitfinex.com/pages/fees) plus the cost of the margin funding. \n\nFor more information refer to our [FAQ](https://www.bitfinex.com/support) and [How It Works](https://www.bitfinex.com/pages/howitworks) pages.\n\n\nIf you have any other questions don't hesitate to let me know.

In the best case it follows the trend of previous bubbles and more than doubles (+100% return).\n\nScenario B: This is the negative scenario. The worst outcome is that bitcoin tanks (it probably will trickle downards). If this occurs, it can tank to 400, 300, hell maybe 200--but doubt it.

I am saying this:\n\nIf mining companies are selling 50% (an assumption for this example) of their results to cover expenses, then at the halving they will have to sell 100% of their results to cover the same expenses.\n\nFor example, if they are mining 3,600 per day now at $X, they must sell enough coins to cover $X.  After the Halving, they will still spend $X to generate 1,800 coins.  They must still sell enough coins to cover their expenses.\n\nAssuming the miners are not philanthropists (a joke) they need to make a profit.  \n\nSo, the important questions are what is $X?  And what is Profit - $X.  And, as a miner, what percentage of your mined coins have you been saving (banking?)\n\nMy point is that bitcoins all have the same value.  If I am a miner and I have not been selling ALL of my coins every day, month, year I have been banking them as a store of value--either assuming they will go up in value, or you will spend them in some other way.  \n\nThose stored coins have not been included in Sales Volume.\n\nThe prevailing opinion seems to be that if the miners can only inject 1/2 of their coins into the market to cover their expenses and profits then the sales supply will trend downward putting more upward pressure on price.\n\nMy argument is that if the margin of the miners is more than 50% they will remain profitable by putting the same number of coins into the marketplace.  Their horde will not grow.  Therefore the supply of coins going INTO the available supply will not change.\n\nThe result of that would be a short term panic and a significant drop during the heart of the summer.\n\nIf I were a miner, I would be reducing my horde by quite a bit now--and picking up the easy fruit after it drops.  That would cause a swing back up.  And then it should settle down after a short time.\n\nIn the end, equilibrium would eventually bring the price upward.\n\nThe ONLY unknown is how many coins are the miners injecting into the supply NOW.  \n\nOf course there are income, taxes, and individual tolerance for risk on everyone\'s part.\n\n\n\nDoes that make sense?\n\nI am not advocating a trade into this--one way or the other.

Yes the reason I split funds between severals assets is to limit the volatility and big losses. When one is falling there is chance the other is doing well. But to be really effective, the selected assets should have low correlation together and unfortunatly the algo isn't perfect because it measures the correlation between one asset and all the others crypto in the list of candidates. Then less corelated asset has a higher rank. From what I have seen in papers this method is quite efficient to lower risk in a portfolio. It is related to diversification as well.\n\nI added a -0.2% to the daily return of the portfolio to see what happens after trading fees are applied. Probably it is not the right method to calculate impact of trading fees but it should gives an idea.

R has lot's of packages and features and Stackoverflow has a great R community.

It's a for loop with length = nb_days * nb_cryptos whatever theirs volume. Tooks me several months to build the script as it is today but still there are some minor bugs.

First, the script didn't checked historical volume of every single crypto and secondly I used data from Cryptsy at that time, with liquidity much lower.\n\nTo reply your question I didn't backtest 2015 with the final version of the algo but this is a good point and it is something I will do. 2015 was bullish for Bitcoin and I think most of the altcoins where getting bad. I'll update this thread with the result but not the site as I will not be able to backtest 2015 with the 00:05am close price (it gives slightly higher return than 00:00am). \n\nSo yes, the algo is optimized and still in validation. Thing is it all depends of the market conditions and it may has a bull market bias with the YTD backtest (at least for altcoins). The good thing is that altcoins bear market of the last 4 weeks hasn't impacted the portfolio that much.\n\nHowever, no parameters has dramatic impact on the result. Here are basically parameters I use : \n\n- time of the candle\n- opening or closing price\n- volume threshold\n- timeframes for momentum measurement\n- weighting factors for momentum, volatilty and correlation\n- weighting factor for strenght of the crypto in the portfolio\n- rebalancing frequency\n\nI'm not trading with lives funds at the moment but this is something I will consider after writing a script to open and close trades.

For this reason i try to only report live trade results. It doesn't cost much to run an algorithm with a few milibitcoins and if you let it run long enough it gives much more information than a backtest. I have a few different accounts on the same exchange with slightly different bot settings, and it's quite useful to see how they differ even if my algo has only one parameter that really matters.\n\nAnyway, is there any specific reason that you split your funds between multiple coins? I haven't tried portfolio allocation before. I always had the impression that if you think asset A will have higher returns than asset B, it makes sense to go all-in on assert A rather than split funds between the two.

This has, in the past, been a precursor of subsequent big moves, e.g. in the beginning of 2013.\n\n- The term premium as measured in spot minus quarterly on okcoin, or quarterly minus the weekly or biweekly future, is very low.

': 4, 'Hi /u/greek_warrior, I\'m the Director of Community & Product Development at Bitfinex, i\'m more than happy to help you out. \n\n1) You don\'t need to set your leverage, how much leverage youre using is simply your position size divided by how much money you have.  Lets say you have $100 in your account, you can use up to 3.3x leverage on Bitfinex. But if you only open a position worth $200 you\'d only be using 2x leverage, $250:2.5x, $275:2.75x etc. So you can choose to use whatever leverage you want.\n\n2) The box that you\'re looking at there basically gives you a snapshot of the margin funding market. When you toggle "Display variable rates" on/off, what you\'re doing is telling the system whether or not to include offers that use variable rates (FRR). The maximum margin rate tells the system the extent of the range you would like to see, i.e., you want to see the sum of all offers below 0.75%/day, or all offers below 0.5% day. \n3) As I said above, the % you choose here effectively gives a range to the snapshot you\'re seeing of the margin funding market. (0-0.75%, or 0-0.5%)\n\n4) You will more than likely be paying higher fees for higher leverage as that means you have to reserve more in funding. If you have $100 and take out $100 in margin funding you\'re only paying fees on that $100 in margin funding, if you take out $200, then you\'d be paying fees on the $200 instead of $100. But it\'s not like we charge you different trading fees or interest rates depending on how much leverage you use, it just increases the amount of money under your control that you need to pay fees for. \n\nIf you have any other questions please let me know and I\'ll try to get to you right away.

Imagine if the lightbulb was on for mere seconds (perhaps it is a lightbulb in a walk-in-wardrobe into which I\xe2\x80\x99ve walked only to retrieve a specific item of clothing). The cost of the electricity consumed would be only a fraction of a penny.\n\nThis requirement disqualifies known fiat currencies as eligible candidates. Why? Because all fiat currencies are designed for an analogue world \xe2\x80\x93 for humans. The denominations are per hundred. There are one-hundred cents in a Euro or a Dollar; one hundred pennies in a Pound. These denominations are too large to facilitate a micropayment. (Although some would argue that these payments can be \xe2\x80\x9crolled up\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 aggregated to sufficient size before being executed.)\nSecondly, the cost per transaction would need to be minute \xe2\x80\x93 almost free \xe2\x80\x93 and certainly a lot less than whatever amount is in question. Using the current rails \xe2\x80\x93 say the scheme rails or ACH \xe2\x80\x93 would be prohibitive. The cost of the transaction would significantly outweigh the values in question.\n\nA much more eligible candidate currency would be a cryptocurrency \xe2\x80\x93 like Bitcoin or Ethereum\xe2\x80\x99s Ether. Why? Firstly, because the denominations go down to the tiniest amount. The smallest denomination of Bitcoin, for example, is the so-called Satoshi (named after its mysterious alleged founder) which is one-hundred-millionth (that\xe2\x80\x99s 0.000000001) of a Bitcoin. Secondly, because the cost of the transaction CAN become almost negligible, using smart contracts that enable an escrow without a trusted third party.\n\nFor this reason \xe2\x80\x93 and also because we here find two of our Collab themes (Smart Cities/IoT + Blockchain) collide and interlink \xe2\x80\x93 Visa Europe Collab is pleased to announce a Proof-of-Concept we are running with Berlin based start-up SatoshiPay, to demonstrate micropayments in a M2M context.

That hashing power could then again become less profitable at the halving.\n\n> Since production costs are a large part of a mining operation, i believe a drop in difficulty is unlikely.\n\nObviously not all mining operations are hugely profitable, in fact it is very competitive, and cutting their bitcoin income by half could conceivably mean if they continue to mine they take losses, which they could try to hold out for a price rise but like you were pondering earlier: "What are those miners going to do if the price doesn\'t rise? Hold them as they go bankrupt?" Very likely they would just stop mining, and a drop in hashing power will occur, difficulty takes 2 weeks to update to the new hashing power.\n\nIf I were a miner I would have been buying and holding altcoins, and then just before the cut buy back bitcoins. This strategy means a rise due to speculation is suppressed and you don\'t attract competition, meaning you get more bitcoins.\n\nBut if I were a gambling man I would bet in favor of "market failure" on this.\n': 1, "My predictions for halving, I think BTC will go up.\n\nBitfury is the largest bitcoin miner right now.\n\nThey're currently profitable at ~260/coin, but they've also spent over $40 million on facilities and R&D. They're fully invested in.\n\nThey're selling their 16 nm 12 petahash containerized units for roughly $2 mil each.\n\nIf they've already been selling those containers, it should have an impact upon:\n\n* The mining hash rate. \n* The difficulty.\n\nSo upon halving of the reward, I believe they will not remain profitable at current rates and will have to sell those coins for more. I don't think they're going to close up shop, they're too far in to quit. Just their new facility they're building in Trail BC is costing them $20 million.\n\nSo my prediction is that the price of BTC will go up after halving.\n": 1, "Markets take the stairs up and the elevator down.\n\nPsychologically people are slow to buy in when they see the price rising because greed is not very strong. When the price is falling people become fearful quickly and sell, remembering all the other drops.\n\nInterestingly the 2013/14 and 2011 times in bitcoin were the opposite. People where overwhelmed by greed and the price shot up like a rocket, they were not very fearful so didn't sell fast and the price bleed slowly for months.": 5, 'The time it takes to move the coins, volatility and above all the time it takes to get fiat back.

The hardest part, aside from counterparty risk, is getting Fiat around to balance accounts.\n\nTo arb effectively, you need both bitcoin and fiat on every exchange you arbitrage - then you can immediately buy in one place and sell in another, eliminating the risk involved with price movements while transferring bitcoins and awaiting confirmations. Each time you arbitrage, afterwards you have to adjust your setup by balancing accounts. Moving the Fiat around, in sufficiently large amounts is particularly difficult.\n\nEasier to do it with small amounts, but then it's a lot of work for hardly any pay.": 2, 'IMO, The upward retrace channel is broken, so the price is going down again, in a big "dump" manner.

The rest of the market will expect the price to rise as a result of the former, and thus will apply an opposite effect (buy now, sell after the halving) causing the price to rise now and drop after the halving.

They would be stupid to do so, if the price is going to rise in the future as you say.\n\nIt's true that the market in general could be speculating the rise of bitcoin and holding coins, artificially easing itself into a price that matches the expected price after the 'halvening'. But if that were true, anyone who is barely profiting on mining currently would have been accidentally added as dead weight because the price has risen too soon, and those people will find after the mining cut that it is unprofitable and need to stop mining. The loss of hashing power will have a delayed impact on difficulty and will also cause bitcoin confirmation times to increase until the difficulty adjusts, and the transaction throughput will be harmed and if past performance (February/March) represents the future, you will see bitcoin prices crash and become bear and the price of alcoins become bullish.\n\nAssuming of course the market prices in the rise.\n": 1, "> So upon halving of the reward, I believe they will not remain profitable at current rates and will have to sell those coins for more.

I definitely read them and weigh them in my mind.\n\nThere is one primary criterion that I\'m waiting on before I go margin long: I want to see China at least 30-40 CNY ahead of the USD price. When I say China, I mean real China, not U.S. traders on Chinese exchanges. If the CNY price exceeds the USD price during the daytime in China, for a couple of days, then I\'ll take that as a signal that the price *may* be allowed to move up.\n\nMaybe I\'m right, maybe I\'m wrong. I know that sometimes things which would otherwise be obvious slip through the cracks when you\'re not looking in that direction. I\'ve been watching the price for the last several weeks, and we generally see a drift upwards beginning in the U.S. daytime, with a slow increase until around Chinese mid-morning. About that time, the price begins to gradually decline, and usually when I wake up the next morning, we\'re $2-$4 lower than when I went to bed.\n\nCombine that with the initial "fake out" attempt to break the triangle downward, which began on Chinese exchanges in a Chinese time zone, the effort to pump LTC, which is a Chinese favorite, and the timing of our upward and downward drifts, and I\'m not sure that China is willing to allow too much bullishness.\n\ntl;dr Until China gets out ahead of the U.S., I\'m afraid they are going to fight the bull market as hard as possible.

I think that would happen if the miners really dropped the ball in preparing for the halving.  ***This implies that they\'re NOT getting ready to react for the event, resulting in a mismanagement that leads to their*** (the mining operations\') ***shutdown.***\n\nSee how these two are a bit contradictory?
