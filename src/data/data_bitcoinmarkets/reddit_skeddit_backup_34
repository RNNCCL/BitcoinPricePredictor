In the case of bitcoin, it would be big money (we\'re talking hundreds of millions) coming in, and just starting to buy a lot over a period of time, effectively "drawing" the charts in such a way that it creates the illusion of strong support for the asset,  literally buying/selling in such a way to manifest TA patterns that are designed to be misleading.  It might also involve a lot of marketing bullshit, social media pumping, and other "news" that is actually aimed at creating a bubble in the best case scenario.   \n\nSo a bubble can in fact be manifested by a pump and dump scheme but doesn\'t have to be.  But the goal of a pump and dump scheme is to leverage an extremely disproportionate amount of capital to create crazy price jumps, hoping to lure in buyers closer to the top looking to get rich quick.  The scheme will continue basically until the sum of bids nearer to the top are greater than the sum of ask points the pumper bought in at.  If everyone thinks the asset is crap and won\'t buy it for anywhere but the "fair market value", a pump and dump scheme would end in a huge loss for the schemer, so that\'s why they are usually coupled with fraudulent reports and other bullshit to encourage buyers.\n\nAs for a bubble, that would not be such a scheme but rather it would be just overly bullish market participants, a frenzy that actually can\'t be sustained for an extended period of time, and eventually pops due to the overvaluation of the asset.  So it\'s a little bit like comparing apples to oranges in that one describes intention of a very small number of market participants with huge leverage, and the other describes the market behavior of an overvalued asset.\n\n**tldr;**  if there is another "bubble" it would start based on legit demand;  we would expect the price to rally far too high but definitely not return to $450, whereas a pump and dump might end up with the same price or lower.': 2, "Because that's when we will reach the breakout point.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/v/Ca89v0rO/\n\nAnd because of lurker5454's birthday.": 0, 'Same.

My suggestion is to build out a robust platform and be ready to be taken out by a company with a real balance sheet.": 1, "Great question.  Volume and liquidity are of course going to be key in providing actual value to the participants in the market.  It is a chicken and egg problem, but there are bad ways to go about it and better ways, albeit difficult.  In Atlas's case (and a few others I can think of) the platform looks very much like the options market grid for a mature market, say puts & calls on IBM stock.  The problem with providing a plethora of strikes (both strike prices and expiration dates) is that you are dividing up your potential market. Even worse is that the monthly expirations, though superficially familiar to traditional options traders, don't actually provide much value for for Bitcoin holders right now.  Most of the exchange risk right now is relatively short term (60 minutes to 24 hours) and the price volatility on a month or longer scale is essentially unquantifiable.  I feel that there will be more of a market for shorter duration contracts and if we offer a single (or at most two) strikes at that optimal duration we can focus on liquidity first and expansiveness second.  \n\nI feel that Bitcoin ATM operators or payment processors are a great candidate for using our service.  If they are actually covering themselves against double spending by waiting for transactions to confirm they have ~60 minutes of exchange risk to bake into that transaction, let alone dealing with portfolio balancing given the relative thinness of exchange markets.  One payment processor I talked to had a sudden influx of transactions that left them with a six-figure $USD position long Bitcoin that they needed to sell off to balance their cash books.  Margins on those services are not large enough to always absorb price movements from selling off large positions, let alone macro market price movements that go against their position.  \n\nSo we are very actively seeking out payment processors, ATM operators, mining pools, and larger traders in non-US/EU markets that would be interested in using our service on a reduced fee schedule to provide liquidity.  ": 6, 'the major problem i found w/ guys like atlas (or others attempts in the btc option space) was there was absolutly not vol or liquidity going through them. Making Markets was in general a waste of time. What are you doing to attract Market Makers to steam quotes ?\n': 3, 'Atlas launched with no liquidity, but after a couple weeks a market maker bot came online and it continues to provide modest liqudity. The order book has 1 btc worth of bids/ask offers on every strike/duration Atlas has at ~95% of the time now. The spreads are very high but this does put Atlas in the lead as far as providing liquidity for bitcoin options for the time being. I hope bitfuture is able to provide superior liquidity. ': 3, "A good perspective.  We're in talks with regulators about the kind of balance sheet we'd need to satisfy their thresholds for consumer protection.  It's a very interesting conversation to say the least, and I'm  building out the accounting backend in parallel to accommodate whatever sorts of checks and balances will be required to conform to their requirements.  ": 3, "I'd love to see a bitcoin options market with strong liquidity and a full range of strikes/duration. To that end, I wish you luck on launching your platform! I hope you'll learn from other operations that have tried to enter the same space, namely Atlas, Derivabit, Fairlay, and Predictious. \n\nEveryone so far has launched with the presumption that if they build it, liquidity will come, and everyone has been proven wrong. It seems to me, that the onus is on you to get the liquidity party started from day one. ": 3, "Thanks for your comment - you're spot on about the counterparty risk issue.  Our method of having calls fully covered and puts covered up to a 50% drop in price is a sort of happy medium.  If we see some more significant downward shift in price, or even see a significant demand from our users, we may increase the coverage required from the writer of a put option - but for now coverage on a 50% drop on 24 hour contracts seems sufficient.   \n\nRegulation will be interesting and will vary depending on the treatment or classification of bitcoin (i.e., security, independent currency of some sort, commodity).  It's difficult because under current legal definitions, bitcoin is none of those things.  I think regulators are more looking for a way to easily plug bitcoin into the existing regulatory structure, but are trying to fully vet the ways bitcoin could be used to be sure the current regulations are robust enough to cover potentially dangerous fringe uses/cases.  \n\nBut I think you will see market operators (specifically derivatives market operators, we know exchanges have their regulatory hoops to jump through already) needing licenses in some form or another, and I suspect those licenses will require operators to build in some counterparty risk mitigation measuring in some form or another.  \n\nTruth be told there's not an easy answer.  There's always risk (even in traditional financial instruments - think about how many people don't pay their credit card bills or mortgages), it's just going to be a question of what level of risk is acceptable in the cryptocurrency space.  \n\nThe regulators are asking the right questions, and we're doing our best to answer.  \n\nThanks again, and feel free to reach out with any additional questions or comments!": 1, "What advantages do you, or will you, offer over Atlas's options markets?": 2, "I think I touched on it when replying to u/nomadismydj, but I can just say that we are trying to build an options platform that is useful to Bitcoin businesses and significant holders of Bitcoin, not just making a literal copy of the CBOT options market for a given stock or index.  The existing mature options markets have their form and conventions for certain structural reasons; we hope to innovate something that is truly effective in providing value to the Bitcoin community, both in taming large scale price fluctuations and effectively locking in exchange rates.\n\nI feel that building the market from the beginning as an all-Bitcoin platform helps insulate it from the difficulties that have been encountered with previous attempts that interface with the banking system.  We hope to have solid banking partners in the future once we are properly licensed in the US and EU, but until then we aren't going to be interrupted in providing our service because a banking partner decides to backtrack on their services. We are also available to a wider set of customers than those who can easily use an ACH or SEPA transfer for funding or withdrawing from their account.  \n\nMainly I think we will have an advantage as a derivatives-first company; we aren't trying to run an exchange or any other sort of financial service.  Our mission is to create a thriving Bitcoin options market and that alone.  \n\nThanks for asking!": 3, 'Nice focus!

Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes an ever further rise in the stock's price, which in turn may trigger additional margin calls and short covering.\n\n>Short squeezes are more likely to occur in stocks with small [market capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_capitalization) and small [floats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Float_(finance\\)), although can involve large stocks and billions of dollars, as happened in October 2008 when a short squeeze temporarily drove the shares of [Volkswagen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen) on the [Xetra DAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xetra_DAX) from [\xe2\x82\xac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro)210.85 to over \xe2\x82\xac1000 in less than two days, briefly making it the most valuable company in the world.  \n\n>\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Squeezed ^in ^the ^middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squeezed_in_the_middle) ^| [^Short ^interest ^ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_interest_ratio) ^| [^Long ^squeeze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_squeeze) ^| [^Short ^\\(finance)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_\\(finance\\)) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+chart42) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+chart42)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)": 4, "I'm not sure how having X programmers means something is undervalued.": 6, "Looking like someone is thinking it's time for a squeeze!\n\n": 3, 'Translate with google or bing': 3, "IDK why, but Chrome on my android tablet has been flagging TV as malicious.

This is interesting information because it can be used to compare the slope under the most recent bubble with other slopes in history. From this comparison, you can see that the December bubble is very similar to previous bubbles. It is easy to get discouraged when the price goes from $1200 to $400 in four months. It is nice to be able to see mathematical proof that this behavior is completely typical for Bitcoin, and indeed is what happens right before a new bubble begins.\n\nDoes that mean that a new bubble will begin? No. But it helps you realize that the unpleasant downtrend over the last few months is not evidence against a new bubble, but rather is completely consistent with the hypothesis that a new bubble is on its way.\n\nPut another way: You may have some other valid reason to give up and sell your coins -- but to do it because the price went from $1200 to $400 would not be rational.': 17, 'I agree with a lot of what you wrote, but you couldn\'t be more wrong with #7.

He said in a recent post that he worked on bitcoins for two years before he made any money, and he\'s probably one of the smartest people in bitcoins.  People like him just do work on bitcoins because they like them, and money comes second.  They are huge assets to the community - but most of the time they are just scraping by.\n\n2.  People like Mark Karpeles, Charlie Shrem, Daniel Brewster, the operators of BTC-e, Dread Pirate Roberts, and other shady characters.  These people are incompetent, don\'t follow regulations, plot to rip people off, or have some combination of those characteristics.  They are a huge drag on the community and result in losing money, crashes, bad publicity, and a constant source of problems.  It takes 25 or 50 group #1 programmers to recover from the damage caused by each of these guys.\n\n3.  People who create, pump, and dump useless altcoins like "einsteinium" and "infinitecoin" and "42coin" and schemes like Ethereum, where 22.5% of the money supply is devoted to "development activities."  They aren\'t doing anything to directly hurt or hinder bitcoins, but most of their time is just being wasted even if they do make themselves rich, and it\'s impossible to count the effort as "bitcoin programming."\n\n4.  People on online job boards who freelance for little money and who produce average quality products that work, but aren\'t groundbreaking.  Those job boards significantly underpay in contract work, and often (but not always) attract people who can\'t find steady work.\n\n5.  People like me, who work on bitcoin stuff every available minute to make money, but whose products take 5/2 times longer than the average person\'s to launch, or have 2/5 the featureset.  These people could make their products even better, but they still have to get up and go to work every day to make money.\n\n6.  People like the developers of buttercoin, which I mentioned earlier, who thought they could just start coding an exchange after the April 2013 Mt Gox crash and who continually promise a beta version "soon."  This also includes companies who work on their website first, which inevitably states that the product is in "pre-alpha testing."  People are convinced to buy shares in such companies and lose money when these developers never produce a product.\n\n7.  Mining equipment manufacturers, who neither hurt nor hinder bitcoins.  Bitcoins would work the same way whether there were 2m ASICs or 2 ASICs on the market, so this market just consists of companies spending lots of money to make people spend more money.\n\n8.  People who work full time programming for legitimate, taxpaying, registered bitcoin businesses, like Microsoft does with developing Windows.\n\n----------------\n\nAs you can see, the only category of people who can be legitimately compared to Microsoft in terms of producing valuable products that further bitcoins is #8.  It\'s difficult to determine what proportion of these 30,000 are in category #8, but 100% of Microsoft\'s employees fall in that category, while a far smaller percentage of bitcoin developers fall into it.\n\nAnd even if there were an equal number of Microsoft developers and #8 developers, most of the other categories are fractional (#4 and #5), zero (#3 and #7), or negative (#2 and #6).

Sacrifice a definitely non-vanishing number to internal competition, politics and re-orgs, random project cancellation, attrition, and bad ideas.  Count among their ranks the burnt-out and disillusioned who came in on acquisitions and you\'ll be approaching the real number of productive devs in the company.

': 3, ">05/05/2014\nPrevious paste: http://pastebin.com/BL6mxneP\n \n>At much request, here is my opinion of the ongoing China bitcoin saga.\n \n>The PBOC have set a deadline of May 10th for compliance of their notice, which is that no financial institutions should service directly or indirectly any bitcoin related business. So that means specifically, they may not run bank accounts for bitcoin related businesses and they may not service accounts which for example, service cash recharge codes for the purpose of funding or withdrawing money from bitcoin exchanges. In short, they are disconnecting the Chinese financial system from bitcoin completely. We know this is true because about 5 major banks have published notices to this effect and they specifically name recharge code as being unacceptable.\n \n>The result is simple, Chinese bitcoin exchanges will find it increasingly difficult to run their businesses at any scale. Moving offshore does not seem viable to me because the Chinese market will be unable to wire any significant funds due to currency controls... any Chinese that already have ways of getting money out can and probably do already work with existing USD exchanges.\n \n>A small and insignificant exchange, FXBTC announced they will be closing their doors on 10th May. While this announcement had no market moving effect, it sets the tone of what we can probably expect from the others http://www.fxbtc.com/news?id=4\n \n>\xe2\x80\x9cDue to the recent central bank's policy, we were unprecedented pressure, including the inability to recharge withdrawals, preventing normal operation, issues and other aspects of the decision-making difficult. [...] this time facing the central bank's long-term blockade, we can do nothing,[...] we finally decided stop operating FXBTC, in order to facilitate the user to cash, we will open the site until May 10, 2014, please the majority of users in the May 10 withdrawals as soon as possible, then we will close the site\xe2\x80\x9d.\n \n>There is a large bitcoin conference due to be held on 10th May in Beijing, notably sponsored by the major Chinese exchanges. However, today, according to Tim Swanson @ofnumbers, the Chines exchanges are taking the PBOC notices very seriously and will not be attending (ref: https://twitter.com/ofnumbers/status/463228429974773760). I have not been able to independently verify this, but given he recently met with Charlie Lee, brother of Bobby Lee of BTCChina, I believe his information is accurate.\n \n>There haven't been any negative announcements from the exchanges over the last 7 days of note, so there was little reason for a major sell-off, but in the absence of news there is little reason to buy either which is why we see slow overall decay rather than massive price movements. The Bloomberg price ticker news did provide an obvious pump opportunity for the market makers (polite term for those manipulating the price) to pump from $432 to $465 but inevitably, China overshadows and once that ran out of steam we returned to the slow decay we've been seeing.\n \n>On the manipulation side however, there has been a strong effort to maintain a floor at $424. This is definitely painting the tape. They could be trying to paint a new bottom (which could be used to fool people in either directions). Why this is the case is out of scope of this document, but the manipulation is clear as daylight to me. It makes defining support and resistance difficult when support and resistance are being contrived.\n \n>Now I can only speculate as to what happens from here. I expect the slow decay to continue until there is some news from Huobi or OKCoin. At that point there will be a sharp movement.\n \n>I cannot see how the Chinese exchanges can release anything good, but let's assume they do, I believe whatever pump ensues will epic, but short lived because there is really no hope for Chinese exchanges long term, that much is sure. If the news is bad it will put \xe2\x80\x9cthe China issue\xe2\x80\x9d to bed and hopefully markets will be able to disconnect (since fiat<->coin routes will be mainly cut off in China).\n \n>What seems strange is that given banks are going to prevent CNY withdrawals after the 10th May, it seems odd the exchanges wouldn't announce closure now, because after the 10th fiat in exchanges will become locked up and unable to leave via banking routes.\n \n>At Bitfinex, active USD swaps have declined from $18MM to $15MM and BTC swaps have increased to almost 10k BTC. Less people are betting long and more short. This is quite significant in my opinion (and dangerous if market makers are planning a squeeze).\n \n>So clearly we have about 5 days where is seems highly likely the Chinese exchanges will have to announce something. I am sure they are scrambling to save their businesses somehow, but the likely outcome seems certain.\n \n>I still maintain by 350-450 range as a safe long term buy range (whales have been seen buying in the 425-450 channel already), at the time of writing we're at $430. Given the amount of expectation, we're probably going to see $380-$410 when bad news comes. 5 days is a long time in the bitcoin world though. There have been banking holidays from last Thursday until today (Monday) meaning no fresh fiat into the exchanges will enter the exchanges until today.\n \n>However, I am beginning to slowly buy bitcoins again for long term hodl (https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=375643.msg4022997). I will still continue to trade on margin and now accumulate USD and buy more bitcoins simply because I believe the worst is almost over regarding China. If you are not a margin trader, I would buy bitcoin on the way down. Don't try to catch the bottom.\n \n>There is still a small possibility we crash below the recent low of $340 but I doubt we would remain at those levels for long (apart from anything I imagine bad news from China will actually bring relief for many traders i.e. certainty). So flash crashes are possible but those prices are not sustainable \xe2\x80\x93 and if history is anything to go by, we're probably near the bottom of this crash cycle. I would expect a few months of consolidation though to flush this China nightmare out of everyone's mind before resuming the bull trend.

It\'s not cool of us to basically shit on people in China doing the same thing we\'re doing, until the PBOC decided to end the party for everyone.

You\'re facing dipping bitcoin prices, they are facing the government shutting their business down and having people caught in the crossfire.\n\nHowever I am quite iffed by the exchanges pushing it as they do with the PBOC. The lack of clarity from both sides is really fucking annoying at this point. Also the PBOC rulings strike me as utterly extra-legal, I suppose that\'s why it\'s been playing this cat and mouse game rather than the government outright declaring a new policy and executing it.\n\nI\'m dreading another crash around the 10th, though I can imagine that a huge number of Chinese bitcoiners have already been shaken off. Buying bitcoins in China right now is exceptionally risky, and really not worth the effort. For all we know, all exchanges there could shut down completely by the end of this year and you\'re stuck with imaginary internet money. I suppose people could always migrate to somewhere and sell their bitcoins there later, but seriously how many people are there like that?

However, these people fail to understand that in China, it is easy to execute grand plans, like the one they are doing now to push down the price of bitcoins.  Their entire party meets regularly and adopts huge "five year plans" that list large numbers of goals they want to accomplish in the future.\n\nThe argument by some people in /r/bitcoin is that the US won\'t act until bitcoins are used by enough American citizens that they pose a threat to dollars.  But unlike in China, that\'s exactly the wrong time to act.\n\nIn the US, there is no "they" to participate in some grand conspiracy to suppress citizens.  That\'s the whole point.  Who, exactly, is going to declare bitcoins illegal?  The President is not authorized to just stand up and do that.  Congress can pass a law, but in this scenario, many people are using bitcoins already.  Those people aren\'t going to just stand by and reelect Senators who vote against them.  Even above money and prestige, Congressmen desire nothing more highly than to be reelected.\n\nIn China, pressure against bitcoins increases as more people use them.  In the US, pressure decreases, because once too many people start to care, representatives can\'t do anything about it, or they would rather spend political capital on an issue they care more about.\n\n\n2.\n---\nI was shocked yesterday by an article that proposes that 30,000 programmers (http://www.businessinsider.com/novogratz-on-bitcoin-and-banks-2014-5) are working on bitcoins in some capacity right now.  If that is the case, then bitcoins are massively, massively undervalued.\n\nBut first, we need to consider what a "programmer" is.  For the purpose of this study, is it a person who has a master\'s degree and who works 40 hours a week for full time pay?  Is it someone like me, who works 70 hours, but the 30 hours I work on bitcoins are a net loss (so far)?  Or, is it one of the many people who claim to be excited in bitcoins but make contributions to vaporware products like the buttercoin exchange that never see the light of day?\n\nPerhaps someone can verify if this 30,000 number is true (because I don\'t know what study it comes from).  If so, then if we set the average programmer\'s salary at $80k, the salaries of the programmers working on bitcoin alone are a significant proportion (at $2.4b) to the entire market capitalization of bitcoins.\n\n\n3.\n---\nI set aside my entire salary last month and put it in a checking account that is linked with Coinbase.  Along with money that was already there, I have a huge stake ready to press the "buy" button as soon as there is some upward movement.  Normally, I would have put this month into stocks, but instead it is sitting in the account waiting for a trigger.  The longer that passes, the more money I set aside.  I have never had more funds positioned to buy than this moment.\n\nI would imagine that there is a lot of money like this, just sitting in checking accounts waiting to explode.  Combined with the Bloomberg news and financial institutions getting involved, I think there is some reason to suspect that the 234-day cycle will be the same length as normal, but that the "struggling" phase will be brief and things are going to berserk faster than normal.\n\nAs soon as there is any movement, look for all this money, including mine, that is already earmarked for bitcoins to start pouring in.  A few weeks ago, /u/lowstrife predicted a massive short squeeze, which will contribute to the initial rise.\n\n\n4.\n---\nChina is falling apart, and yet the price has barely fallen between today and yesterday.  A major bank closed BTC China\'s accounts, and nobody cares anymore.  People are withdrawing from that May 10 conference, and nobody cares anymore.  And there is a joint statement by exchanges trying to salvage the Chinese bitcoin economy, and a few hours later, nobody cares anymore.\n\nAs stated earlier, this is a battle between the Chinese government and Wall St.  The battle is starting to swing in the opposite direction.\n\n\n5.\n---\nThe Bejing bitcoin conference is doomed.  As predicted, many of the speakers are dropping out under pressure from the government.  Within a few days, expect to hear that the venue was accidentally booked by another tenant, or that there are "repairs" that need to be made to the venue from some mysterious damage that occurred.\n\nEven if that doesn\'t happen, how is a conference going to be organized when nobody is willing to speak?  And who is going to want to speak after the biggest names in bitcoins are now too afraid to do so?\n\n\n6.\n---\nEverything is converging on this weekend.  /u/moral_agent\'s bubble chart, /u/emocmo\'s point and figure charts, the cryptocoinsnews.com articles, and various technical indicators all converge.

It hasn\'t been this overwhelmingly positive in months.  There\'s one post about the Chinese joint statement, and everything else is about products and services and new innovations.\n\nDon\'t get confused about this.  Remember, news does not drive the bubble cycle.  Rather, you can get an impression of where in the cycle we are by how the news is taken.

Bitcoin Core is still *beta*, and is far, far from finished, and will never really be "finished" as an active and developing technology. This is like the Internet in the early 90s, which saw its share of short sighted folks who couldn\'t see the potential, and now it touches literally everything you do. \n\n\n\n4. Bitcoin goes beyond just a currency. It is a new breed of distributed transaction engine. The concept of the blockchain will revolutionize everything beyond just money as we know it. The full potential of this has yet to be even tapped in a new generation of distributed applications with blockchains at their heart. \n\nYou come off like someone who saw some news on Fox and thinks they know something about this. The seasoned of Bitcoin users have been through other market downturns before and hold steadfast as a cost of being part of something so new. Bitcoin has never done what people expected, so how can you be so sure your un-researched predictions are iron clad?\n\n': 2, 'If you want to again just label valid criticisms and concerns about bitcoin as "bashing" then go ahead but that\'s not productive. I wouldn\'t have arguments to make if I heard realistic counter-arguments to any of the points I apparently constantly make. ': -2, "You're wrong but I'm flattered that you thought of me. Dude makes some good points, sorry you're upset about them. ": -1, "Thanks for the input. 1 internet for you. Here's where I stand on those issues:\n\n> The computing power required to verify transactions, meaning that fees end up being very high for small transactions.\n\nWhen I send bitcoin, I only pay a 0.0001 BTC fee. That's 4.3 cents at current prices. That's a lot cheaper than what credit card companies and PayPal charge. But yeah, for now microtransactions have to be done off the blockchain, like with /u/changetip. In the future, however, we'll probably see more clients supporting microtransaction channels: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=244656.0\n\n> The complexity...\n\nThe UX, you mean? I feel that's something that *can* be improved and that isn't fundamental to Bitcoin. The financial system outside of Bitcoin is itself pretty complex, yet that doesn't keep people from using it. The details in that particular world have just been handily abstracted away in a way that they haven't yet with Bitcoin.\n\nBut I'm just guessing at what you mean there. Complexity itself doesn't seem to me to be an argument for something failing, as there are a *lot* of complex systems in the world that work quite well. And complexity is relative anyway. To me, it's pretty simple. *<shrug>*\n\n> ...the high number of scams...\n\nWere you on the Web pre-PayPal and pre-Amazon? There were a lot of scams floating around back then. This is *not* a fundamental part of Bitcoin, but just a fact of its current state. There's no reason to think that legitimate enterprises won't prevail as time proves them to be trustworthy, crowding out the scammers as happened with the Web.\n\n> And the requirement of trust between strangers that can only be filled by an escrow service.\n\nThat one's pretty vague to me, but I'll take a swing at it anyway. Are you saying that irreversible transactions require trust between the parties making the transaction? Okay, yes. But so do reversible transactions. Theoretically, PayPal and the like act as escrow in those situations, but in my experience as a vendor on PayPal, they do a shitty job of it. If someone scams you, you're basically SOL. Granted, I was selling digital goods that didn't have any proof of shipping, so things might have been different if I'd had a shipping slip to scan and send in. I dunno.\n\nAt any rate, Bitcoin *does* allow for escrow at the protocol level via multisignature transactions. And it comes with the added advantage that the escrow agent cannot unilaterally lose or steal the funds entrusted to them. Nor can the agent block the transaction or freeze the accounts of the transaction participants. The parties can always use another agent or decide to transact directly. With PayPal and the like, it's a completely different story.\n\nI've done my best to address your concerns, but I feel I might have been misinterpreting some of them.

Bitcoin is NOT banned in China. In the Dec. 5th ruling they made it very clear that Chinese citizens are free to own, buy, sell, and trade bitcoin. Many people draw comparisons between the QQ currency a few years back and Bitcoin today.

There will always be workarounds. Unless Bitcoin or Bitcoin exchanges are banned outright(look above for my stance on that happening) there will always be a way for exchanges to operate. \n\nI feel like the atmosphere in China is much much better than it\xe2\x80\x99s perceived to be from the outside. This is anecdotal evidence, but nonetheless, I\xe2\x80\x99ve hopped into cabs here and had legitimate conversations with the cabbies about accepting Bitcoin. They knew what it was and had even heard of recent developments/price trends. For those of you who have been to Beijing you know that\xe2\x80\x99s a big deal because cabbies are hardly the techies here. Also, don\xe2\x80\x99t forget that much of the Bitcoin mining takes place in China. Furthermore, have you ever checked on how many exchanges there are in China? There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot. Can you think of any other country that has 3 large exchanges(Huobi, OKCoin, BTCChina) on a global scale? \n\nA major downside to Bitcoin in China is there is very little merchant adoption so it\xe2\x80\x99s not quite as useful. The major use of Bitcoin here is still speculation/investing. However, that is not to say that it is useless. I\xe2\x80\x99ve used bitcoin to transfer money from America to China multiple times and there\xe2\x80\x99s no better way to do it.

Again, (as a reminder), while banks have put the PBOC statement online, some of them still haven't closed BTC-related accounts yet. (E.g. China Construction Bank)\n\nFXBTC is probably the least shady exchange in the bunch of Chinese exchanges, and upon the release of the PBOC statement in early-April, FXBTC immediatly complied to the PBOC by closing their bank accounts extremely early on [[April 3rd]](https://www.fxbtc.com/news?id=2), leaving no way to deposit and withdraw through bank transfers. Therefore, they've been operating since then by using Caifutong, (or TenPay), another payment service. However, two days ago, Caifutong released the PBOC statement through their QQ channel [[Link]](http://t.qq.com/p/t/356763110147416), which now forces FXBTC to stop all operations before May 10th (deadline).\n\nWhat can we learn from this?\n\n* CNY (deposits and) withdrawals will be completely frozen upon bank account deletion. Again, FXBTC has explicitely stated that they couldn't process CNY withdrawal upon compliance with the banks in their early-April announcement.\n* As a consequence, all trading websites who operate with banks will be forced to shut down when all banks enforce the PBOC statement, leaving them no way to deposit or withdraw CNY. (Around ~10 banks left). BTCChina probably doesn't apply, as they have plans to release ATMs, unless those are banned too.\n* However, the May 10th deadline (as I said earlier) is probably only for banks releasing the PBOC statement, and not actually enforcing it. So we may have to wait a bit longer.\n\nAs for now, OKCoin, BTCChina, Huobi, etc. are still cycling through banks allowing BTC-related transactions. (e.g. OKCoin still allows recharge through CCB)\n": 16, "The same reason every exchange followed China's lead down last night.

The flow from that highly managed  space to the bitcoin space is ramping up like crazy though.\n\nThat\'s a huge, under-tracked metric for growth of the bitcoin economy, by the way: flow of jobs away from traditional financial into the bitcoin financial worlds. No idea how to track it, but ... put a gun to my head and I\'d say that\'s a leading indicator.\n\nThe day JP Morgan chase publicly talks about a) mining centers or b) hand crafting their own protocol for internal wealth transfers, I am doubling down on all my crypto.': 6, 'I don\'t have all that much to say today, both because there simply isn\'t all that much that is happening and also because I spent my breakfast dealing with personnel problems with my mining pool.\n\n1.\n----\nOne of our employees, while a good worker, has not been contributing as many hours as the others have.  Not only is that going to delay the project because I need to do his work, but also because I have to spend hours discussing with people what to do about it and following up with the employee to come up with a plan.\n\nThis reminded me that the most needed skillset in bitcoins right now is not developers, but managers.  I wish I could simply hire a CEO to boss people around, keep on top of everyone\'s performance, interview new employees, determine what features need to be added, file paperwork, and to deal with the public.  That way, I can focus on the actual technical work that needs to be done.\n\nAs you can see with incidents like Mt Gox, I am not the only one who laments this shortage.  This shortage of managers in bitcoins is underreported, and is likely hampering development of the space just as much as a lack of attention to protocol issues is.\n\n\n2.\n---\nLook at what /u/campassi demonstrates in this link (http://imgur.com/a/YzG7K), which compares what happened in July with what happened now.

Keep in mind that these numbers are far higher because people who *downvoted* those posts are also participants, so for all we know, there could be 100 upvotes and 70 downvotes.\n\nI think that more people than we realize read posts here, and the groups of people who move markets aren\'t stupid.  They go everywhere they can to get information, including here.  The Chinese government doesn\'t stay in power by being ignorant of upcoming trends, and Wall Street traders scour the Internet for rumors upon which to trade.  While there are certainly other sources of information that these people also consider when making decisions, there is no doubt that a few of the lurkers in this forum are people who have lots of money or lots of power.

The red line just tracks directly on top of the other lines, sometimes within hours of the dips and falls.\n\n\n#2\n----\nLook at how odd it is that China would choose a Saturday as its next deadline for banks to close accounts.  Every other deadline has been on a weekday.  It is no coincidence that the bitcoin conference is on the same day as this deadline.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the Chinese react.  Will they take this as the opportunity to declare bitcoins illegal and try to arrest people attending the conference?  A better way might be to set up now and then be ready to shut down all the exchanges right in the middle of the conference for maximum disruption, making it difficult for the conference to get anything accomplished.\n\nI know if I were a speaker and I just heard that the government had closed all exchanges, I would be very careful what I said.  This is why I criticize people who say that the United States isn\'t a free society; they have no idea.\n\n\n#3\n----\nThe Bloomberg ticker news is being significantly underestimated.  Financial types use Bloomberg as the place to get quotes and information about assets.  If it isn\'t in Bloomberg, it doesn\'t exist.\n\n\n#4\n----\nThis is the start of the phase where Wall St is increasing its influence, and the Chinese have little influence left.  The day that Wall Street\'s influence is greater than the Chinese will likely coincide with the "crossover" people have been talking about, and the start of the upswing into the next bubble.\n\n\n#5\n----\nAssuming that the next bubble proceeds successfully, and there is no reason to think that it won\'t, the conversation around here is going to fundamentally change.  Right now, people are afraid that bitcoins will never catch on and will become useless.  After Wall St invests in bitcoins, it will be clear that the only way that bitcoins will fail is if there is a protocol disaster.  For five years now, bitcoins have always had a cloud over them about whether they would fail or not.  It will be difficult for people here to adjust to that change in reality.\n\nIt will be even more difficult to adjust for people at bitcointalk.org, who have been following a set of electronic tokens that were considered a waste of electricity, but which are now listed on Bloomberg as a new asset class and which the People\'s Republic of China is failing in its efforts to destroy even with full government support.\n\nOnce it is clear that bitcoins won\'t fail, it would also stand to reason that the bubble cycle will be dampened somewhat.  Wall St investors don\'t panic as quickly as all the script kiddies and drug dealers do.  Bubbles will continue for some time, but perhaps two bubbles from now would go from $6k to $12k, instead of the 6x increases that have been common before that.\n\n\n#6\n----\nNote, however, that if you buy bitcoins now, a 2x increase two bubbles from now is still better for you than a 6x increase would be now.  A 1.6x increase three bubbles from now is even better yet.  The slowdown in the rate of increase will only hurt those who get in late, not the people here right now.\n\n\n#7\n----\nThere is a strategy called "turtle investing" that doesn\'t require you to look at complex charts or take huge risks in calling the bottom.  You simply buy when the price crosses the all-time high, and sell at the first crash of 25% or so.

There are far too many people proclaiming to be prophets on this sub-reddit who likely have not been involved with bitcoin from day one. They have likely only been involved from late last year.\n\nMy next point..... India, like China has an incredibly huge population. In fact it is around 1.2 billion. They are an absolute powerhouse of a nation so any involvement by them should not be disregarded.\n\nIndia is incredibly gold rich and is hugely more advanced than the western world thinks. The country is filled with incredibly intelligent people who who may or may not push bitcoin into its next phase.\n\nThe biggest problem in my view is that the exchange is possibly mismanaged (though I hope this will be rectified asap).

I think because they also got bored or exactly know which direction it is going.\n\nFor me, I have a very clear and strong believe.\nIts going down, and it will go down at least as long as BTCChina, Huobi and OKCoin suspend their operations.\n\nI kind of don\'t get the people around here who are still screaming "lulz bubble watch, 34 days till ATH" or want to tell me that in less than a week we will be headed for +200$.\n\nGuys, lets be realistic here. You know that day when charlie shrem was arrested? You know that day when gox was taken offline?\n\nThese are the things that can and probably will happen in the next couple of weeks.\nJust think about what happens to the bitcoin price once sina is releasing an article about for example bobby lee being arrested, or about huobi closing doors.\n\nTwo weeks ago I posted: \n> For fuck\'s sake! I\'m so angry right now, but as a wise man once said: "Don\'t fight the trend guys".\n\nand someone responded with:\n> I hate to be the guy that says it, but the fact that you\'re angry right now is exactly why you\'re on the wrong side of a trade. I\'m sure you know this though.\n\nWhat can I say. I went short on that day, setting up a stop loss +10$ higher. I\'m still in that very short and while I\'m making a little bit of money right now I\'m still waiting for the one and only choxing-headline to hit.\n\n\nI also wanted to make a point about vc capital streaming into bitcoin.\nCapital invested in startups alone will not immediately after being announced rise the price, BUT the products that are being created with that very money will.\n\nI give you an example here: You probably know [xapo](https://xapo.com/#home). It was one of the startups receiving a recordbreaking about of vc capital. Meeh, who cares...\nBut wait, on april 24th, they announced a bitcoin creditcard that lets you [pay with the bitcoins in your online wallet](https://xapo.com/in/campaign/debit/).\nNow this is what I call FUCKING bullish news.\nJust think about it, going to dinner with your girlfriend, paying the expensive bill with your badass bitcoin credit card. I mean, how cool is that!\n\nSo to sum this up. Ultimately vc capital will cause the price to rise, but what really will cause the price to rise is adoption. I particular awesome applications for bitcoin.\n\nEdit: words\n\n': 9, 'They often "run out of bitcoins" during those periods when the price is rising, but I\'ve never seen them prevent people from selling.  When they run out, they promise to fill orders several days later at the market price then.\n\nBut when people sell bitcoins in the interim, new buyers can get those bitcoins even before the previous buyers, who had to wait, receive them.\n\nI don\'t see how they would be at risk, unless they don\'t have enough money in their bank accounts to cover huge sales like that. Surely, as a huge company, they would have $50k available.\n\nMy greatest fear is that if there is a new bubble, and the price rises $1000 per hour for a few hours, then I can lose tens of thousands of dollars not because I made a bad decision, but because there was no way to get rid of my bitcoins quickly enough.  If you think that such rises sound insane, then look at what happened on the Monday before Thanksgiving week.': 2, 'Well, the difficulty would go down, proportionately to the "lost" hashrate. The amount of bitcoins generated per day will remain the same though.': 1, 'Some comments for today:\n\n1\n---\nYou can see that the turnaround is happening by the predominant news that is coming out of the newspapers.  There have been more Chinese exchanges than ever closing up shop; yet, all the news is about new products, services, and controversies about the protocol itself.\n\n\n2\n---\nMaybe people still do pay attention to flairs.  Historically, the bulls-to-bears ratio is a leading indicator.  As you can see at http://coinsight.org/reddit, it has been increasing significantly over the past two weeks.\n\n\n3\n---\nTo me, this isn\'t surprising at all.  Even if this bubble phase lasts longer than the 234-day cycle predicts, it seems to me that everyone, especially those who frequent /r/bitcoin, have very volatile emotions.  It\'s as if this hasn\'t all happened before over and over again.\n\nI\'m wondering if the reason why so many people get worried every time there is another fall is because a large number of people haven\'t been around for more than one bubble.  Therefore, I creased a "poll" that I replied to this post.  Downvote the post that most appropriately reflects your situation, and we\'ll see what the proportions are.\n\nI edited this post because someone sent me a message asking why you should downvote the posts.  I\'m not sure what the rules here are, but in /r/bitcoin, they are worried about karma and if you make a post asking people to upvote it, you get banned.  This is a way to avoid that.  The downside is that the "comment score is below threshold," so you need to click the plus sign.\n\n\n4\n---\nI started the process this week of having family members open Coinbase accounts.  The reason is that Coinbase\'s sell limit is only $50,000, but with multiple accounts, we can get rid of huge numbers of bitcoins in an emergency, should the price start rising too fast.\n\nRemember that in November, the price started going up at a rate of $100/hr.  In April, it was rising at $10/hr before that bubble ended.  In both cases, it was only hours until it was all over.  When this happens, you don\'t want to get caught unable to liquidate.  Coinbase is an effective means of selling instantly and having the money be transferred to your bank account within 4 days, without worrying about funds being in the hands of unknown Eastern Europeans who charge hefty withdrawal fees (or, you have to buy back in to withdrawal, which is very risky in times of high volatility).\n\nIt is important to start the process now so that you have an account available whenever the next bubble occurs.  Coinbase\'s default sell limit is $3000, and that may not be enough to sell even one bitcoin.  It takes 34-37 days from the time you open an account until you get the "level 2" limits, so you can\'t just decide on a whim to open an account when prices start going up.  Even if you were able to get verified at an exchange (Bitstamp never replied when I sent my passport), it\'s still worth having a backup plan.\n\n\n5\n---\nI strongly oppose any effort to change the default unit of bitcoins to "bits."  I\'m going to make an effort to express this opposition in as many forums, threads, and polls as possible without being a troll today and tomorrow.  The problem is that the word is already commonly defined and used in another context.\n\nImagine a system where people pay to listen to music.  You associate a wallet with the site, and the next to a song it says "128 kilobits."  What does that mean?  Does it mean that the song\'s bitrate is a common MP3 standard that has been in use for a while?  Or, does it mean that you have to pay 128 millibitcoins to listen to it?\n\nPeople think that the system now is confusing; just wait until that sort of stuff starts showing up.  If developers want to move decimal places, then choose a different name for the things.  Every other currency system in the world has two completely unrelated terms.  Nobody gets confused between "cents" and "dollars."\n\nMy stance is to do nothing, and to continue using the commonly accepted terms like mBTC and uBTC, because metric notation is well understood in all countries except one.  If an official word is needed, call them "microcoins," which is easy to say and the relationship with bitcoins makes sense.\n\nThis push towards "bits" is a disaster.  If someone wants to come up with some other, less confusing, slang for uBTC, then I would be willing to change my mind.  In the meantime, when my pool launches on May 24, all units will be displayed in uBTC, mLTC, DGC, and so on, even if others choose to use the word "bit."': 19, 'This thread got me thinking. Millibit, microbit and uBit all have "bit" in common. It\'s inevitable that bit will become the slang for *any* of these. Why not just be done with it and call it a Bit?

Bitcoin promised to cut those fees for the merchant, and anticipated lower product prices in exchange for saving that merchant money. I've seen that sentiment parroted on reddit a billion times, but people were *immediately* willing to forsake that benefit to the merchant for the convenience of a CC. Using Xapo's card would have eliminated any benefit of Bitcoin to the merchants, and essentially negated a large part of Bitcoin's niche. No use to develop things much further, and merchants would have a bigger disincentive to accept bitcoin directly\n\nOh, I forgot, they also want to charge $15 for each card, above-market rates to reload, and the regular bitcoin transaction fee.

Mining today is an unprofitable business, no matter the electricity cost.\n\nAs a consequence, miners who are in for quick profit, i.e. small miners, will soon halt (or already have) their mining operations. Speculators who can't break even will also halt their operations, as it's easier to simply buy BTC directly from the market. \n\nSo who is mining now? My guess is 1. miners who truly support Bitcoin's infrastructure and long-term development, 2. mining facilities (e.g. KnCMiner) who generate a daily profit despite the difficulty because of custom hardware, and 3. mining facilities that generate Bitcoins for other purposes, such as capital flight theory (I'm speculating)\n\n* *What is the next move of Chinese miners?*\n\nSo unless it's #3, Chinese miners will halt their mining operations. 1.

Never feel like you *have* to make a trade. It's OK to wait it out and just watch if you don't see a blindingly obvious opportunity. Feeling like you need to make a trade since the market moved, without having a strong idea of what will happen, results in panic trading and burning money on fees/spread as you rapidly open and close positions.\n\n2. Related to that, absolutely never trade with the goal of making back losses. It's an extremely dangerous mindset that invariably results in throwing good money after bad - I've seen many people do this, and it's just sad to watch.\n\n3. Always use stoplosses. Pick your stoploss price when you open the position *and stick to it* (don't cancel the stoploss or close at a loss before your stop is hit), and there is no emotion involved in choosing when and whether to cut losses.\n\n4. Perhaps obvious, but if you feel like your trades are heavily affected by emotion, try reducing how much you trade with.\n\nI could write up more (f.ex. covering 'I often tend to panic sell/buy when I see major short term price movements') but it's not really related to your main question.

I could have bought on #bitcoin-otc when the price was $8-12. In fact I intended to put in $1,000 but never did; it just felt too risky. Did I miss a huge opportunity? Yes. Do I kick myself for it?

You could easily panic and sell to cut losses when it went from 0.025 to 0.024 and then to 0.023 but if you just hold on the extra day or two it jumped back up to 0.025.\n\nThe same goes for trading against USD. There are obvious movements and swings that you can easily make cash on, you just need to set your limits and not go past them.\n\nI would also recommend against doing too much during times like these.

My main tips:\n\n1 - Ignore the majority of posts on reddit and especially any 'trader' info blogs\n\n2 - Buy a bunch of btcoins now and start trading with a small portion of them over the next few weeks. Keep 90% of them in your wallet while the rest in an exchange. While trading keep multiple bitcoin-wisdom windows open to the main exchanges. Learn to read them and ignore the vast majority of charts posted on reddit. Remember a chart may look nice here but you dont know if it was created by a genius or a child doing it for fun.\n\n3 - Use the remaining  10% to trade. Dont panic when the price goes waaaaaaaaaaay down. You will likely get back in tomorrow or at the latest, next week.\n\n4 - Spend the next month trading with your 10%. If you have lower than that at the end of the month get out of trading.

Will 10 million schmucks line up and buy less than $400 in bits? Maybe, and that would cause the price to go up quite a lot.

However it is likely that they did work with PBOC to bring you this article.. (Caixin is known for having access to insider info)\n\n* FXBTC has shut down on May 9th instead of May 10th, stealing the assets of tons of people who thought they could withdraw on May 10th. The site and its operators have been unreachable since then. Their customer service went offline, they cancelled their QQ channel, no one answers the phone anymore, etc.\n\n* Therefore, the central bank doesn\'t wish to allow large transactions with exchanges as they hold the funds and can commit fraud (FXBTC)\n\n* There is no doubt that each trading website will need to be regulated. As for Bitcoin, PBOC could have banned all trading of the digital currency (Article 20, institutional or individual trading) but have been very tolerant up to today, as they believe it is a commodity that should be legally tradable via cash (individual trading). Therefore, to protect the users from fraud (such as FXBTC), from illegal use and other reasons (Article 20, competition to RMB, institutional trading), they won\'t allow large transactions and will only allow trade via cash-only methods. In other words, exchanges are allowed to keep platform features online as long as there is no margin trading, no HFT (fees), no high-volume trading and cash-only trading (no access to banking system).\n\n\n__TL;DR__ Exchanges allowed to run as long as no margin trading, no HVT, no HFT, no banking system. They are allowed to run as medium allowing individual transactions (if that makes sense).\n\n*Disclaimer* : Again, this is my interpretation. As to not spread wrong information, I\'ll try to get an official translation from a native Chinese soon and will update accordingly. However, do expect severe regulation of exchanges.

I am tempted to agree with /u/petertodd that bitcoin's unique contribution to the world as a fully decentralized, un-censorable consensus machine depends on small blocks. The high bandwidth demanded by very large blocks will make it expensive to run a full node.\n\nI don't think there is any kind of cliff we are going to fall off. /u/gavinandresen recently pointed out that as we approach the 1M limit, what will happen is the transaction fees will rise. Supply and demand dictate that if more people want to make a transaction, the price will go up until enough people get discouraged and stop trying to make a transaction.\n\nPerhaps this is fine. Maybe if it costs $10 or $50 to write something in the blockchain, that's fine, and rather than be a consumer technology, bitcoin will be used as a component in a new trust model which uses off-blockchain record keeping to handle the volume, and then hits the blockchain for settlement and auditing. Maybe safeguarding the purchase of a dessert-like coffee drink with the unbreakable global ledger is like killing a spider with a grenade. In that world, bitcoins can still be used directly as investment vehicles, or to back investment vehicles. Bitcoin is going to have an uphill battle competing with credit cards for convenient consumer experience anyway.\n\nOr maybe it is fine for the blocks to get bigger, and for the bitcoin economy to trust a handful of people with big internet connections to be honest about what is in the blockchain, and to be the gatekeepers about what gets into the blockchain.\n\nOr maybe some way of sharding is found to be workable, such that different people around the world can work on local parts of the blockchain (blocknet? blocktree?), and even though they do not have knowledge of every transaction, nevertheless they can prove that double spending is not occurring.

": 15, 'I largely agree with you on what makes for a good dev.  People tend to conflate different definitions of "lazy".   \n\nStupid and lazy devs haven\'t made it into the companies I\'ve been in.   A number of devs seemed to be stupid and lazy relative to the rockstars, but they could produce even though they were at the bottom of our review curves.  They tended to fall into niches -- installation, build system, maintenance or a particular finicky technology stack we relied on -- and earned their keep.   They were vulnerable to re-orgs or innovations which obsoleted their skills.  \n\nThere are developers that are quite intelligent, but don\'t put the time in to become really skilled in anything.  They\'re sufficiently smart to come up to speed on something quickly enough to be useful on small projects, but when they run into a task that\'s hard and takes effort, they give up.  They don\'t put in much time into their craft outside of work, and tend to be motivated by praise.  They might have a good year or two, but inevitably wash out.   Weeding out never stops in strong organizations.  "What have you done for me lately" for devs is "what new skillsets have you mastered recently?" \n\nThere are intelligent developers who appear lazy from the point of view of day-in-and-day out work.  They spend a huge amount of time learning what interests them, and learning how to automate a lot of what they do so they don\'t have to do "grunt work."   They aren\'t really lazy, they just don\'t align their priorities with those of their employer.  If they manage to survive in a company long enough, they eventually learn how to align and they can be tremendously useful at bringing everyone\'s productivity up.  Savvy managers recognize these types early on and harness their skills.    \n\nThe 4-box assessments can be useful heuristically when comparing devs.  Lazy vs Intelligent is less useful than "Gets a lot of good work done" vs "Makes a lot of waves"  or "Cracks the really hard problems" vs "Gets a lot of work done"  or "Gets a lot of work done" vs "makes those around him much better".

That would leave us with a long-overdue uptrend rather than continuing a downtrend.\n\nFurthermore, saying that we'll continue far below pre-China support levels (sub $300) well into June makes even less sense. We have incoming, desired regulations for the industry, we have conferences and summits positive for Bitcoin (some of them with very big names in Congress) happening every months or so.

You can then detect and quantify an intelligence by how effective it is. You then have another quantity we call knowledge which is the storage and transfer medium of intelligence. A lever is embodied knowledge, which originated in an intelligence.\n\nThat's my favorite definition of intelligence (there are of course other academic ways to define it, including as a gradient that preserves entropy). With this definition you can view a lazy developer as more intelligent if his code is tighter, more elegant and more effective. He appears lazy because his goal is to use the least resources, including time and effort. His intelligence allows him to achieve laziness without a drop in production.\n\nSo if you believe this example, then it muddies any attempt to evaluate developers based on performance.\n\nTotally agree with the rest of the post.

Even if you use general tests like IQ scores, which aren\'t even accurate for adults, they have to be continually be readjusted as education improves and people become smarter over time.\n\nTherefore, most developers fall in the "smart and motivated" or "dumb and lazy" categories, which is why I\'ve said there aren\'t many people in the other two squares of the chart.\n\n\n3.\n---\nIn her latest expos\xc3\xa9, Kashmir Hill returns to the streets and tries to live for a week on bitcoins only.  Unfortunately, the results are discouraging.  While she has, so far, found more uptake than previously, she has also discovered that many businesses have poorly-integrated POS systems or (worse) have stopped accepting bitcoins altogether.\n\nBusinesses stopping accepting bitcoins is worrysome.  If it is widespread, then educated investors need to figure out why those businesses have stopped.\n\nOn the other hand, this series of articles bodes well for the price of bitcoins.  If the current price is based upon many fewer businesses than we thought accepting bitcoins, and it has finished falling, then we are far earlier in the adoption curve than expected, and there is far more money to be made.\n\n\n4.\n---\nI did some thinking about what the remaining threats to widespread bitcoin adoption are.  I had planned to list them here, but after stewing over them, I only came up with one: the upcoming bubble goes way too high and the 1MB transaction limit is reached, so that transaction fees become so high that they choke off the network and transform it into something less valuable.\n\nThe reason why I see that as the only real risk is that in all of the other doomsday scenarios, like a terrorist attack financed by bitcoins, the network remains untouched and eventually resurrects itself once the political pressure fades, or continues to be used elsewhere.\n\nThe 1MB transaction limit is such an insidious problem because it is the only scenario that actually affects the nature of bitcoins themselves.  Reaching the limit reduces the value of your wallet, because rising transaction fees would essentially inflate the currency, taxing your savings.  Unlike the other catastrophes, in this scenario, people who want to use the network can\'t continue using it as they did previously.\n\n\nOther\n---\n* Today\'s irrelevant fact: in my quest to see what can be predicted other than bitcoins, I discovered today that phenology (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenology) is the science of predicting natural plant and animal events.  It turns out that for every 100 feet in elevation, 100 miles north, or 100 miles west from the coast (at least on the eastern half of the US), the leafing dates of trees are delayed by one day.  Apparently, you can predict when the trees will grow leaves by looking at when trees at a lower elevation did.  So I looked at pictures of the White House on April 28, saw that many of the trees in the background were green, computed that I live 1300 feet higher, 150 miles north, and 150 miles west of Washington, and can predict that the forest should start growing leaves on May 14.  It\'s amazing how much knowledge is available in any field to predict future events.\n\n* Days until July 24: 77': 23, 'Oh man, that was fun to read': 8, 'apart from b-e-a-u tiful becasue jim carrey taught me ohw': 2, "Let's hope it does the go-uppy thing that people are so fond of.": 3, 'For the most part, I agree with you.

It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble (or [economic bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble)),  although some researchers have noted that the *[Kipper- und Wipperzeit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kipper_und_wipperzeit)* episode in 1619\xe2\x80\x9322, a Europe-wide chain of [debasement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debasement) of the metal content of coins to fund warfare, featured mania-like similarities to a bubble.  The term "tulip mania" is now often used metaphorically to refer to any large economic bubble (when asset prices deviate from [intrinsic values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(finance\\))). \n\n>The 1637 event was popularized in 1841 by the book *[Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extraordinary_Popular_Delusions_and_the_Madness_of_Crowds)*, written by British journalist [Charles Mackay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Mackay). According to Mackay, at one point 12 [acres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acre) (5 ha) of land were offered for a *Semper Augustus* bulb.  Mackay claims that many such investors were ruined by the fall in prices, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Although Mackay\'s book is a classic that is widely reprinted today, his account is contested. Many modern scholars feel that the mania was not as extraordinary as Mackay described and argue that not enough price data are available to prove that a tulip bulb bubble actually occurred.  \n\n>====\n\n>[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/CQ0hI6w.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Tulipomania.jpg) - *A tulip, known as "the Viceroy", displayed in a 1637 Dutch catalog.

Every time there is a price drop of a few dollars, some people begin talking as if it is a harbinger of doom to come.\n\nThis is bitcoins.  The price rises and drops frequently.  People who think that this latest "crash" of $20 was very significant obviously weren\'t around last year, when there would be $20 swings at much lower prices.    Instead, people should be noticing that the news gets worse and worse, and the pricing effects get less and less.\n\n\n2.\n---\nOn a similar note, why does everyone change their flairs to bearish right after these crashes occur?  Isn\'t the point to make money?  One way to lose the game for sure is to change your flair to bullish every time the price starts moving up, and to change it to bearish right after every crash.\n\n\n3.\n---\nI\'ve now invested my full stake.  You might recall that I earlier mentioned buying a bitcoin on Thursday, and then eight more on Friday.  I decided to buy everything because:\n\n* The bubble chart has always superseded all other TA or news.\n* Even if the bubble cycle is broken this time, the price won\'t remain low for long, and will probably be low in the middle of the night.\n* Most importantly, the price of bitcoins is going to be so high a few bubbles from now that it will be irrelevant whether I bought 1/6 more bitcoins at $350.\n* The fundamentals of bitcoins are unchanged, and at any point, something big can and will happen that is going to sweep any Chinese news under the rug.\n\nIn addition, I will never sell any bitcoins that the mining pool makes after launch.  My big worry is that, since my employees have not been as motivated as I have been to get it to launch, the bubble will occur first and we will earn fewer bitcoins, even if those bitcoins are worth more money.\n\n\n4.\n---\nHow many actual investors are there in China?  The only exchanges with significant volume are the zero-fee exchanges, so there could be many bots on these exchanges from the West.  Most of China consists of extreme poverty, people who could care less about things like this.  And the marketplaces started by these exchanges have very few "trusted sellers."\n\nConsider how ludicrous it is that the Chinese government releases news with some deadline months in the future, and five minutes later everyone sells.  The news itself obviously isn\'t causing people to sell within five minutes, because actual Chinese people can still do the same thing tomorrow if they wanted to.  At this point, everyone knows that bitcoins will be illegal in China; the price action consists mainly of people who think that there is going to be another drop.\n\nBut as the bubble cycle is starting to turn, those people are losing money, so the drops are getting less.\n\n\n5.\n---\nThis bad news doesn\'t have to stop completely for the bubble cycle to continue on schedule.  Instead, as you can see has been happening over the past few days, the price begins to rise, but the crash doesn\'t go down to a level below the beginning of the last rise.  Then the price rises above the level before the previous crash, and the Chinese government releases more news that only temporarily slows the rise.\n\n\n6.\n---\nI can\'t help but wonder if the Chinese could have done a better job at what they are trying to do.  The only new thing they can do at this point is to arrest some exchange operator over some white-collar crime.  They can\'t close any more bank accounts, or place restrictions on charge codes, or censor conferences any more than they already have.\n\nThey erred in taking their actions too quickly.  A better tactic would have been to stretch out the timetable across an entire bubble cycle or longer, putting more time between each action.  They could have done much more damage if they were still at the stage of cancelling bank accounts during the next uptrend.\n\n\n7.\n---\nPeople who are waiting for the lines on the chart to converge before making a decision are going to lose money.  If you plan to buy, make a decision on what is going to happen when the lines converge and follow through.  By the time the lines converge, everyone else will have already bought or sold.\n\n\n8.\n---\nIf you have a great product to release, please release it and let your product speak for itself.  Don\'t put up a flashy website with a countdown timer that says "revolutionary colored coins coming in X hours..."  We have enough flashy marketing and not enough working stuff around here.\n\n\nOther\n---\n* The most insidious bugs in development are generally not complex system design features, but simple typos and math errors.

The most serious smackdown from the PBOC - the one that will cut the flow of Chinese money in/out of their exchanges - is yet to come. I don\'t think we\'ll see China\'s influence in bitcoin cut sharply until the money flow stops, which hasn\'t happend yet! \n\nFrom http://www.pymnts.com/in-depth/2014/alibabas-eyepopping-ipo/\n> Yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s filing revealed that that draft regulations by the People\xe2\x80\x99s Bank of China (PBOC) currently under consideration would cap the amount that a buyer could spend on Alipay at around $800 for a single transaction or at about $1,600 per month in aggregate. The regulations would also limit transfers of money using Alipay to around $160 per transaction and $1,600 per year, which would severely impact consumers ability to invest in the Alipay-controlled money-market fund Yu\xe2\x80\x99e Bao, which is currently the world\xe2\x80\x99s fourth largest money-market fund.\n\nConsider [how big and influential](http://qz.com/206283/all-the-western-companies-youd-have-to-combine-to-get-something-like-alibaba) Alibaba is, yet they are being asked to severely limit deposits for investment purposes. Yu\xe2\x80\x99e Bao offers returns of 5-8% vs. 3% at Chinese banks, and these restrictions should make it mighty obvious that the PBOC and other regulators feel threatened enough to substantially restrict it. \n\nThere are couple reasons I\'ve seen for this. The government in recent years encouraged banks to pour money into investments like real estate, and greased the wheels by increasing the money supply, but now it looks like many of those loans [won\'t get paid back](http://www.ibtimes.com/zhejiang-xingrun-default-chinas-property-market-risk-concentrates-3rd-4th-tier-cities-1562026). If many people started moving money out of their bank accounts, the banks that hold non-performing loans will face insolvency. The government will soon be faced with printing even more money to get out of the crisis. \n\nSound familiar? It is similar to 2007/2008 crash in the US except the yuan gets diluted at a much quicker rate than the dollar, despite all the dread over printing too much money in the US. Here, the real estate crash started in the lower tier markets like Florida but quickly spread to more affluent areas. I expect the same happen in China. A big warning sign is that healthy banks in China don\'t want to give out short term overnight/weekly loans to other banks, for fear that they too will get caught up in this mess. The troubled banks can only cover losses from poorly performing long term loans with short term ones for so long, before everything comes crashing down. It is a game of musical chairs and the more prudent banks don\'t want to be caught without a seat when they were acting responsibly in the first place.\n\nThe wider backdrop is that China has gotten a great advantage over the years by printing money at a faster rate than competing countries. Over decades this carefully engineered play has kept it cheap for foreigners to buy Chinese products at the expense of diluting its own citizen\'s savings. Both of these elements are important because much of China is still impoverished, and 80% of the wealth from capitalistic "reforms" have gone to those connected with the communist party. If your unfamiliar with these reforms read up on Shenzen and the special economic zone. Manufacturing is restricted to certain areas that make up a minority of the country, and people are not allowed to freely travel outside their own provinces to open international businesses. Dilution is key to ensuring exports remain cheap so that job growth will continue and reach the wider population, and also to ensure that the super wealthy that are seen as corrupt get a haircut. If big job growth doesn\'t come, and wealthy officials are able to preserve massive wealth, things may not end well for the Chinese government.\n\nNow consider that if an alternative investment option like AliPay\'s Yu\'e Bao is seen as a threat, where does that leave bitcoin? I would think at minimum a $1600/year transfer limit will be slapped on the exchanges, or even an outright withdraw/deposit ban. That is why I am waiting for bad news from the May 14th/15th China Financial Summit. All the major national regulators will be meeting and will likely put out a unified response that doesn\'t care about the agreement exchanges made amongst themselves. That self-made agreement limits capital flight (id checks) and big price swings (margin trading stopped), but doesn\'t address what I\'d consider the most pressing concerns of the PBOC.': 22, 'Chinese exchanges are playing with fire ([05/12](http://tech.sina.com.cn/z/bitcoindown/))\n\nHow do they recharge funds?\n\n* BTCChina are selling their coupon codes through Taobao by bypassing the words restriction of Alipay (no "bitcoin" words in the description of their trading item).\n\n* Huobi asks their customers to transfer funds to very specific accounts and leave a note with their user ID, so they can "prepay" their account upon login\n\nAnd then, they say [quoting the article] "we want to be regulated, but no regulation authority wants to contact us".\n\nIt\'s a sad situation for them, as they\'re really trying to find ways to bypass the regulations and keep their platforms in a working state but will soon violate the law, e.g. private transfers promotes tax evasion, competition to RMB, etc. PBOC doesn\'t want to contact them, BTCChina says they\'ve never received a single document from the central bank. All they had were notices from their banks progressively closing their accounts.\n\nSo here\'s their current dilemma: Keep bypassing regulations like children, or accept defeat and be severely regulated in a way it\'s simply not profitable for anyone.

But anyone can set up this test.  I will look into doing it this weekend with Kraken as they also provide a server timestamp that I can sync with.  \n\nDelay considerations:  I assume you are only talking about the delay for my service to publish to PubNub and for a given client to receive it from PubNub.  The delay for making requests to each individual exchange would be the same for everyone depending on their region/network route to the service; and my nodes auto prioritize by 15 minute sample performance every minute.  So if the route from Singapore to ANX Pro starts having issues it will automatically switch over to another node.\n\nHere are my current metrics for network bound calls:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15q91SngclsXGBvLKCgEmQ5bQYqIh1dZsgHh1YJ2WU-4/edit?usp=sharing\n\nThe Call Duration value for the PubNub ticker row doesn't actually capture how long it takes to get to a subscribed client.  It is the duration from when I initially publish to when I get an asynchronous call back from PubNub to confirm delivery.  Spot checking the data on the PubNub dev console the actual delay is far less than 5 seconds. However, the time servers are not synced between PubNub and whatever created the timestamp on the ticker (either the exchange or my service if not provided by the exchange).  So I will need to set up a test to do this sampling.\n\nAlso, PubNub has a 99.999% SLA for 250 millisecond delivery times.\n\n": 1, 'Maybe this open source project is of use: https://github.com/dutchcoders/tradecollector.

For the digital ocean hosting, I don't have a bill to post yet.  I have been running at a reduced capacity for this month with only 1 AWS free tier instance in PDX, my home server, and one instance on Digital Ocean in Amsterdam.  But if I have clients dependent on the service I will up it to one host for each Digital Ocean Region (Singapore, Amsterdam, New York, and San Francisco)\n\nI can not be direct about the PubNub costs.  If you look at their [pricing](http://www.pubnub.com/pricing/) it depends on how many clients I need to support and the number of messages that I need to send.  I only had 27 unique IP's connect yesterday so I think it might be safe to say that their $50 per month tier to support 3,000 clients will be good enough.  Before this I haven't had the need to publish the data because I already had it within my back-end service so I won't be able to get an idea for the message costs until after this month (they don't have an estimated preview bill).  Message costs are $1 per one million messages.  With market depth data I will be publishing about 2 million messages per day.

Beef up the API a bit and I would pay more still (e.g. Add a supplemental service which can be polled to get an initial snapshot of all book data, only send messages when the depth has actually changed (not sure if you are doing this already,) provide a means to subscribe to only one denominating currency on ANX since their books are unified anyway, add the missing crypto-to-crypto on VoS (they _appear_ to be missing, at least, based on your polling stats doc elsewhere in the thread,) etc.)\n\nThough it might sound funny, I can think of no better way to say the following completely serious thing: this seems very relevant to my interests.

The issues list looks pretty good at the moment. Just a few notes off the top of my head while I\'m here (though I will probably resurface over on the github side after this thread has chilled for a while. I am still considering how much I might wish to connect, or avoid connecting, the two usernames.)\n\nRe #4 - I suspect that only ANX would really benefit from the "sub-channel" approach, unless there are other exchanges doing the same kind of book handling, so I wouldn\'t worry about going too crazy setting that up for other exchanges unless you had a particular hankering to do so. A generalized model in case it was needed later wouldn\'t hurt, of course.\n\nRe #3 - Might be worth splitting that issue in two to separate out the snapshot query from the only-on-change issue. As for the publishing of depth only upon change, I wouldn\'t mind if you sent data all the time, and can definitely understand the reasoning, but the cost and network traffic savings would be nice too and the change detection can easily enough be implemented on the client side. Long since already has been. :)\n\nRe #1 - Might be easiest to match the size of the upstream exchanges\' published book data, but it is certainly your call.\n\nOn a note related to the book size of #1 and the only publishing upon change of #3, I wonder if, given a snapshot query whose response includes sufficient timestamp / sequence / version / whatever kind of information, one could publish all the depth there is from each exchange, save bandwidth, etc. all in combination by going beyond pushing the whole book on change (or all the time) and instead push out a message containing all of the deltas in the subscribed book since last push. Plus this much quantity of ask at this price. Minus that much quantity of bid at that price. As many deltas are needed to describe the current set of changes. I suppose that in a very active market it could be double the size of just resending the whole book, since it would have to minus out all of the remove/eaten/etc. orders and then add in all of the new ones. Pros and cons, for certain, so perhaps just consider the above as some food for thought.\n\nAs one other cool possibility, not that anything would hinge on it, but... I would probably build a client for this by implementing an Xchange driver against your feed, preferably of the streaming variety. Having an official one might help with market uptake, but I\'m certain someone would probably be willing to share theirs.\n\nOn the cost topic, having just taken a fresh read through your apiary page, two thoughts come to mind: The first is that if that pricing is just for ticker data then the depth version is going to need to be built to send the minimum number of messages and amount of data as possible. The second is that you might want to look into other push providers. I have no relation to the following company, I just bumped into their products years back and they popped into my head just now, but perhaps the folks at Frozen Mountain might have something for you. Their hosted option is quoted at 15 cents per user per month, 100 user minimum, though I have absolutely no idea what limitations that might have.': 1, 'Thanks!

Currently, I query for the full order book with a rate limit of at most once every five seconds.  From there I trim the data down to 40 orders in total, 20 bids and 20 asks if possible.  This is only to reduce the messaging costs of PubNub, it could be increased if there is a desire for the full depth.  \n\nI've only written implementations for polling clients so I can't compare to the streaming API's.  Of the handful of clients I have implemented the biggest pain is handling the weird json serialization for each of them.  It makes it impossible to rely solely on a json deserialization library without writing custom deseriaizers.\n\nI didn't know that Bitstamp only updates their order book once a minute through their api.

It is an open source implementation of Pusher which is a similar service to PubNub.  I would just use Pusher directly but I would hit their message limits pretty quickly.  I have the pusher client publishing correctly already, so it is just a matter of standing up slanger on my hosts this weekend.

I am extremely excited that this might actually be useful for the community. And likewise on the clean data people.\n\nAre you currently collecting order book data?\n\nYes, I am just not publishing it to PubNub to reduce costs until there is enough evidence that the operating costs can be covered by donations.  The flag to publish can propagate to all hosts in less than 5 minutes (Props are cached for 5 minutes).  \n\n\nWhat are your goals with this site? Is it simply to provide an api data feed?\n\nI just want to provide the data feed for tickers, market depth, and public trades.  I would prefer to keep it open and running solely off of donations, but I might end up having to switch to a subscription model attempt because this is such a niche service.\n\nDo you have anything in particular that you want to investigate with this data?\n\nThe other project that started this is to find the optimal arbitrage paths through a graph with nodes as trades on an exchange and edges weighted with transfer costs and time (could be 0 if it just trades again on a different market on the same exchange).  Using Apache Storm was a perfect fit and made it easy to set up the simulation.  But it is a pain   to automate the re-balancing of funds because of the lack of transfer/withdraw api options from most exchanges.  So I decided to take a break from it and work on something that felt more productive.\n\nWhat are your current costs and what would they be if you expanded the content?\n\nExpanding content would not cost anything other than development time.  Scaling to handle several clients through PubNub will be costly though http://www.pubnub.com/pricing/.  I think having the massive amount of sdk clients and documentation available through PubNub makes it worth the costs.\n\nDigital Ocean VPS Hosting is $20 for 4 hosts.  I'm using a couple of the $10 promos right now though :)  The only reason to add more hosts would be to add redundancy to each geographical region.  But because there is no need to sample data faster than once every couple of seconds it is perfectly fine to temporarily query from New York to BTCE while the original node in Amsterdam is brought back up.  Nodes are considered dead if they do not check in after a configurable two minutes.  So that would be the worst case of downtime due to hardware failures.  If there is ever a need to ramp up frequency against an exchange then hosts would need to be added to get around rate limits imposed by the exchange.  I also have a node running on a aws free tier instance that will expire after a year.  For that I would just put up another Digital Ocean node if needed.\n\nI'm on track for ~$30 this month for other  AWS costs.

This is indicated by the grey box on the chart.  The price exceeded the first objective easily.  It approached the second objective and is only one box away from it.

This is actually a good thing as long as the decline does not continue below the formation.  For example, if the price were to drop back to the $445 box, it would mean this is not a new formation-but a continuation of the current formation.  That would indicate that the bulls do not have quite enough behind them to create another formation.  \n\nA retreat to $450 and another reversal back up would mean the start of a new formation.

But to try and claim that there is some sort of "textbook" that will give a definition of why economics is not worthy of scientific scrutiny, and that this sub exemplifies such a definition, is so abhorrently ignorant it makes me doubt that you know what you are trying to argue. There are several great minds from the past ~300 years that have commented on, and help develop, the economy we live in who deserve a bit more credit than "pulling it out of their ass". You know that bitcoin is built upon (among other things) basic economic principals of supply and demand?\n\nBut perhaps you have simply chosen the wrong word. It wasn\'t economics, it was the entirely different discipline of  market data interpretation that meant to deride? Why do I feel like this is the one and only place you have experienced "technical analysis"? Do you really expect to see quality content here? On reddit? \n\nThe worst thing that happened to this sub was BitcoinWisdom adding their tools to their charts. Now every cunt can draw some lines and they\'ve found the magic formula. Nobody is willing to go beyond the superficial shapes and lines and actually see what real traders do. So we get some fresh faced idiot making an oversimplified chart, with a y= ax + b line that tells is the price is going somewhere. The people like it, because the people can understand it. The traders know that it is foolish to base ideas off such little information, but being in the minority, their votes are lost. This is democracy manifest; if matters become too complicated, the masses do not want to know about it.\n\nAnd this is what this sub has become overwhelmed with: oversimplified drivel that is easy to understand, but is meaningless (because there is nothing to understand!). Well, the hens come home to roost and everyone realises that these lines don\'t lead to anything. What then? The folks get unsettled and start saying "TA is bullshit" ... "only news matters in markets" ... "TA doesn\'t apply to bitcoin like it does to stocks, even though I have never seen how TA applies to stocks". Hell, It might even go so far that the entire study of economics becomes bullshit! I don\'t blame the guys, but the thing is they probably haven\'t ever seen any real TA, or ever had an insight into the philosophy of a trader.\n\nI know this isn\'t new here, but I feel that the attempt to make judgement on the price action has become almost criminal.

They obviously have a few more things up their sleeves.  My guess would be that they are waiting for the price to rise a little more before they announce the next set of restrictions or sanctions.\n\nIt seems that the current thinking is to limit access to some sites through their firewall.  I found out recently that it is actually legal to bypass firewall restrictions, because the firewall "doesn\'t actually exist" in China.\n\n\n2.\n---\nHow long will it be before China needs to reverse its decision?  As bitcoin usage becomes more and more widespread for legitimate uses, and most Internet sites accept bitcoins, the Chinese are going to be at a huge disadvantage if they can\'t sell their goods and services for bitcoins.  As adoption continues to occur, the Chinese will become more and more of a closed off society.  They will have to change face at some point.\n\nAt what point will that be?  I\'d propose three bubbles from now, or about 18 months, although it will be very difficult to ignore bitcoins very soon.\n\n\n3.\n---\nI\'m surprised that Bobby Lee doesn\'t decide one of these days to just pack it in, move to the United States, and reopen shop.  His zero-fee model was doing a fine business in China, and he has more than $5m of venture capital to buy licenses and pay lawyers.  There aren\'t any competitors for him to compete against with a similar model in the US.\n\nIf his main goal with his fee structure was to promote the adoption of bitcoins, then he did too good a job of it.  He should stop pounding his head against the wall and move to some other country, where the same fee structure would cause explosive growth in a market much more friendly to him.\n\nI would argue that a big hindrance to bitcoins is Coinbase\'s high fees.  If someone opens a zero-fee exchange, then why not use bitcoins for purchases online instead of PayPal?  \n\n\n4.\n---\nSome people say that Circle\'s proposed service is great, but I\'ll believe it when I see it.  All they have is some fancy video on their site.  Lots of people have applied, but nobody has been able to provide any evidence at all that they have received invitations.\n\nWhen Circle is available to everyone to sign up, then I\'ll call that a groundbreaking achievement.  Until then, this is another service with a flashy website and great publicity, but nothing underneath that people can actually use.\n\n\n5.\n---\nSpeaking of great publicity, one of the things my co-worker noticed is how these altcoins have such great looking websites that are far out of proportion to what the coins actually provide.

I think you fail to understand what I said: As long as people can easily buy and sell ANY altcoin , use them to buy whatever they want, there is nothing unique about bitcoin. \nSure, right now there are more places where bitcoin is trader over dogecoin (or other alts) but consider that bitcoin was the first one, doge is 6 months old....and is already as popular as bitcoin in some cases , which is 5/6 years old? \nTo your second point: bitcoin is limited in supply. So what? There are at least 200+ alts that are also limited in supply, none of which matters to my argument.  If you can easily buy and sell any crypto, use it to purchase what you want with low fees, then there is nothing bitcoin has over any altcoin. Again, Bitcoins are no longer unique.': 2, 'I will say this again: We can\'t compare bitcoin\'s past to its present, bitcoin had some awesome gains last year, but bitcoin was UNIQUE. Btc is no longer unique, there are many altcoins (some are even more used as a currency than btc..) with better and more attractive feautures. \nThis is not a popular opinion, but it is the truth and that sometimes hurts. \nI honestly don\'t see a future where "bitcoin is widely adopted" or "mainstream", if anything cryptos in general will go mainstream, but not just bitcoin. Many original investors and traders, including myself, realized this some time ago. \nAnother point which you will hate:\nThe easier it gets to buy/sell bitcoins , the less the price will be. Why? \nBecause people will just quickly buy bitcoins, use them for what they are useful (low fees) , buy whatever they want and then a the merchant will sell them back to fiat. I said this a million times, bitcoin is waaaay too overpriced, I can do the exact same thing with dogecoins and the market cap is not even near btc\'s. \nWhat we have now is a market that is understanding that very simple thing: bitcoin was in a big bubble and right now it is overpriced. People have discovered other cryptos, that do the exact same thing and are A LOT cheaper. So there is a huge amount of people holding and waiting for new buyers(pump) to eventually sell (dump) their coins and cut loses, even up or even make some profit. New buyers are getting fucked everytime they join the market, as those waiting to dump do it as soon as there is a little pump in price. This is where we are at.\nAlso one more thing: If you own 10k USD worth of bitcoin and it goes "to the moon" you are looking at a "decent profit" , if you own 10k USD worth of dogecoin (or any other top10 alt) and it goes "to the moon" you are looking at being a millionaire. Sadly, I don\'t think any coin will go "to the moon" in price, considering there are so many now and the market is so spread. As long as you can buy them on exchanges its all people need.

Bitpay has set the way for merchants to easily accept Bitcoin without taking on any speculative risk on Bitcoin value.  It's also cheap / easy / quick to set up.\n\nThe next step is the consumer.  Why does the average consumer want to use Bitcoin to buy something?  In the past, buying Bitcoins had to be done via international wires, and would hit all kinds of fees.  Today it's easier, especially with Coinbase / Chinese exchanges.\n\nIf Circle's product launches as described, the whole thing becomes revolutionized.  People can buy BTC with a credit / debit card and have the Bitcoin ready to spend in minutes.  On top of that, there's no fees.

The idea of bitcoins and cryptos in general is to allow people to do transactions without a middleman, avoiding high fees. Guess what boy? You can already do this with altcoins.

Simple as that, I can\'t make it any easier for your deluded mind to understand it, but I will try with an example: Amagimetals.com  You want to buy gold or silver? Ok go there, they accept bitcoins and guess what else? Ripple, dogecoins, litecoins. I bought silver just 2 weeks ago using dogecoins. Now please tell me how that "didn\'t work" as a payment system.

Previous changes to the lower boundary were not changes to the model. The model maintained an unchanging definition for the last 6 weeks or so, with the lower boundary being defined as the line segment on the log chart that connects the troughs on either side of the bubble. History indicated that we should expect the December bubble to not be finished for a couple more weeks, which means that the lower boundary of the December bubble would continue to adjust downward until that time. Any observer who understood this properly would have taken the bubble lines as indicating the highest reasonable bubble given the price history, and would anticipate that the bubble forecast would go down over time. (Until the start of the green "goin\' up" phase.) For example, here is an example of a forecast chart that I made 2 months ago:\n\n     http://imgur.com/TkZx4Mv from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1z3m1z/a_look_at_four_bubbles_pricelog_linear_fit/) post \n\n     And here is another:\n\n     http://imgur.com/OJnxL5u from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1z727t/all_the_bubbles/) post \n\n     These were my "predictive" charts. Note how very similar they are to the current bubble watch charts. Everyone who studied the bubble watch chart carefully realized that it was going to tighten up with a downward bias over time, due to it\'s definition.\n\n2. Forecasting the lower boundary for the Summer 2014 bubble was previously done based on the average between the April and December bubbles. I have decided to incorporate more historical data by sticking to the long term trend line. We do not have any price data for the Summer 2014 bubble yet, because the December 2013 bubble has not finished, as defined by this analysis. So it would not be unreasonable to say that I am changing the Summer 2014 lower boundary definition prior to seeing any actual data in the period being projected. It seems a little premature to accuse me of having a rubber model if I am modifying the model prior to seeing any data!\n\n3. You are implying that I am in danger of reaching for exotic functions to map the data ever closer. I am merely switching from an average of the last two data points, to a constant exponential trend defined by the whole price history.

The old calculation for the Summer 2014 bubble lower boundary was just the average between the April bubble and the December bubble.

At which time we will revise our methods accordingly. From here on we will be employing a \xe2\x80\x9cRecharge Code\xe2\x80\x9d method, this method may be used with every major bank. OKCoin is doing everything in our power to ensure that our users\xe2\x80\x99 ability to recharge their accounts will continue uninhibited.\n\n>As not to affect the normal market prices, for the time being, revisions to our site\xe2\x80\x99s recharging methods will not be published again. Users who have only used our previous system please log in to OKCoin and try out our new method. If you run into any issues while recharging your account please contact OKCoin 24/7 at our Customer Service Hotline: 400-660-9037\n\n>How the recharge codes work:\n\n>OKCoin\xe2\x80\x99s recharge codes are now online.\n\n>For the convenience of our customers\xe2\x80\x99 withdrawals and deposits OKCoin has launched a recharge code service. Users can withdrawal money via a recharge code and then transfer the code to other OKCoin users who need to recharge. There is no fee to withdrawal via recharge codes. These codes can be circulated, recharged, and withdrawn freely among OKCoin users. A customer can also simply withdraw via a bank withdrawal as these remain unaffected.\n\n>OKCoin Recharge Code Explanation: The recharge code is separated into two parts, A and B(think private key and public key). Part A(public key) allows users to check validity as well as the amount belonging to the code. Part B(private code) is used for recharging. Only with both A and B can one successfully recharge their code. When one withdrawals using the recharge codes it uses the same A and B two part system. Please do not reveal your code\xe2\x80\x99s Part B(private key) to others.\n\n>Note: (1) A minimum of 100RMB and a maximum of 1,000,000RMB can be withdrawn with no fees. (2) OKCoin recharge codes require both part A and B to recharge. (3) Recharge codes may be used by ones self, or alternatively can be given to other OKCoin users to be used by them. (4). Part A is used to validate. After Part A has received an inquiry the code will be frozen for one(1) hour, during which time other users will not be able to inquire about the code. After an hour, it will return to normal. It is recommended that the buying and selling parties complete the transaction within the hour. Part B is used to recharge. After the buyer takes control of Part B, recharges will be frozen for an hour. After the seller confirms the transaction the code can be used to recharge the account. If the buyer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t confirm the transaction for 7 days, it will automatically be transferred to your account. (5) Please choose a reputable seller to buy recharge codes, disputes arising from transactions due to recharge codes must be resolved by the buyers and sellers of said codes, OKCoin is not responsible for resolving such disputes. (6) You can(and we suggest you do) choose to buy your recharge codes from an OKCoin certified dealer. Please charge the card first and then make the remittance.\n\n>So, an example of how this would work is below:\n\n>You would like to buy 1000 USD worth of BTC. You go to our webpage and find a verified seller(Account Management\xe2\x80\x94>Recharge RMB\xe2\x80\x94>OKCoin Recharge Code Dealers, scroll down for our verified sellers). You would contact him and tell him you would like to charge 1000 USD. He would then send you Part A(the public key) of the recharge code to validate the amount. This freezes the recharge code for the next hour as to keep the selling party from withdrawing the funds after you check. The selling party then sends you Part B(the private key) and then you send them the 1000 USD at which point they will confirm the transaction. You have now successfully purchased a recharge code with which you may recharge your code.\n\n>As to your other questions. No one knows. They could be stopped tomorrow, they could never be stopped, no one knows. Our initial recharge method was direct deposits into a personal, not business, account. That is no longer supported so we use the recharge codes. We'll see what happens. If you have any questions let me know.\n\nemphasis mine. How they could interpret the bank rulings as unclear is incredible.

It\'s not as if the instructions read something like "please censor articles with the following topics: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, bitcoins, J, K, L, N, O, and P."  Instead, they devote three sentences to bitcoins where all the other topics get a one-sentence mention.  They also say "please carry this out immediately."\n\nWe can now put to rest the idea that bitcoins are just another thing that the Chinese have to worry about, far behind other things.  They know exactly what bitcoins are, they recognize that they are a threat to them, they are taking all the actions they can, and they are out of options.\n\nAs freedom-loving individuals, we should be glad that this has happened.  The Chinese have removed themselves from one of the greatest technological innovations that has happened in many years.  We will make lots of money, and when bitcoins are worth $50k and the Chinese have no choice but to allow free trade, they will be transferring their wealth to us, setting their autocratic government back by a significant amount.\n\n\n2.\n---\nNot only that, but the markets failed to move whatsoever on this news, which would have been completely earth-shattering if released in January.  In January, such news would have probably caused a crash to $100 before a rebound.  Now, nobody cares.\n\nThe only constant is the bubble cycle.  As long as bitcoins survive, bubbles occur again and again.  News is irrelevant in the grand scheme of things.\n\n\n3.\n---\nSome people have criticized me when I talk about the future role of banks in bitcoins, so let me mention that.  As bitcoins continue to grow and become a popular method for transmitting money across the world, banks will also see the value in cutting out other banks from taking a share when they send money around the world.\n\nHowever, banks can improve their profits even more by mining bitcoins.  If they hold their own transactions until they find blocks, then they can make transfers to anyone for free - and they can even withhold transactions from other banks with whom they are competing.  Therefore, the future of mining lies in huge investment banks.  In several years, the miners aren\'t going to be rigs in people\'s basements; they will be either huge plants owned by banks, or hardware producers who have contracts with banks to produce a certain number of blocks per day.\n\nIn this scenario, the block rewards are not significant to the banks, because they want to control the timing and content of the transactions, so they will be willing to take a loss.  Non-bankers will not be incentivized to mine at a loss, so mining will become exclusively the domain of huge Wall Street firms.\n\nOther entities may also have an interest in controlling their own transactions.  The US government, for example, might decide to target one block per day to send enormous sums of money to creditors.  But since banks control most of the world\'s money, it is likely that banks will also control most of the world\'s mining.\n\n\n4.\n---\nIn addition to the bitcoin I purchased on Thursday, I bought another eight bitcoins yesterday.\n\nThis brings up an interesting point: you might ask how I can purchase so many bitcoins just by putting a paycheck aside.  I asked myself that as well, and the answer I came up with is that I don\'t do anything at the moment except work.  I work on weekdays, then drive home and work more - and on Saturdays and Sundays, I do work on the mining pool for 20 hours.\n\nSo it turns out that working "overtime" doesn\'t just pay off in extra salary (although in this case, I may earn nothing in the end), it also pays off because you have no use for money.  Over the past few months, my only credit card charges were (in order from most to least expensive) Federal taxes, rent, takeout, groceries, and transmission/oil/brake fluid/rust remover/gasoline to go back and forth to the office 5 miles per day.  There were no luxuries.\n\nSo you either work a lot but have no reason for so much money, or you work a little and don\'t have enough money to enjoy life.  Seems like a lose-lose situation.\n\n\nOther\n---\n**Days until July 24: 75**': 37, 'I had his comment saved but it seems to have mysteriously vanished.

If you've been attentive and looked at FXBTC's API price in the past days prior to May 10th, you'd have noticed that the rate dropped __from 2800 CNY to about 2300 CNY__ (users were extremely angry). I didn't check the API in the last three days, but about five days ago it was around 2300 CNY. It probably went even lower.\n\nWhat happened? Since deposits were halted and users were forced to withdraw by fiat or via BTC, buyers completely ruled the market and put their buys extremely low, around 2300 CNY. Users who didn't want to deal with other exchanges simply sold for a huge loss.\n\nNow, what I fear is, if all exchanges put an announcement in the near future which says: here's your last chance to withdraw, deposits have already been halted, banks won't allow withdraws after day XX/XX. The same thing will happen again.

I could give you everything I have but without experience and trial and error you would end up in the same place as if I hadn't helped you at all. Just start small and play around for a few weeks or months and you will start figuring things out. I can give you fish but you gotta learn how to catch them yourself. Good luck.": 1, "I've been trading in alts for a while now. \n\nA really good example of what you're talking about is what's happening with Darkcoin right now. You have this really cool technology with Masternodes, Darkcoin has X11 algorithm which has less mining overhead reduced heat so you have a lot of incentives more miners, essentially you have a really good coin with some actual innovation. But the market is still basically pumping and dumping it right now like any other shitty alt coin. \n\nSo you basically have two prices the market is trying to find, one is the price that reflects real world use cases and functionality of the coin and the market will find that after weeks or months of speculation, and if Masternodes actually start to drive the market value because people start using them a lot. Then you have the speculative price that is going to fluctuate a lot. Every little release and update by the dev team will be pumped and dumped, which will create a lot of volatility. \n\nI would argue that this volatility is what is holding almost every alt back right now. Even Bitcoin is struggling with this because of the constant China uncertainty. Earlier this year people were really intrigued at the prospect of making a huge profit, but at this point I think we can argue that people are starting to question that and that is holding the price down. \n\nIf these currencies remain so volatile then it's going to be really difficult to use them for their intended purpose. So really, I guess what I'm saying is that no matter how much you think a coin has some breakthrough technology and some really strong use case where you can see adoption picking up significantly in the coming months, you really don't know what the alt market is going to do. At this point I can say with confidence that is mostly driven by hype and irrationality. \n\nPeople act mostly based on what they think others are going to do, and even a lot of great coins with cool technologies just end up as fads alongside the other totally unoriginal coins simply due to speculators ruining the currency with extreme levels of volatility. \n\nRight now the only really safe way to make money in the alt market is to track certain established coins and watch for events that might drive the price down temporarily, and buy in a dip. Then you can be relatively assured that the price will rise. \n\nAlternatively you can follow the bitcointalk threads or hang out in the IRC of certain coins and try to buy minutes after a new feature that is going to be released is announced, and there will usually be a subsequent pump and dump. \n\nAlmost no coin right now stays up after a pump. Also with Bitcoin itself in a bear market right now the alt market is particularly dangerous to dabble in. Myself I am completely in fiat at the moment. I have learned to play it safe. If Bitcoin rises a little before I buy back in it's worth the peace of mind to know that I'm not going to get dumped on. I like to buy on a dip, or at least by when I know the prices is going to go up. Also I just have a strong intuition that we're in for another Bitcoin dump if for no other reason that people speculating that there will be a dump.\n\nLastly, of course you can make the most money of all investing a bitcoin or two in a brand new alt if you understand the community mentality and you think they will pump and dump the coin based on it's design, but this really requires a good intuition. I use Twitter a lot, read all the bitcointalk threads, and watch the exchange trollboxes on Poloniex or Cryptsy. \n\nIt really takes a lot of work to make good money. I've come really close to making a lot of money but have missed some key opportunities, sometimes by selling too soon, hesitating to make a buy, or sometimes by hesitating for mere minutes. \n\nIt is possible, but tough. For you though, someone who just wants to hold for weeks or months, I don't think there is any safe investment in alts right now. All you'd be doing is multiplying your risk. The only way to actually make money in alts is to be more engaged and be closer to a day/week trader.": 13, 'If you are interested in holding for weeks/months, I would just setup some very basic protocols on how you trade. Buy X amount of each coin over a certain market cap (or in the top 5/7/10/etc alts), hold for X time or until it gets to X value, then reevaluate. Add in a "If this awful scenario happens, dump immediately" set of rules, and you should have a decent HODL strategy. \n\nAt least that is probably what I would do.

Users can withdrawal money via a recharge code and then transfer the code to other OKCoin users who need to recharge. There is no fee to withdrawal via recharge codes. These codes can be circulated, recharged, and withdrawn freely among OKCoin users. A customer can also simply withdraw via a bank withdrawal as these remain unaffected. \n\nOKCoin Recharge Code Explanation: The recharge code is separated into two parts, A and B(think private key and public key). Part A(public key) allows users to check validity as well as the amount belonging to the code. Part B(private code) is used for recharging. Only with both A and B can one successfully recharge their code. When one withdrawals using the recharge codes it uses the same A and B two part system. Please do not reveal your code\xe2\x80\x99s Part B(private key) to others. \n\nNote: (1) A minimum of 100RMB and a maximum of 1,000,000RMB can be withdrawn with no fees. (2) OKCoin recharge codes require both part A and B to recharge. (3) Recharge codes may be used by ones self, or alternatively can be given to other OKCoin users to be used by them. (4). Part A is used to validate. After Part A has received an inquiry the code will be frozen for one(1) hour, during which time other users will not be able to inquire about the code. After an hour, it will return to normal. It is recommended that the buying and selling parties complete the transaction within the hour. Part B is used to recharge. After the buyer takes control of Part B, recharges will be frozen for an hour. After the seller confirms the transaction the code can be used to recharge the account. If the buyer doesn\xe2\x80\x99t confirm the transaction for 7 days, it will automatically be transferred to your account. (5) Please choose a reputable seller to buy recharge codes, disputes arising from transactions due to recharge codes must be resolved by the buyers and sellers of said codes, OKCoin is not responsible for resolving such disputes. (6) You can(and we suggest you do) choose to buy your recharge codes from an OKCoin certified dealer. Please charge the card first and then make the remittance. \n\n\nSo, an example of how this would work is below:\n\n\nYou would like to buy 1000 USD worth of BTC. You go to our webpage and find a verified seller(Account Management\xe2\x80\x94>Recharge RMB\xe2\x80\x94>OKCoin Recharge Code Dealers, scroll down for our verified sellers). You would contact him and tell him you would like to charge 1000 USD. He would then send you Part A(the public key) of the recharge code to validate the amount. This freezes the recharge code for the next hour as to keep the selling party from withdrawing the funds after you check. The selling party then sends you Part B(the private key) and then you send them the 1000 USD at which point they will confirm the transaction. You have now successfully purchased a recharge code with which you may recharge your code. \n\nAs to your other questions. No one knows. They could be stopped tomorrow, they could never be stopped, no one knows. Our initial recharge method was direct deposits into a personal, not business, account. That is no longer supported so we use the recharge codes. We'll see what happens. If you have any questions let me know. ": 28, "I'm not sure.

You could, if you wanted, set a limit buy in the exchange, which would be using your capital to buy LTC at a specified price. But as long as you are trading with your trading wallet on finex, you are borrowing funds. Therefore, any buying you do after short selling lessens the amount of coins you are shorting. They are exact contrary motions. I would recommend doing a lot of research with various available online resources [not reddit I mean] to inform yourself before diving into margin trading, especially if you are planning on using a 2.5x leverage option. The losses you can incur are enormous if you don't know what you are doing. ": 2, "Start with a small amount because it is INSANELY easy to lose your entire trading balance in a very short period of time. Even with tight stops in place, enough bad trades go by and your account dwindles down pretty fast. Plus, unless you live in China there is a good chance you are going to be asleep when most of the action happens.\n\nFrom the sounds of it, you have a lot of research to do.\n\nPersonally speaking I do better on margin trading when the price falls, and as a result I tend not to go long very often these days, if at all. I prefer to bet on price drops... being bear market and all. However, I've had a bunch of trades go sour by random pumps in the middle of the night (ie: last night) because I have a job and a family and can't stay up until 3am to watch charts. :p Shorting on bad news these days is insanely easy though. So whatever I lose on these little pumps I can make up for, and then some, when everybody panics and shits their pants.\n\nThe key is to keep tight stops so that you don't lose much while you are asleep. Or better yet, don't leave open trades when you can't babysit them. The problem is that due to the volatility, it may hit your stop on a short then go back down again. So you'll wake up thinking you made bank, only to realize you lost money.": 2, "Claiming a short is a Bitfinex specific feature and you don't need to wait for a 13% drop to claim a short. You can do it at any point. What claiming does is offsets your short position with wallet funds such that you avoid the buy commission. For example, let's say \\I have $4000 USD in my trading wallet and short 10 BTC at $450. Now let's say I want to close the position and I happen to have 10 BTC from another source. I transfer that 10 BTC into my bitfinex trading wallet and press claim. The short is closed removing the 10 BTC I just transferred in but avoiding the 0.1-0.2% commission on the buy order and the loss on the spread. The only fees you pay are the swap cost or borrowing cost.\n\nthe price can move up more than 13%. The requirement before your position is closed is that you have 13% excess margin available. So if the price is moving up and you are getting close to a call, you can always add more funds to avoid this situation.\n\nA limit buy will close that part of the short position. This is something that confused me at first also because in some brokerage accounts, a buy order is different than buy to cover and it is possible to have a long and a short position on the same asset in an account. This would be useful say if you had a good rate locked in on a swap and needed some BTC for whatever reason so needed to buy BTC for use without closing that swap by closing the short. Bitfinex doesn't allow you to do this or to create negative balances on one side of an account and offsetting them with another asset. Say withdrawing 1 BTC against $500 USD you have in the account, not gonna happen.": 5, 'I feel like simply telling you not to do it is like telling kids who are curious about condoms not have sex.\n\nI imagine if you have your heart set on it, you might just go and do it anyway, and you may as well be informed, and of course we all must start from somewhere.\n\nFirst of all, forget any assumptions or knowledge that you already have; from the questions you have asked, you seem to be misunderstanding quite a lot about how it works.\n\nhttp://bitfinex101.blogspot.co.uk/ This is a pretty basic introduction to using bitfinex, but you should also read around margin trading in general.

I don\'t know this number, any guesses? Millions of dollars a year right?\n* P value is $440, but started this year around $900, so P seems to be falling.\n* Q value is  some small number relative to M, somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.5 million bitcoins to be mined this year ...\n\nI just realized I don\'t have to know V, I can derive it by knowing M, P and Q.

On top of that, it's guaranteed that at least some of the coins being spent will be saved by some of the merchants, so that as more merchants accept btc, the more are taken out of circulation, which actually forces the price up. There will never be constant selling pressure because you will never see everyone constantly spending every coin. \n\nEdit: that said, I do think more merchants will mean less intense rallies/bubbles, and a more stable price overall, as the immediate conversions to fiat will act as a vent during rapid price increases.

The education level in India varies widely by caste, state, and language (I\'ll get back to this).  The problem is that the families that need and would benefit from remittance services are more likely to be poorly educated and economically poor (difficult to use MultiBit without a computer).  The language diversity is so large in the country that adoption is going to be slow and difficult due to their own language barriers talking to each other, there is also the regulatory risk from the individual states within India.  \n\nNow that said, areas that could be a boon to adoption that I know nothing about include the large domestic tech industry creating wealth and technical knowledge but I dont think there is large enough negative political sentiment to encourage early adoption like was the case in the United States.

They've had quite some time here to work on alternate plans.\n\nOne bullish scenario I can see happening is one or both of them moves operations out of the mainland, but they maintain the zero fee structure.  On the assumption that most of the money still left in the exchanges are diehards and/or sophisticated botting operations, they might opt to maintain their investment by buying into the relocated exchange, and the most frictionless form of transfer would be cashing RMB into BTC, driving the price up.\n\nAdditionally, from a long term perspective, mining contracts and localized direct sales become the method for buying into the offshore exchanges, with a small arbitrage opportunity for the supply side participants.  Chinese traders interested in making a new deposit first purchase a short-term mining contract, and after a day or two of that they can deposit freshly mined BTC into the offshore exchange and begin trading.\n\nWhen it comes time to cash out, take the BTC/USD back to the black market, or potentially even the miners who might use it to purchase more hashing power from manufacturers willing to accept BTC/USD as payment.  Under this scenario, a large miner might have their CapEx budget denominated in BTC/USD/RMB, but pay local expenses like electricity and also take profits in mostly RMB.  As you alluded to in your post, this would also open up a new revenue stream for mining operations in the form of arbitrage opportunities on both sides of the equation.\n\nI don't know what kind of capital controls exist around exchanging USD for RMB, because that's a capital inflow and China might be glad to have it.  If the friction is low, then cashing out might be especially easy.  Does anyone know?
