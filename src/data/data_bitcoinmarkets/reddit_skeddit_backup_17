If you are just looking to get long BTC, you can do that on a futures exchange with BTC as funding and get leverage if you want it.\n\nKeep in mind that when you leverage, you multiply your position but you also multiply your fees by the same amount. Even a low fee like 0.03% becomes quite a bit larger at 10x or 20x. \n\nMost exchanges don't charge recurring fees, with the exception of [BTC.sx](https://btc.sx), which charges 0.3% every 24 hours past the first 24 hrs, and of course [BitMEX](https://www.bitmex.com).

The other has a trade fee comparable to and often lower than BTC.sx, and no recurring fees.\n\nOn a futures exchange, if you have a strong sentiment that BTC will go long or short, you can really accelerate your earnings by using leverage.

Withdrawal delays are often the first manifestation of solvency issues. It would be great if somehow such delays could become publicly verifyable.

It would need cooperation of the bank that would have to publish the relevant verifyable data.\n\n": 1, ">The following events qualify as default:  \n>A publically announced hack, loss, or theft of customer Bitcoins.  \n>The publically announced closure of the exchange at a future date within 6 months.\n\nHow is that a default? That's a default only if it is followed by, well, default. If an exchange is hacked, but has sufficient reserves to cover the losses, there should be no payout. If for some reason it closes, for example owners decide it's not profitable enough, but pays everyone in full, there's definitely no default.  \n\nThis is not a default swap, this is some weird betting.  \n": 3, "Several thoughts...\n\nFirst, it seems to me that if it's an insurance product, the payout should be based on customer losses. If the hack results in a large enough loss that customers lose 10% of their deposits, it should pay out at 10%. That's the only structure I can see that makes it so I can use it as a quality hedge. Take the same approach you do with the futures contracts; if I want to hedge bitcoin exposure, the socialized losses aren't helpful, so you guys have (rightfully, imho) avoided them.\n\nSecond, this is going to behave a lot like a prediction market. One problem there is that when you require more collateral from one party than the other (1 BTC from the seller, only the sale price from the buyer), you'll tend to get biased prices if the market is illiquid, and more so if the price is showing a low probability of default.\n\nA potential solution to that is to offer the combination product: pays out if any of several exchanges are hacked. Unfortunately, I don't see a way to combine this with the linear payout scale I was advocating earlier in this comment. But if the main product is paying out as a binary prediction, and the combination product does too, then the combination product will have a higher price. That allows risk-seeking sellers to have a larger market impact with their money, and risk-averse arbitragers to (mostly) fix up the individual prices.": 1, 'Hey - Sam here from BitMEX.\n\nThat is the kind of feedback we\'re looking for in terms of the structure, and we are studying previous hacks and closures to determine a good threshold for this determination.\n\nThe payout could also be incremental. For example, one could imagine a payout structure:\n\n* Compromise of hot wallets / wallet rotation (e.g., the common, "please don\'t use old hot wallet addresses" indicative of private key loss or compromise): 10%\n* Loss of any customer funds, but covered by exchange funds (no loss to customers): 20%\n* Loss to customers of 10% or less: 50%\n* Loss over 10% to customers, up to total default: 100%\n\nIt could even be more incremental than that. The idea is to list a product that provides good and fair protection to buyers. The market will decide the price, but the better the protection, the higher the price and the better the interest rate sellers will earn. ': 1, 'That is a valid concern. A possible remedy is to have a grace period of a certain length to ensure that it is not a false announcement.': 1, 'Could increase the incentive for exchanges to "self-hack". Who would be brave enough to offer insurance on some of the exchanges out there? ': 2, "It's just an example structure to illustrate a point, not what we're going with. I agree with you on the concerns. As for paying out more than the actual loss, it's impossible to quantify what the actual loss to customers is. There may be significant opportunity cost, even if there is no actual loss of deposits. A structure that pays out opportunity cost, not just deposit loss, may have value to swap buyers.\n\nAs for exchanges announcing nonexistent hacks, this is a great example of why we would only list major exchanges. The reputation (and thus monetary) cost to an exchange must to be higher than the potential payout. If there were a flurry of buys before a suspicious event, not only would traders in the market notice it and start asking questions, but we would certainly launch our own investigation.": 1, "Yes, basically. Though I don't know enough about traditional swap nomenclature to know whether what I want is actually a swap, or something else.\n\nBasically, I'd like prediction-market style binary predictions. A contract that pays 1 to the buyer and 0 to the seller if exchange A defaults before a date (and 0 and 1 resp. otherwise), another for exchange B, another for C, etc. And then a combined contract that pays 1 if any of those default, 0 if none of those default.\n\nI suspect this will help risk-seeking sellers get better rates, and make use of arbitragers to shuffle those funds into the individual exchange contracts that the hedgers want.\n\n(You can also structure these as prediction market contracts requiring less collateral from the sellers, which matters if they trade at prices much less than 1. Market participants buy (or sell) pairs of YES/NO shares for 1 from the exchange, and then there's a market for the YES shares. If I want to sell to a bid at 0.1, I buy a pair, sell the YES, keep the NO. I'm now out only 0.9, which is the maximum amount I might owe and therefore full collateral, rather than what I think you're proposing where I need to put up 1 for the same operation. I think this only works well for the binary version, not the per-day rate version you were talking about, though.)": 1, "All looks OK. As a trader based in Canada I don't rely on any of these exchanges so I have no stake. But I will say that what you're offering seems to be both an insurance product but also a derivative people can speculate with. In terms of speculating, betting on whether exchanges will fail seems like something that would be in the interest of a hacker group? ie. buy up swap contracts, redirect DDOS botnet, collect premiums...I feel like what you're looking to set up is going to invite shenanigans.

Any time the legacy financial system faces turmoil it drives the price of hard assets such as gold up.

The BTC/EUR pairings actually have the greatest price gains with a 25.9% increase this month. As of today Bitcoin has gained 11% over the Euro, primarily due to its sharp decline in value.

Sudden price jumps that are only happening on that one exchange and not visible globally get punished though.\n\nDepending on backtests you probably will be able to tune X to an interval that makes it not too sensitive to smaller fluctuations but still points out issues not only 3 weeks later. Some tuning can include the way you calculate the "global" price, how to treat no-trade intervals (e.g. very small intervals or very few trades on smaller exchanges) or how to prevent cheating (e.g. by adding volume as weight or by factoring in slippage - calculate the amount of USD you\'d get after selling 10 BTC and do the calculations with this amount compared with 10 times the price at bitcoinaverage or something like that).': 3, 'That\'s true.

I haven't thought about considering shape though. Seems like for example how much is it jagged can be changed by a single bot. But yeah it's true that it is possible to distinguish bigger exchange from smaller just by looking at the shape without even knowing the axis. And it's hard for exchange to influence this (bots may, but one way or another somebody have to put money in the orderbook).

I'm wondering about that in relation to what these amounts (or function of them) should be. I'd like it to still work well in the future, independently of how much the market will change (so to be  super clear - e.g. if it turns out btc gets very expensive and is mostly hoarded or traded outside exchanges, then testing with amount that may seem reasonable now may not work i.e. will make it easy to cheat)\n\n": 1, "I have been thinking about this too.

In 1933 at the time we created the FDIC1 and again leading up to the Nixon Shock2. There are also examples from 19073 which indicated the beginning of the problem which extended back to the late-1800s.\n\nNo one is denying that sudden, dramatic deflation (or conversely, sudden inflation) hurts the economy. Of course it does. Whenever huge, unexpected changes to the monetary supply like this happen it is never good for the economy in the short-term. However, there was no spiral in either 1907 or 1933. People got hurt, yes, but the nation did not end. People did not starve or die = no spiral.\n\n>But you take away all economic velocity. What good does your gold do when it\'s sitting all in your bedroom. It means there is less gold in circulation which makes your gold more valuable. Same goes for bitcoin.\n\nNo, what actually happens is that people become more prudent with how they spend, and how they invest. You are right in that there is less of an incentive to spend when the currency will be more valuable next year. But that does not take away the incentive completely. Spending and investing have always been around and will always be around, they are a part of human nature. In fact, under a deflationary currency, only the most well-thought-out business plans, the most "worthy" start-ups, will get funding, because money is expensive. How is that a bad thing? As opposed to now where money is so cheap, every bank is lending to everybody and their mom for things they can\'t afford, the loans default and when it comes time to pay the bills the taxpayer is on the hook. To be clear, I am not advocating a 100% true deflationary currency for us right NOW. I am merely saying that the pendulum has swung too far the other way, and it wouldn\'t hurt to dial it back a bit.\n\n>How do we keep everything at 2% per year? Thats where the government steps in and subsidizes. Social the cost of those who hoard their investments and don\'t provide economic benefit.\n\nWho are you to say that those who "hoard" (i.e. save) don\'t provide economic benefit? This is a classic example of Keynesian disregard for the efficient mechanism that is the market. Let me explain what I mean: Suppose you have a hoarder (we\'ll call him a hoarder instead of a saver, since that is the term you prefer) who works all his life and never spends his savings (hoard? lol). What he essentially did was participate in a trade: others gave him money for his services because his service was more valuable to them than their money; conversely, he took the money for his work because the money was more valuable to him than his work. It was a mutually beneficial trade, and now let us assume (what would be in your opinion) the worst-case scenario: let us say that the hoarder dies with all his savings buried in the ground and lost forever. All that money he saved up permanently goes out of circulation. Now the question is, did the hoarder provide economic benefit? The answer is a resounding yes- he did so through his labor which was more valuable to others than the money that was lost. He essentially put his labor into the economy for what amounted to nothing! So even the most extreme "hoarder," by virtue of having earned his "hoard," provides economic benefit.\n\nYou want an examples of who really has no economic use? Prisoners. Welfare recipients. Mentally ill people who must be cared for by the state. Not savers (i.e. hoarders... lol)\n\nMy point is, you state that the government needs to step in and "socialize the cost of those who hoard..." That is simply wrong thinking. There is no "cost," and in fact, savers benefit the economy just as much as spenders.\n\n>Why do you deserve new money just because your parents became rich several centuries ago and now control 80% of the gold (which you don\'t use)?\n\nA) Ok, well why do the banks deserve the new money? B) It\'s not something that needs to be "deserved," it is simply a default position of sorts. In the scenario of a monetary inflation where everybody gets the new money and not just the banks, everybody\'s stake in the monetary supply remains unchanged, so no one is getting over on anybody else.\n\n>if we hadn\'t repealed glass-steagall we wouldn\'t be in this mess right now. but nevertheless we are here. the aftermath of bad mortgages packaged up as financial vehicles which lost their value. do we say LOL sorry and let america and the WORLD fall on their face?\n\nNo, what we do is we re-instate Glass-Steagall so it doesn\'t happen again. Did we do that? No. Are we going to do that? No. Have the rules changed since \'08? No! So will it happen again? YES. Ok, so what do we do? We abandon the existing financial system, because re-instating Glass-Steagall is never going to happen anyway.\n\nThe bottom line is the banks cannot continue to do what they are currently doing without repercussions. The Fed\'s balance sheet at the highest it\'s ever been (hmmm, I am curious to see how that will unwind: https://i.imgur.com/FUJSryv.jpg), exported inflation which will eventually come back to bite us in the ass. We are getting to a point where taking on more debt leads to only a miniscule improvement in the economy, all while a bloated state and an unchecked, undisciplined military simultaneously squanders what little wealth we truly generate.

I suspect this to be the case for most people.\n\nSeems a bit like a "Tragedy" of the Commons type situation; it is in everyone\'s best individual interest to hold deflationary currency, so whether or not it hurts their country\'s GDP or whatever, it makes more sense to go deflationary, if given the option.\n\nAm I making sense at all?': 4, 'EDIT: forget everything i wrote.  i do not need to analyze or reply to this comment\n\n>You want an examples of who really has no economic use?

We are monitoring that we are not printing out more than 2% in general.  Here is the problem with what you propose: anyone can print money.  Even in a "Deflationary" system.  If I take out a loan from you, 5 pence for your gold brick and agree to pay it back for 6 pence, I have to "come up with" 1 pence "out of the air".  Where does that come from?  You didn\'t print that extra pence and neither did I, but now it is due and after I pay it you will have an extra pence and I would need to have gotten it from somewhere.  Now your money supply is increasing (inflationary) or decreasing (deflationary).  \n\nHow do we keep everything at 2% per year?  Thats where the government steps in and subsidizes.  Social the cost of those who hoard their investments and don\'t provide economic benefit.  You may not like it, but hey some of us don\'t like the TSA or ACA but we\'re still forced to go through with it.  That\'s what happens in a democratically-elected government.  We accept what is the greater good for soceity as a whole.  We\'re not perfect, we adopt new ideas.

So the way we fixed the problem is we took a loan out against ourselves (QE) and we\'re going to pay it off.  Because the assets are now backed with value, anything invested in these assets will rise.  This meant all these millions of companies are going to see their asset values rise.  You can see just how largely everyone invested in MBS-assets and why it\'s almost a requirement that we, the people, stand behind the the promise of the full faith of the us government.  If we do not, we fail as a country.  So how do you manage this?

Responsible for credit derivative products at J.P. Morgan, **Masters became a managing director at 28, the youngest person to achieve that status in the firm\'s history.**[5] **She is widely credited with creating the modern credit default swap, a derivative used to manage credit exposure to underlying reference entities.**[6] In 1994, J.P. Morgan had extended a $4.8 billion credit line to Exxon, which faced the threat of $5 billion in punitive damages for the Exxon Valdez oil spill. A team of J.P. Morgan bankers led by Masters then purchased credit protection against the credit line to the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development to cut the capital which J.P. Morgan was required to hold against Exxon\'s default, thus reducing its own risk. J.P. Morgan later bundled together packages of such exposures and offered them to market as BISTRO, for Broad Index Secured Trust Offering, and these new financial instruments were quickly adopted by other banking institutions.[6]\n\n\n>When derivatives played a role in the 2008 financial crisis, having been applied by other firms to sub-prime mortgages, Gillian Tett\'s book, Fool\'s Gold: How the Bold Dreams of a Small Tribe at J.P. Morgan Was Corrupted by Wall Street Greed and Unleashed a Catastrophe, documented how the original intent and features of credit derivatives had been distorted.[7] Nonetheless, **Masters was described by the UK newspaper The Guardian as "the woman who invented financial weapons of mass destruction".** The paper later apologised for failing to give Masters an adequate opportunity to respond to their characterisation.[3] She had told the newspaper: "I do believe CDS [credit default swaps] have been miscast, much as poor workmen tend to blame their tools." She explained to The Economist, "Tools that transfer risk can also increase systemic risk if major counterparties fail to manage their exposures properly."[8] In April 2010 she told the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the European Parliament that "there are definitely lessons that have to be learnt. I for one feel that I have learnt from that experience and there are things I may like to have seen done differently". She stated support for reforms which increase transparency and reduce the risk of contagion among financial firms.[9]\n\n\n>**From 2001\xe2\x80\x932004, Masters served as the bank\'s head of Global Credit Portfolio and Credit Policy and Strategy. From 2004 to 2007, she was chief financial officer of J.P. Morgan\'s Investment Bank. In 2007 she was named head of Global Commodities.[10] By 2014, J.P.

GBTC shares are limited. If demand is higher than supply, the shares will trade at a premium (i.e. more than .1 BTC each)\n\n2. If you have 1 year old BTC holdings invested in BIT, you can sell your shares for a premium and then  instantly reinvest in BIT, gaining more shares representing more BTC.\n\n3. Wait one year. Repeat steps 1 and 2. Each year, you increase your bitcoin holdings. GBTC absorbs more and more bitcoin, reducing available supply of BTC, until the premium shrinks to zero. \n\nThis strategy will be implemented by many individual investors day by day so it will be a rolling process, sucking up more and more BTC. Its effect should be similar to the Willy bot. \n\nOnce the market recognizes that the supply is consistently being nibbled upon, traders will try to get in ahead of it. This should result in a gradual rise in bitcoin's price.\n\nWhy will demand be high enough to warrant a premium?\n\na) Only a limited number of BIT investors can sell at launch. Not all will sell. This will be the only way for retirement accounts, technology ETFs, etc. to gain exposure to bitcoin.  \nb) Pre-taxed money can enter GBTC, which is a very big incentive to invest in GBTC instead of holding bitcoin directly. That can save people millions in taxes if bitcoin is very high 20 years from now. \n\nHow does the Winklevoss ETF affect all this?\n\nThe Winklevoss ETF will interact with the market in real time. Shares won't be subject to GBTC's supply constraints, so there likely won't be as large of a premium if any.  The increase in supply may destroy GBTC's premium unless GBTC does something to compete (e.g. lowering fees). The Winklevoss ETF will not have a Willy bot effect, but rather it will be akin to an IPO. Everyone who wants bitcoin exposure at the spot price will be able to get it and COIN will have to immediately buy on the open market, thereby influencing the spot price.

If my overall dollar value is down but my btc holdings are higher I'm actually not bothered, while the smart person would have held dollars until they could tag the bottom and score the most btc per dollar, many many many of us jumped into btc just because it's fucking awesome and there's some community so being a part of it has some camaraderie in a way even though there's A LOT of crooked shit going on, this is still the Wild West and it's exciting so we all try to trade up btc holdings because we can't really imagine our lives any longer without btc.

Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg .\n\nWhile the competing Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is going through a lengthy Securities and Exchange Commission process to register a formal exchange-traded fund, the BIT has taken a backdoor route to public listing. By exploiting a rule that allows holders of a private fund to sell their shares publicly after a 12-month lockup period and completing a less arduous approval process with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, some of those long-held shares in BIT should soon be available to investors of any income or wealth bracket. The BIT is sponsored by Grayscale Investments, a unit of Mr. Silbert\xe2\x80\x99s Digital Currency Group, which he established last year to hold the digital currency interests of his broker-dealer SecondMarket Inc.\n\nThe creation of a publicly traded bitcoin investment vehicle is seen as an important milestone for the digital currency\xe2\x80\x99s bid for mainstream acceptance. Bitcoin advocates hope that regulated instruments will encourage a wider investment base as investors will no longer need to own bitcoin directly, which can expose them to hacking risks. Those same enthusiasts hope that more liquid trading will help smooth bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s notoriously volatile price and thus make the digital currency more appealing for online payments and value transfers.\n\nNeither Tyler nor Cameron Winklevoss was immediately available for comment. In the past they have argued that their offering will be superior to the Digital Currency Group\xe2\x80\x99s because investors will want the full imprimatur of the SEC before buying an ETF-like vehicle. Without SEC approval, Mr. Silbert\xe2\x80\x99s fund can\xe2\x80\x99t be formally classified as an ETF, but once existing shares are offered publicly it will function very much like one.\n\nAs of Sunday, BIT shares were being cited under the temporary ticker symbol BTCV on OTC Markets\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cpink sheets\xe2\x80\x9d site, which includes over-the-counter offerings from companies with limited information disclosure. Price quotes are being supplied by Merriman Capital, which has been given a 30-day exclusive status to function as the fund\xe2\x80\x99s initial market maker.\n\nMr. Silbert said Finra granted its request for a permanent ticker symbol, GBTC, and that \xe2\x80\x9cis expected to be effective shortly.\xe2\x80\x9d He said Grayscale is also separately \xe2\x80\x9cworking through the approval process to enable the BIT\xe2\x80\x99s shares to be quoted under the Alternative Reporting Standards on OTCQX, the top marketplace operated by OTC Markets Group.\xe2\x80\x9d That top-tier marketplace holds issuers to significantly higher standards of disclosure than is required for its pink sheet listings.\n\nIt is unclear how much secondary trading there will be in the BIT\xe2\x80\x99s publicly listed shares. Any new shares, which are generated whenever Grayscale purchases bitcoins, can be sold only to wealthy, accredited investors. The size of the secondary market float will depend on how many early investors take advantage of the expiry of the lockup period to sell.\n\nIn a statement, the Digital Currency Group said, \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough we have been assigned a ticker symbol, no assurances can be given as to when or if such trading will commence, or that an active public secondary market for BIT shares will develop or be maintained.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMany investors who purchased their shares at the BIT\xe2\x80\x99s launch in the fall of 2013, when bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s price was around $100, have an incentive to sell. Even though bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s price is well down from its peak around $1,150 in early December of that year, at the current $247 price quoted by news site Coindesk, those early investors have a chance to realize a healthy profit. The Digital Currency Group is also allowed to offer a limited amount of its proprietary shares to the public, which would encourage the development of the secondary market.\n\nEach share of BIT is worth approximately one-tenth of a bitcoin.

Before getting into some pointless war over this, let's discuss the difference between how data is displayed, and how it's interpreted.\n\n**Displaying data is objective.**\n\nLog scales show proportional changes in price in a linear way.  Halving the price (e.g. from 1000 to 500, or 10 to 5) will move the same distance along the Y-axis, regardless of price.  This means you can make direct comparisons at different points where you lost or gained a certain % of your money.  **Log-base 10 scales are no different than natural logs, or any other base.  The decimal system does not privilege certain ranges of data over others.**  The mathematics of logarithms simply make proportional changes appear linear.\n\nLinear scales show absolute changes in price.  A change in $100 is the same Y-axis distance no matter where you are.\n\n**Interpreting the data is *subjective*.**\n\nIn both cases, the way data is displayed will best match the question or issue being addressed.\n\nLog scales are generally very useful to traders because they're looking to increase their holdings of one asset or another.  In the case of bitcoin trading, it often doesn't matter if you're trading at $10 or $10,000; if the price doubles, your holdings double.  When looking at a chart, you're generally wanting to know what sorts of opportunities you've had / can predict to have to increase your holdings.  Market movements, as depicted on log scales, better reflect the interests of a trader attempting to maximize asset holdings.\n\nLinear scales are very useful for understanding how the overall market might be functioning relative to others.  For instance, we can look at a linear chart and get some idea of how the price behaves relative to other assets that might be exchanged.  Looking at volume gives an indication of the overall market activity.  Generally speaking, linear scales can be better for looking at fundamental market activity and relative trends.\n\n_____\nThere are perfectly good reasons for using either scale.  In the particular case of analyzing the long-term bear trend since Dec 2013, it's hard to say which one to use.  It really depends on your argument.  A trader might still prefer a log scale, as they're only interested in those proportional changes that can increase their holdings.  Others might want to engage in reasoning about why the price should be higher or lower relative to fundamentals.  In that case, the absolute price will directly affect the exchange of assets.  A $1000 bitcoin is ten times more difficult to acquire than a $100 bitcoin.\n\nWhat really needs to be cleared up, though, is this specious reasoning about orders of magnitude.  This is not mathematical thinking at all, and privileging the base-10 system is truly bizarre.": 20, ">It's common knowledge that Bitcoiners embrace log graphs because it downplays the dramatic fall in price.\n\nNot true. The reason log graphs are used is because the move from $1 to $100 has ten times the effect on the portfolio of any given Bitcoin investor than the move from $100 to $1000 does... but that's very difficult to discern from a linear chart.\n\nDespite this concept being very mathematically straightforward, you still seem to have difficulty understanding it.": 5, "Thanks for this very good clarifying post.\n\nHowever, I don't agree with this:\n\n>Linear scales are very useful for understanding how the overall market might be functioning relative to others.

All that matters is how the price moves for your USD profit, and that magnitude is most accurately represented log scale. If BTC goes from $1K to $2k, that's same USD profit as $100 to $200. Given the supply nature of BTC, it's easier for the price to move from $100 to $200, as $1K to $2k requires substantially more fiat onboard the BTC market.\n\nOn flipside, if one truly believes in the inevitability of the long-term bitcoin-takes-over-world-economy scenarios, then one would want to take profit in BTC w/ price going down. I'd argue linear doesn't matter as much either, because log scale shows magnitude increases in your BTC profits if you've shorted. Then the lower you've managed to short the price, the better, because then one could accumulate more profits in BTC the lower price goes.

An exchange cannot guarantee that there will be sufficient buys above 1700 to absorb the liquidation; if the position can only be fully liquidated at 1650, then, under the socialized loss system, socialized losses would be incurred at contract expiration. Under our new automatic counterparty deleveraging system, if there are insufficient buy orders at or above 1700, the system would automatically close part of the most-highly leveraged counterparty positions at 1700 (by automatically placing buy orders at 1700 equal to the amount that needs to be liquidated).\n\nSo you are correct, our new system "automatically modifies open positions of different users that aren\'t at risk of forced liquidation" if necessary to ensure that a forced liquidation order can be executed at the target price. The socialized loss system also "modifies" users\' positions, but it does so retroactively by taking back profits at contract expiration.\n\nUnder the socialized loss system, if you make a profit on Monday, then a 10% socialized loss event occurs on Friday, you would also have 10% of your profits taken back.

The price action of markets at selling and buying climaxes (crashes and rallies) is always the same, that's why these places on the chart look similar. There is always a climax in one direction (*that's what she said*) with an automatic reaction in the other direction, usually a secondary test follows on lower volume, then a ranging or consolidation period. These actions set the market up in terms of supply and demand which will define the next move. \n\nWhat happens next can be predicted by volume. More volume = more coins changing hands = more chance of a move from bear to bull market, or vice versa. The idea is that coins are *bought from* or *sold to* weak hands, depending on whether we're analyzing a selling or buying climax. Weak hands are simply those that allow themselves to get trapped into bad trading positions, usually from an excess of fear (fear of missing out on profit in a bull market, or fear of loss in a bear market). We call them The Herd, because when presented with danger or opportunity, they generally behave the same way: selling low and buying high. However, it takes low or high prices to lure them in the first place.\n\nWe had pretty high volume on the dip to $340. Everyone expected the market to rally at this point as we were breaking a long-term resistance line. We got a rally but it ultimately failed--still too much selling in the market.\n\nThe next sell climax was to $275 on even higher volume. Still no dice as Bitstamp got hacked which allowed further coinage to enter the market en masse, bringing us to where we are today...\n\n...sell climax to $160 on record volume. Now we begin to see the market acting more bullish as so many coins were pulled from weak hands, there is almost nothing left to sell. This is why I believe a crash to sub $200 is unlikely.

We hit a low spike all the way down to 166.45 then quickly climbed back up to a high of 315. I hope my math is right on this but that was an 89% rise in price. We then consolidated down to the 50% fib retractment and sit there poised to go either way in the next few weeks. \n\nNow to what has gone on before. On April 10th we hit a low at 340. The capitulation then is similar to our dive below 200 in speed and recovery. Then we climbed up to a high of 547. That was a nearly 61% price rise. Again we consolidated right to the 50% fib retractment line. After hovering there for a time we shot north in the fakeout bubble that took us to 685. \n\nA couple of observations. 1)Both down spikes crossed major resistance lines. April broke below the descending triangle and in January we broke below the descending channel we were in through 2014. 2)Both spikes had quick recoveries with over a 50% price increase. 3)The recovery is stronger this time. We broke an all time high in number of transactions and a huge number of coins were traded. By comparison the volume of the most recent drop was several orders of magnitude larger than in April. 4)Someone likes the 50's for resistance. The consolidation in April ended sitting a little below 450 and here again we sit a little below 250.\n\nIn April we saw a good price jump up to 685 that was borderline manic bubble. If something similar were to happen in the next few weeks we could test 350 I believe. This again would be hitting long term resistance. I would consider selling here if the market loses steam but I would be hesitant to sell too quickly. \n\nDisclaimer: I have no idea what I'm doing.

I think you should do that.\n\nCurrently, the fee for the e.g. BUU5 is 0.0003 BTC for 1 contract.  At the current price of 300 USD/BTC, that corresponds to 0.09 USD, or 0.9% of the contract size.  That is not a small fee; not exorbitant, but certainly not competitive.  If the BTC price suddenly rises to 3000 USD/BTC, then your fee would be 9%.  That would instantly kill you site.  If the price dropped to 30, it would be 0.09%.\n\nFor inspiration, the OKcoin fees are 0.03%, and only applied when you open the position, the fee when closing is 0.
