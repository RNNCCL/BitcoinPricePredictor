While a market stop loss will liquidate your position completely, albeit at perhaps a lower price than your trigger, the limit stop loss will guarantee you the trigger price, but for only as much as it can execute. If it cannot execute the full amount to be liquidated as the market moves beyond the trigger price, the order is cancelled and leaves a gaping hole in your account which will be emptied in its entirety if not caught immediately.\n\nWhy would a 0/low fee exchange present an advanced/extremely risky stop loss feature as a standard stop loss on highly leveraged trading and then go through the trouble to only provide this information buried in its disclosure statement?\n\nHow does one know that the contracts you are buying and selling on OKCoin are actually legitimate contracts with other traders, and that you are not actually playing against the House itself?\n\nThe answer is that you can't know these things because OKCoin is completely unregulated and their platform is completely non-transparent.\n\nIf it's the case that you are playing futures against OKCoin itself and not in a legitimate market, you can be sure that your stop losses will not completely execute from time to time and that the spot price of the futures will oscillate wildly taking out tight stops, both long and short.

This volume may not seem like much but it was done during a time when price action was stale and sideways. It turns out there was a full minute that passed before this registered on any other exchange. We hit a new floor at $360, which only lasted for a very brief period of time. This time around it was a western exchange that moved the markets.\n\nAgain, I would like to put emphasis on having multiple charts running simultaneously. If you are quick on the trigger and catch a big move like this, you can take the gamble out of your trades entirely. Trading in a free market can provide you with strategies and opportunity not available elsewhere. Unlike traditional models, you can really take advantage of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin. There is no one platform that acts as the supreme centralized hub of trading activity. It\xe2\x80\x99s the wild west with big gains and big risks.\n\nAs fun as trading in a free market can be, there are a few things to be cautious about. As many of you know, the Chinese exchanges are manipulating volume reporting through wash trading. This activity is illegal in traditional financial markets because it gives investors a false sense of the markets. They also have insanely high leverage on margin trading. So ask yourself if dumping a mere $264,920 worth of Bitcoins can make the price drop by $9, what\xe2\x80\x99s to stop an exchange from dumping their own coins to trigger a margin call? How do we know these exchanges aren\xe2\x80\x99t actively trading or manipulating the markets? Please don\xe2\x80\x99t construe this as an accusation or take it as fact. I\xe2\x80\x99m merely asking the question because anything is possible. Can large exchanges really sustain themselves on a zero fee trading platform? Something to think about.

The dump didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a severe effect on price but took us out of the 80\xe2\x80\x99s range. There is currently lots of resistance around $374. If the markets stay within its current range then it may be profitable to go long after a dump when that floor is hit. That said price action is bound to do a break out at some point and if price falls bellow $370 there may be some good shorting opportunities.\n\nExaggerated volume reporting put aside, the Chinese exchanges still seem to be market movers. It\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to note that they tend to be in the habit of dumping early morning when the western trading activity is fairly low. These dumps usually take several minutes before they register on the western platforms. As inconvenient as late night/ early morning trading may be for us, some of the best opportunities may be at this hour. There may be lots of unattended orders left on the books overnight, which could give late night traders an added edge. You will still have to contend with trading bots but you will have at least a minute or two to short when you see dumps happening on the other side of the world.\n\nFor developers, perhaps its possible to create a bot that will react quickly when major activity happens in China? A strategy like this would greatly reduce the gambling element out of your trades and potentially increase your win ratio. That said, because trading is a zero sum gain if most people do this, then that small window of opportunity may close.

In terms of volume of trading, it is by far the largest market in the world.  The main participants in this market are the larger international banks. [Financial centres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_centre) around the world function as anchors of trading between a wide range of multiple types of buyers and sellers around the clock, with the exception of weekends. The foreign exchange market determines the relative values of different currencies.  The foreign exchange market works through financial institutions, and it operates on several levels. Behind the scenes banks turn to a smaller number of financial firms known as \xe2\x80\x9cdealers,\xe2\x80\x9d who are actively involved in large quantities of foreign exchange trading. Most foreign exchange dealers are banks, so this behind-the-scenes market is sometimes called the \xe2\x80\x9cinterbank market\xe2\x80\x9d, although a few insurance companies and other kinds of financial firms are involved. Trades between foreign exchange dealers can be very large, involving hundreds of millions of dollars. Because of the sovereignty issue when involving two currencies, Forex has little (if any) supervisory entity regulating its actions. The foreign exchange market assists international trade and investments by enabling [currency conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_conversion). For example, it permits a business in the [United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States) to import goods from the [European Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Union) member states, especially [Eurozone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurozone) members, and pay [Euros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro), even though its income is in [United States dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_dollar). It also supports direct speculation and evaluation relative to the value of currencies, and the [carry trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry_trade), speculation based on the interest rate differential between two currencies.  In a typical foreign exchange transaction, a party purchases some quantity of one currency by paying for some quantity of another currency. The modern foreign exchange market began forming during the 1970s after three decades of government restrictions on foreign exchange transactions (the [Bretton Woods system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bretton_Woods_system) of monetary management established the rules for commercial and financial relations among the world's major industrial states after [World War II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II)), when countries gradually switched to [floating exchange rates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_exchange_rate) from the previous [exchange rate regime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_rate_regime), which remained [fixed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fixed_exchange_rate) as per the Bretton Woods system.

The amount coming into BTC due to upward speculation could continue to be lower than the amount leaving due to disaffected holders.\n\nThere was a graph on /r/Bitcoin showing that the vast majority of coins have been dormant for a long time (some combination of holding, and lost keys). My view is that at some point, before the speculative value of BTC plummets, there will need to be a large amount of activity in the area of buying BTC in order to use it, not to simply hold it. People don't hold dollars because they believe it will be more valuable in the future (it certainly won't...), but because they know they can easily use them for the exchange of goods and services. Merchants accept dollars because their customers wish to pay with dollars, and they can accept them without serious volatility risk*.\n\nSince actual economic activity is what gives currency value, speculative value is based mostly on expected future economic activity. If actual economic activity is shown not to be materializing, speculative value diminishes considerably. So, actual economic activity in BTC needs to keep growing at a good rate or it is entirely possible that the value of BTC will collapse, many Bitcoin services will fail, and merchants will stop accepting BTC.\n\nI do see some evidence that economic activity *is* growing, (clear uptrend in overall transaction growth, and a spike on 14th November, related to Chinese single's day 3 days before?), but at the same time I'm concerned that the statements BitPay have made make it seem that they could be doing no more volume now than they were in March of this year.\n\n\\* I realize there are ways to mitigate volatility risk, such as using BitPay, but they themselves may be highly exposed to volatility.": 5, "it's the joint hypothesis; either the market is correct or your model is wrong\n\n1. the market is off fundamentals (model is right): severe correction occurs\n\n2. the market is right, your model is wrong; most easily demonstrated by its regression slope decreasing\n\nUsually it's a mix of these two factors, then a decline of volatility over months during the price discovery process": 3, "Might have made a difference, don't be pessimistic :)": 0, 'Why are you so certain none of the speculated services or uses will come to fruit?': 1, "Yeah you're right the tipping service definitely needs to be done different.\n\nIf micropayments take off significantly enough for companies like apple to create their own micropayment services (how would that work btw?

Having a firm grasp on behavioral investing is the most important thing to have, in my opinion.  After that, then you can start focusing more on technical analysis, and a lot of the patters will make more logical sense because you can couple the TA patterns with the behavioral side of things that causes those specific patterns to occur.\n\nAfter that, I'd say you're ready to start dabbling in trading.

The truth is, it's a different kind of future, intended for a different kind of investor. Our target audience is commercial hedgers, miners, payment processors, and any other parties that have a need for serious derivatives products without surprises or clawbacks. BitMEX offers the only futures products on the market that can be used for hedging; every single one of our competitors has clawbacks, which make hedging impossible, or funding fees, which can bankrupt you in just a few weeks.\n\nWe bring over 40 years of combined finance experience to the table, a risk management system that works, a great API with realtime data, a secure multi-signature backend, and the assurance that your PNL won't be clobbered at the end of the month.

The Chinese exchanges like BitVC, 796, and OKCoin offer massive leverage and low fees. This makes sense for them - with every extra multiple they allow you to leverage, their fees increase. Unfortunately, so does volatility. \n\nMarkets with high leverage are extremely volatile. Compounding that, the Bitcoin spot market is extremely volatile as well. When users are leveraged 10x, a quick 10% movement without sufficient liquidity means a trader goes completely bankrupt. More movement than that, and the trader goes in the negative - and the exchange is holding the bag. Now imagine what happens with 20x leverage. \n\nUnfortunately, these exchanges don't take responsibility for the leverage they offer. When things go sour, rather than cover the losses they've incurred, they shift the losses onto their users. About 10 days ago, we saw the effect of that: a 46.1% profit clawback on BitVC. Charge low fees or zero fees all you want, an exchange can't make up for that kind of loss.\n\nFrom the point of view of these exchanges, this is a win-win. Charge fees that look low, lever them up to the sky, which creates high volume (and [multiply them by 2x for good measure](https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2ld9zs/you_might_have_noticed_okcoin_futures_volume/)), and when it comes crashing down, charge your users to cover the loss.

If it did not, you ask yourself if it reversed base on a specified amount.  If it did, you are in a new column.  Except you are going in the different direction.  if it did neither, you are done.\n\nThe simplicity allows you to develop patterns that tend to be right more often than not.

Even on a position held for the entire month, the overall insurance cost is less than many clawbacks, while providing assurance that your settlement will be as you expect.\n\nA favorable side effect of our no-clawback rule is that profits are realized at the end of every 8hr session, rather than at settlement. If you want to get out of your position, simply trade out with our low fee and withdraw.

First, we saw a quickly accelerating price increase over the last 12 months.  Over this past year, two important things have happened:\n\n1) widespread adoption of bitcoin by major mainstream retailers.\n2) difficulty of mining crossing the threshold where casual mining is no longer profitable\n\nThe confluence of these two factors is a very big deal, to me.  Widespread adoption is the factor most responsible for the recent price spike to over 1000.00 USD, but anyone looking at the following "crash" to the 3-400 USD range isn\'t looking at the big picture.  As I write, btc is valued at around 375.00, or about three times less than the highest bitcoin price we\'ve seen this year/ever.  But it is still seen over 250% in gains over the last 18 months, and over 2000% gains over the last 24 months.  The recent price dive to ~360.00 USD represents a reasonable current market value of bitcoin, and is probably the price floor of what we will see in the foreseeable future.  This price dive doesn\'t represent a crash, but the market evening out after a lot of early adopters and overexcited late investors cashed out following widespread public adoption.\n\nThe second factor here, or the threshold of casual mining profitability having been crossed, means that bitcoin has left the growing pains period.  At this point, the supply side of the value equation has slowed to a trickle, and the proliferation of bitcoin in the mainstream will likely at least meet and usually exceed the increasing supply for some time.

It is supposed to reveal changes in the strength, direction, [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum_(finance\\)), and duration of a trend in a stock\'s price.\n\n>The MACD indicator (or "oscillator") is a collection of three [time series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series) calculated from historical price data, most often the [closing price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_price). These three series are: the MACD series proper, the "signal" or "average" series, and the "divergence" series which is the difference between the two. The MACD series is the difference between a "fast" (short period) [exponential moving average (EMA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average_(finance\\)#Exponential_moving_average), and a "slow" (longer period) EMA of the price series. The average series is an EMA of the MACD series itself.\n\n>The MACD indicator thus depends on three time parameters, namely the time constants of the three EMAs. The notation "MACD(*a*,*b*,*c*)" usually denotes the indicator where the MACD series is the difference of EMAs with characteristic times *a* and *b*, and the average series is an EMA of the MACD series with characteristic time *c*. These parameters are usually measured in days. The most commonly used values are 12, 26, and 9 days, that is, MACD(12,26,9). As true with most of the technical indicators, MACD also finds its period settings from the old days when technical analysis used to be mainly based on the daily charts. The reason was the lack of the modern trading platforms which show the changing prices every moment. As the working week used to be 6-days, the period settings of (12, 26, 9) represent 2 weeks, 1 month and one and a half week.   Now when the trading weeks have only 5 days, possibilities of changing the period settings cannot be overruled. However, it is always better to stick to the period settings which are used by the majority of traders as the buying and selling decisions based on the standard settings further push the prices in that direction.\n\n>====\n\n>[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/nvjYdeF.gif) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MACDpicwiki.gif) - *Example of historical stock price data \\(top half\\) with the typical presentation of a MACD\\(12,26,9\\) indicator \\(bottom half\\).

If I want to take or close say a 500 BTC position, that will move the bitmex order book to a degree that I am better off using a bigger exchange. I can take a position at OkCoin with fairly little market movement and spread. Same with Finex though to a lesser degree.

": 2, 'Hey btctrader10, Sam here, CTO of BitMEX.\n\nThe difference here is in the type of contract that you are trading. The interesting fact about our XBT series is that instead of a USD multiplier, the multiplier is in XBT (XBT is the ticker we use for Bitcoin, by the way) so that your notional in XBT terms varies linearly with the movement in spot price, but in USD terms your notional changes in a non-linear fashion.  This is called a quanto derivative. From Wikipedia:\n\n> A quanto is a type of derivative in which the underlying is denominated in one currency, but the instrument itself is settled in another currency at some fixed rate.\n\nIn simpler terms, our XBT series contract has a fixed Bitcoin value at settlement: the USD price it settles at, times the multiplier in Satoshis. Assuming you are trading XBTZ14, when it settles on December 26, your account is credited its USD value (say 400) times 1000 Satoshis, or 0.004 Bitcoin per contract.\n\nIf you are long this contract and you aren\'t using leverage, it is impossible to be margin called when the price drops as the value of the underlying (Bitcoin) is also dropping. The capital you hold always covers the value of the contract.\n\nWhat is not clear to most users is that OKCoin et al trade **inverse futures**, that is, contracts where the value in fiat terms is fixed. The usual value of these contracts is USD$100. When you buy this type of contract at a price, say, "$400", it costs 0.25 Bitcoin per contract.\n\nYou can still be margin called when going long on this type of contract. Imagine you invest 1 Bitcoin and buy 4 inverse futures quoted at $400. Then, bearwhale approaches and the Bitcoin price falls through the floor. At $200, you will completely bankrupt. This is counterintuitive to many. Here\'s why:\n\nImagine buying 4 contracts as assuming a liability of $400. As the XBT price drops to $200, you still have a liability of $400, but that now costs 2 XBT, not 1, so your loss is 1 Bitcoin; that is, you have lost everything. The formula for this is simple: (4 \\* -100 / 200) - (4 \\* -100 / 400) = -1.\n\nGiven a maintenance margin requirement of 20%, you\'d be margin called around $240.  It\'s actually surprisingly unclear what OKCoin\'s maintenance margin requirement is - I can\'t find it anywhere on their website. $150 seems a bit early to be margin called if you deposited 2 XBT. At that point, your loss is 1.66 Bitcoin, meaning you still hold 33% of equity.\n\nI hope that helps. \n\nWe are launching an inverse chain (the XBU series) very soon. The specifications are very similar; each contract will be worth USD$100 in Bitcoin. We of course will continue to display the liquidation price very clearly next to each of your positions.
