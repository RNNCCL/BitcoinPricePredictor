Or whatever works.\n\nAlso one thing I failed to explain properly last night was this: Currently if you post something on the daily in the few hours before that thread goes "obsolete" due to there being a new daily, then not a lot of people will read it. So it\'s kind of a wasted effort. This would solve that to a certain extent, in that your post will always stay on the top thread for 24 hours (or 12 hours, etc.)\n\nYes, I have no idea how this would be implemented, but I don\'t see any logical impediments to doing so.': 2, "> reddit can't do what you suggest.\n\nReddit could change?

Take it for what it's worth.": 0, 'Well, first, I have no idea how we would implement the idea you\'ve put forth above.  But beyond that, would that actually solve anything?  What you\'ve described sounds like we would still have a daily discussion thread, but we\'d also have a separate "24 hour thread" which would be constant and never go away?  And the comments from the constant 24 hour thread would automatically go into the corresponding Daily Discussion thread and remain there forever, but they\'d be pulled from the "24 hour thread" after 24 hours?  \n\nYeah, I don\'t know how we\'d implement something like that, and I also don\'t think you\'re solving the problem of the daily discussion feeling stale.  Your "last 24 hours" post would ALWAYS have 24 hours worth of comments and activity within it, even if the comments were vapid and useless.

I would think if there was a 50% bull, and 50% short there would be equilibrium at the index.  But what you're saying is that the high leverage isn't the primary drive but its the interest rates.  It's because of the natural disparity in them.\n\nBulls will trade more on futures because of lower interest.  Bears will trade on spot until there's a premium?

It fires (immediately) when the difference in price between the most recent transaction and that of the last alerted transaction exceeds a user configurable threshold. For sake of completeness: when you first setup a price delta no "last alerted transaction" exists, so the last transaction at the time you set it up is used instead.\n\nIf you set the delta to 2, and the price rises from 240 to 244 and goes down to 240 again, then you\'ll get an alert at 242, 244, 242 and 240.\n\nYou can use it to actively keep track of the price. In constrast to candle based indicators, there is no lag as it immediately fires at the time the transaction occurs.

My link starts off by noting that commodities sometimes function as currencies.  And yes, tuna fish, under very specific circumstances can function as both a currency and/or a commodity.  But the purpose of words is to distinguish.  To say that all assets are currencies because under some very specific circumstance it may function as such is just silly.  Trying to define a word to include all things simply destroys the word, which is why language doesn\'t work that way, and why currency and commodity do have different definitions and are used differently.  These two words provide sometimes subtle, but often important distinguishing characteristics.  Here\'s an example of why the distinction is useful: in contrasting gold with bitcoin, we can note that bitcoin can potentially contribute more value as a currency than physical gold.  Physical gold can\'t easily be transferred across continents, and physical gold can\'t be transferred instantly.  Bitcoin can do both these things, which makes it potentially more attractive as a currency.  Then we can separately discuss the commodity characteristics of each.  Physical gold can\'t be hacked, but it can be stolen.  It\'s totally anonymous, unlike bitcoin with is pseudo-anonymous etc.  It\'s great that we have two words that mean different things because it makes discussions like this easier.\n\nYour whole argument is like saying, "because men are sometimes brothers, the words "men" and "brothers" are identical."

Why not?", 21): {'Paging /u/prof7bit': 1, 'The assumption Shannon made was one of a true random walk on a grid; not only are you as likely to win or to lose, you have some other properties like memorylessness to your advantage. Not just that, the chances that a losing streak is going to reverse and the price is "going back up eventually" is 100%.\n\n Markets don\'t work like that. Think of a decaying price that drops by 10% like clockwork every three days. Shannon says, every three days, you should rebalance, meaning converting 10% more of your cash into bitcoin.\n\nWhat happens if the price never stops dropping? Each step of progress, you lose a little net asset value, and while in the end you end up with all the bitcoin available on the market, your net asset value drops to zero quickly because you own a bunch of worthless crap.\n\nNow consider the opposite, with an upward trend. Then you are constantly selling little portions of bitcoin and when the price hits the moon you have fractions of the profit you could have had by holding even a little longer between sells, and almost no bitcoin left.\n\nShannon\'s method would work well when two commodities are in a channel and are slowly randomly walking up and down, for example with a EUR/USD pairing. Perhaps quarterly, rebalance a EUR/USD portfolio, for example. But in volatile markets... Well, shannon seems to be my knee jerk behavior in times of panic, admittedly. "20% price drop, huh? I should buy back in!" Or "yeesh, the price went up a bit, I should start getting out."

So after a losing streak, you still reference to your initial point, and then you come to the false conclusion that you\'d somehow gravitate towards the initial value.\n\nEven after a losing streak, the odds of the price going down or up remain equal at 50%. You don\'t have a 100% expectation of recovering from the losing streak.

Because the hashing power has historically overperformed, the average block time is closer to 8 minutes than the ideal 10, so the average coins per day is closer to 4,000 than 3,600. \n\n3. This [hashrate trend](https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty) has changed in the past six months. It's stopped increasing and gone flat. This indicates that miners no longer have additional money to invest and the price of coins today is very close to the actual cost to mine them.

I have experience trading, swing and day-trading stocks, options, and futures.\n\nOK, after that brief introduction, here is what I am seeing.  I would really appreciate feedback from others who may have followed this historically.\n\nI have really been watching the on balance volume (obv) over the past few days with both the exchanges and the futures on OKCoin.  There are bullish divergences on the exchanges (the obv goes up more than btc or is fairly flat on the big dips).  On the futures, especially the short term one which has the most volume, the obv tracks closer to btc price.\n\nBasically, what it looks like to me is that the big dips come from huge dumps onto the futures market.  This is the place where you can have the most price impact using leverage for the least money.  Money is actually coming in (hitting the ask more than the bid) on pretty much every exchange.\n\nIn my mind, eventually the real money coming into the currency itself, if that continues, will win over the futures manipulation.  I say manipulation, because it really seems to be that.  If you are trying to get the most for a sale, you probably don't just dump like that.  If trying to cover or improve the position of a large short holding (or if trying to accumulate), then it makes sense and is very effective.\n\nIt is effective, until the sentiment of the market overall becomes too strong.  I mean, you can work a market which is trending down to go down faster or slower, but if the trend reverses, you can only do so much really.\n\nSo my question is, can anyone speak to the obv historically as an indicator?

You _cannot_ properly backtest any algorithm that trades as much as yours using tick data only. In live trading you never get a fill at last traded price.

It's going to be a very crude approximation though.\n\nYou are trading BTC/CNY on OKCoin.cn, right? According to my simple tests, the slippage for 1BTC market orders would be at least 0.5 CNY on average. Backtesting tools usually have configurable slippage settings that are used when estimating fill price based on tick data. The best way to backtest is to simulate order execution against the order book using real order book history.

Even when live trading, the order price is only based on the price of the last few trades.\n\nFirst of all, you will be able to tell if your limit order was executed right away when it arrived on the exchange. If the bids/asks changed by the time your order arrived, and now your limit order can be matched to the bid/ask on the book, your order will be executed right away similar to a market order.\n\nSecond, you will be able to tell if the buy/sell order that you deconstructed using trade history cleared enough orderbook to hit your limit order. You don't have the actual order stream, you just have executed trades. One market sell/buy order results in several executed trades as it goes through the orderbook. Your goal is to try and calculate what would happen if your limit order was sitting on the orderbook. In most cases if there was a large enough trade below/above your limit order, your limit order would be hit as well. But sometimes you are a bit too late or too early with your limit order. Order book data helps because it has millisecond precision (at least for OKCoin) and you can see what's going on.\n\nIn any case perfect simulation/backtesting is impossible even if your volume is too low to affect other market participants. I would recommend adding slippage even for limit orders to account for a fact that backtesting almost always shows better results than live trading. 0.5 CNY is too much if you are using limit orders but something in the range of 0.1 CNY should get you closer to live results.\n\nHope that helps ;-)": 1, "As has already been observed, the problem is that your actions have an effect/influence on the market.\n\nI'm curious: have you backtested against the timeframe *in which you were trading*? In other words, did you try trading over a particular period, and then backtesting the same strategy over that period, to compare the results of the backtest versus the results of reality? \n\nThis seems like the best approach in terms of determining what is causing the discrepancy.": 2, "You get buy/sell trade type from the OKCoin REST API. I would try to incorporate trade type as another variable in your model, it might increase its predictive power.\n\nYes, testing live is a pain but you can make it easier. Our trading system can trade multiple algorithms/strategies using a single exchange account. It has its own position tracking, p&l calculations, order logging, trade history etc. that work independent of the exchange. Makes it much easier to test multiple algorithms or multiple instances of the same algorithm with different parameters. It also allows to quickly re-allocate capital between different algorithms without actually moving money between accounts. We are planning to open-source it at some point but I'm not sure when/if it's going to happen.\n\nYes, market-maker type algorithms have very low profit per trade but it's usually not the case with predictive strategies. In my experience such small edge during backtesting could be a backtesting artifact and can disappear completely and turn into loss when trading live. If you get consistent profit trading live it's a different case. But you have to test live for extended period of time, like 30 days or more, to make sure that it's not random variations and you found an edge that your algorithm can exploit in different market conditions.\n\nAs I said before, slippage for limit orders is zero, they always execute at the price you specified. Slippage for market orders can be quite substantial for larger amounts. I suggested that you can use small slippage for limit orders during backtesting to account for factors that your backtesting algorithm cannot model properly. It's up to you of course. In my experience most backtests are better than live results and adding small slippage might help.": 1, "When you do backtesting, you are assuming that the market condition in the future is similar to it in the past. So basically, your loss is because the market condition has changed. \n\nThe most important thing is to update your trading system constantly. I have been trading in the highly competitive FX market for many years. Although my trading system has made considerable amount of profit, it is far from consistent. The market condition is always changing every few months, so I need to constantly tune parameters or change rules every few months. \n\nThere are also some heuristics about designing a robust trading system. \n\nFirst, use simple strategies. Complicated systems have more parameters to fit and require more training data. They may work extremely well during backtest, but they are usually more sensitive to market conditions. In statistics, there is a theory called bias-variance tradeoff, i.e., if your model is too complex, you will get perfect fit on the history data, but for testing, it usually works poorly. If your model is too simple, it won't work on the history data so it's unlikely to work on the test data too. Choosing a very simple yet working system is important for robustness. \n\nSecond, get as much history data as you can. More data means better fit of your system and thus more robustness. Old data is useful, but recent data is most critical. The higher the sampling frequency, the better the data. \n\nThird, order books could help. Order books contain a lot of information, and Bitcoin exchanges usually publish their order books in real time. If you have a copy of the history order books, use them in your system.": 2, "You mentioned in another comment that you are using limit orders only, it wasn't clear from your post. My tests were for market orders using our own backtesting engine. With market orders you fight against the spread plus sell/buy through the order book which can be quite thin on OKCoin. It's better to overestimate slippage otherwise you could be trading money losing algorithms and those losses add up very quickly in HFT (or what passes for HFT in bitcoin land).\n\nLimit orders do not have slippage by definition but simulating limit orders is even more difficult. You have to simulate partial fills, full fills and cancellations that don't go through and result in a fill or partial fill. Order book data will help with that as well. As far as I understand your backtesting algorithm looks at executed trades only. Does is take into account if executed trades are buys or sells?\n\n> The average profit per trade in this experiment (according to the backtester) was in the order of 0.02 - 0.03%.\n\nWell this is a problem right there. I wouldn't trade any strategy that has such low average profit per trade during backtesting. Backtesting tends to overestimate the profit unless you use very conservative slippage estimates. There are too many assumptions that don't hold during live trading and you are testing your algorithm in ideal conditions. To test market-making bots that use limit orders we developed quite sophisticated backtesting engine that uses lots of data (full order book history, full trade history, lag measurements, order execution delay measurements) and still backtesting results never match live results anywhere close to 0.02% accuracy.\n\nAs others said the best way to test such algorithms is live trading with small amounts like 0.1 BTC per trade. Even then scaling up to 1 BTC you could expect your bot to perform up to 0.05-0.1% worse than with 0.1 BTC depending on the exchange.": 1, "So what are you trading against.

Haven\'t tried it myself, and I didn\'t have the best experience with their SMS service 1.5 years ago, but I\'m interested in how Locks is going.\n\nThe mention of BitShares is interesting for being counter party free, but there are trade offs:\n * The delegated proof of stake system has its own risks, especially if the users are not doing a good job with their responsibility to delegate\n * The white paper (http://whatisbitusd.com/whitepaper/) mentions that there is collateral risk that a black swan event could crash the BTS quickly enough to screw up a BitUSD position.\n\nThe long term answer to this is that folks wanting to hold credit money or decentralized market equivalents like BitUSD will probably want to put their eggs in multiple baskets. Good fintech has the potential to make this easy.\n\nFirst, imagine you have a wallet/keys/account on a particular network of your choice (Counterparty, NXT, Ripple, Stellar) that maintains an asset ledger for tracking credit relationships with the counter parties of your choice. Your client on this network could perform the following steps:\n\n1) Send requests to your preferred mix of inbound bitcoin bridges for bitcoin addresses to deposit to.\n\n2) From the total amount of bitcoin you\'re planning to deposit to these bridge-role counter parties, use your pre-defined % allocation to create a multi-output bitcoin transaction with the appropriate amount of bitcoin going to each bridge. This is either passed on to a separate bitcoin client/wallet or you have your credit network wallet be a dual wallet that also speaks to the bitcoin network. \n\n3) Once these multiple bridge counter parties have acknowledged their debt to you, your client executes trades from the mix of credit relationships that the inbound bridges left you with temporarily to the credit relationships you actually want to hold in. This is useful because there may be USD etc credit relationships you\'d like to have that do not themselves have bitcoin inbound service.\n\n4) If you also want to have some BitUSD in your portfolio, your client could also use an outbound bridge as a final step to go from having a credit balance with someone to  having BitUSD on the Bitshares network.\n\nCounterparty (proof of work blockchain) and NXT (proof of stake blockchain) will be popular with folks who want a network with the highest degree of censorship resistance (which is a separate matter from the counterparty risk you have holding an IOU under any circumstances)\n\nRipple and/or Stellar (including the new, more organic/internet style recently announced) will be popular with those who don\'t care about censorship resistance. For lacking that, Ripple and Stellar users will gain something really cool, a distributed network where you can "ripple" through a large chain of credit relationships atomically and very quickly. This has amazing implications for step 3 particularly, as the inbound bitcoin bridges you trust could be very well removed in terms of credit/trade relationships from the counter parties you want to hold USD with. (such as your stogey old bank [or grandparent extending your credit] that doesn\'t want to touch internet-crypto-commodity money with a 10 foot pole)\n\nFor this reason I consider any bullish news on Ripple/Stellar to be bullish for bitcoin, as bitcoin is going to be more popular to hold when there is better liquidity to trade it quickly to credit money and more popular to spend when there is the ability to just trade through from credit money as the held asset to bitcoin being received by the merchant and/or merchant\'s payment processor. The marketing exposure in the later part will also bring in more holders.': 2, "Don't know how to trust anyone who's not Bitfinex and OKcoin": 1, 'Keep bitcoins offline but hedge them completely by a short futures position on okcoin.

If you are using HTTP REST API to post trades, you will have to deal with DDOS protection limits. FIX API is much better because you are limited only by the exchange FIX engine speed. If you are using Java take a look at http://www.quickfixj.org/. It\'s also very important to use real-time websocket stream for market data.

BTCChina has FIX API as well.\n\n> how many seconds do i need to wait from sending the api a buy/sell request until the trade is approved?\n\nThere is no such thing as "approved trade", you probably meant "how long until my order is filled". You post your order using REST API or FIX API. The order might be declined right away. If it\'s declined you get an error from the API. If the order is not declined it becomes active on the exchange. If it\'s a market order, the matching engine matches it with limit orders on the order book. Matching the market order to limit orders produces one or more executed trades. At this point your order becomes filled (meaning that you bought or sold coins).\n\nThe execution speed depends on how well the matching engine works and how busy the exchange is. During high volume periods it can take seconds. With REST API you have to poll the order status to find out when your order is filled.
