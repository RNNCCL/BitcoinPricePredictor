For me, there have been two clear resistance level trendlines that I often reference.  The first one is a short term resistance level (Blue Line), and that is now broken.  The second one is a longer term trend line (Gold Line) that has generally held since the collapse of the last bubble.  Below is a really simple chart displaying the two.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/XfYxZId1/\n\nI believe we need to break above $500 in order for me to feel comfortable calling the bear market trend broken finally.\n\n**EDIT:** Earlier today in the 2nd Daily Discussion post I made a comment about the extreme bullishness people were exhibiting suddenly.  I've updated the chart to show why I was more reluctant to go full bull and drink the koolaid.\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/34djPFZY/\n\nIn the first chart I linked, I only discussed the long term downtrend and the recently broken short term downtrend.  However, on this second chart, I've added an additional downtrend resistance level from the February to Mid-May time period, and that downtrend resistance was actually quite similar to our most recent downtrend resistance line that was just breached bullishly.  Notice what happened on the breakout back in late may though.  We reacted with a strong bullish movement when the resistance level was broken, and we rallied for a couple weeks.  That rally ran out of steam when we reached the high point set by the prior spike around March 1st (as exhibited by the horizontal red line).  We couldn't break out above that for whatever reason.\n\nFlash forward to today, and I've drawn in 3 additional horizontal red lines that I believe could be similar stopping points like in the late May rally.  We didn't have a large rebound spike like on March 1st, so I'm just using the price points from right before the price broke down as potential stopping points.  Those stopping points basically are around $440, $480, and $525-530.  \n\nSure, the bull market could end up being in full swing and I might just be too cautious (I'm usually too cautious).  But I'm just looking at what the charts are telling me, and they're saying that this could be a repeat of the May rally, and the downtrend could ultimately continue.\n\nAnd as always, these are just my opinions.  Please do your own research before making any trading decisions.\n": 41, "Well it's TA, just one step above staring at tea leaves and one below the crystal ball.": 7, 'TABS': 2, 'Thanks mate!': 1, "I would add that the price levels of $590 and $685 could also end up being resistance, as they could form double tops for psychological reasons. People deciding to get out once they see an opportunity to break even. That's why double tops form and given the very long bear trend we've been in, there is probably still some lingering concern (your post is an excellent example of this) of a continuing bear trend. So, breaking even might seem like a great deal to a lot of people.\n": 5, "Yeah, the lines are definitely arbitrary, but I think if you read what he's actually saying, much of it makes sense at a psychological level.\n\nFind places in the past where the price was at a local maximum or minimum. People who bought at a local maximum but held are reasonably likely to now be in a wanting to break even mood, when they see the chance. So we can expect such places to have slightly more resistance than other price points. This is why double tops form.\n\nPeople who sold at a local minimum and have been hoping to buy back in even lower may become fearful that the price won't, in fact, go much lower. The moment it dips down to the point at which they sold, they might be tempted to buy back in. This is why double bottoms form.\n\nSo, we can expect that all prior local maxima from the current price all the way up to the ATH will have at least some added resistance relative to other nearby price points. Place emphasis on those maxima that had high volume, because half of that volume was buys, which means more people who might be wanting to break even at this point. Although, if things really get going, we might sail right through them and barely even notice. Also, the oldest of the local maxima are less likely to present resistance, as the folks who bought at those more distant maxima are more likely to have already changed their position.\n\nSo my current TA theory is this: the resistance against change (in either direction) at a given price point is proportional to the prior volume near that price point, inversely weighted by age (with some decay function applied to volume over time). This, IMO, could be a very robust TA tool. But, as I am not an active trader, I haven't made such a tool.\n\nI think trying to understand group behavior from a psychological point of view is the best you can do. Any TA that helps you see that is better than no TA at all, but people are impulsive enough as individuals... perhaps even moreso in groups. So, TA is imperfect, at best... in any case, I think the post you are griping about is (without directly saying as much) drawing attention to the psychological important of those prior maxima.": 7, 'I was going to post something similar to this, but you hit the nail on the head.

You do not have immediate access, however, because your payment for the bitcoin doesn't clear instantly.  We make an ACH debit from your linked US bank account.  ACH is a slow, batch process that takes 2-3 business days to clear.  Because buying bitcoin is an extremely risky process for us, and the level of attempted fraud is very high, we will hold the transaction for 4 business days to ensure that there is enough time for a return to be processed through the batch system.  This is to lower fraud rates, and allow more time for risk management in our back office.  When the funds finally clear from your bank account into our company operating account, we send you the bitcoin that we locked in at the rate when you authorized the purchase.\n\nWhen you sell, you must sell from your Novauri wallet (bitcoin address).  This is because under the hood, you must digitally sign to send this bitcoin from your Novauri wallet (you control the address) to our Novauri operating wallet address (a back office setup with multisig).

The funds are deposited into your US bank account also via ACH, which generally takes 2-3 days as a deposit.\n\nIn both cases, buy and sell, we do NOT take USD deposits from you.

But if you get more sophisticated about where and when you invest, and you start to hedge yourself by doing things like buying here and selling there, trading calendar spreads or hedging spot risk by shorting futures, this becomes a big deal. Trades that were once sure things become very risky. \n\nIf you\'re a business hedging risk, the situation becomes impossible. On a major spot move, any socialized loss whatsoever means lost money. \n': 4, "You can/will lose everything you have deposited.  Not only can you lose it through unsuccessful trading, you can also lose it through deceptive practices by OKCoin itself that facilitate the loss of your account.  \n\nFor instance, the 'stop loss' that they advertise on the the futures platform is not a standard market order stop loss, it is actually a limit order stop loss which should only be used by advanced traders who are in VERY close contact with their trades at all times.  While a market stop loss will liquidate your position completely, albeit at perhaps a lower price than your trigger, the limit stop loss will guarantee you the trigger price, but for only as much as it can execute.  If it cannot execute the full amount to be liquidated as the market moves beyond the trigger price, the order is cancelled and leaves a gaping hole in your account which will be emptied in its entirety if not caught immediately.\n\nWhy would a 0/low fee exchange present an advanced/extremely risky stop loss feature as a standard stop loss on highly leveraged trading and then go through the trouble to only provide this information buried in its disclosure statement?\n\nHow does one know that the contracts you are buying and selling on OKCoin are actually legitimate contracts with other traders, and that you are not actually playing against the House itself?\n\nThe answer is that you can't know these things because OKCoin is completely unregulated and their platform is completely non-transparent.  \n\nIf it's the case that you are playing futures against OKCoin itself and not in a legitimate market, you can be sure that your stop losses will not completely execute from time to time and that the spot price of the futures will oscillate wildly taking out tight stops, both long and short.  Only OKCoin can know if this is what is going on and only they can prove that this is not the case by providing transparency to their trading engine.\n\nUntil this happens, I will be inclined to think that OKCoin futures is probably a rigged 'bucket shop' and anyone who trades there is likely to lose most if not all their money.": 0, "No, you'll never owe more than the $1,000.

How quickly that pressure finds its way to the exchanges depends on too many variables to be safely predicted. If the purchaser intends to hodl, then the pressure will only be expressed as a lack of demand over time, as I expect they would have otherwise bought from a vendor that would have spread the purchase out over a few days in order to avoid slippage. But this is, of course, assuming that the buyer isn\'t a "buyer of opportunity," or someone who wouldn\'t have otherwise bought. There\'s also the question of how this auction will affect the behavior of the other bidders. Any bidder who is likewise a "bidder of opportunity," of course, will have a net zero effect, unless they happen to win at a higher price than the other bidders were bidding at.\n\nTo me, the most likely outcome seems to be a minor stalling of the market during the auction, and then a slight rise afterward. My intuition is that a person buying 50,000 BTC won\'t be looking to liquidate them on the open market immediately afterward, unless they can obtain them at a rate far below market price. I don\'t think they will be able to get them at a low enough rate to justify such a move, though, so I expect the winner to hold for a while afterward. I\'m basing this assumption on the outcome of the U.S. Marshals auction, where there were enough bidders to ensure the coins sold for very close to the spot price (as I understand it).\n\nSo we shouldn\'t see any immediate downward pressure from the buyer after the auction. That leaves the rest of the bidders. Some subset of those bidders will be people who just *want* bitcoin and were planning on buying at around this time anyway. This auction gives them an opportunity, but they\'re willing to get in another way if that doesn\'t work. The auction will keep them from acting until they find out if they\'ve won, tying up the funds they would have otherwise spent either on the exchanges or via a vendor specializing in big clients. Once the auction ends, though, there\'ll be some number of people who are looking to get bitcoin and who have the funds at the ready. I expect a reasonable percentage of *those* people to then spend their auction funds somewhere else.\n\n**All of *that* said,** there\'s going to be a lot of noise from everyone else around auction time. That could easily drown out the "signal," so to speak, even if my prediction as to what that "signal" will be proves correct. This is why I\'m presently a hodler who looks at fundamentals rather than a day trader.

This forms one of the cloud boundaries. It is referred to as Leading because it\xe2\x80\x99s plotted 26 days into the future and forms the \xe2\x80\x9cfaster\xe2\x80\x9d cloud boundary.  (Conversion Line + Base Line/2)).\n\nSenkou Span B (aka Leading Span B) is the midpoint between the 52 day high and the 52 day low in price. Formula: (52 day high + 52 day low/2)). This is the equivalent of 2 trading months. This is also plotted 26 days into the future and forms the \xe2\x80\x9cslower\xe2\x80\x9d cloud boundary.  \n\nPlease note that the spans are similar to 17 day (the midpoint of 9 and 26) and 52 day averages shifted forward.  The Cloud is formed from a shorter term and a longer term average snaking around each other shifted ahead of price.\n\nThe final component is the Chikou Span (aka Lagging Span).
