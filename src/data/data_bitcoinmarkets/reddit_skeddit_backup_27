Start by calculating a normal regression and grab the slope. But then calculate your own *median* (not mean) x and y value. Plug that median x, y value and the slope from the starter regression into the point-slope equation for a line.\n\nThen, starting from the slope as determined by a regular linear regression, adjust in small increments, both up and down, and calculate the sum of the squared residuals. You goal is to get the sum of the squared residuals as low as possible. Keep narrowing down with smaller and smaller increments until further improvements no longer make much of a difference - that's a bit of a judgement call.\n\nThat procedure will get you a pretty statistically sound regression, and is robust to outliers.\n\nOf course it will still change a lot if you do this with different sequences of the historical data.

I am interested in that possibility.\n\n>I dont think 1st world countries like USA / UK/ Germany etc will start using it full circle until their own currencies collapse (and I personally think they will within a few generations but thats a whole other topic)\n\nTwo things: "First world," is a political term, not an economic one. And the second, is that even in the presence of a currency collapse, it is very unlikely that policy enforcers would recognize bitcoin/cryptocurrencies as legitimate.\n\nTaxes are owed in whatever currency the local government demands. Estates and debts must be paid out in whatever currency policy demands. Based on its very nature, it is unlikely that BTC will achieve any status as a national currency even it picks up a market share in developing countries. \n\n>3600 BTC is currently 600 * $468.07 = $280842 per day. So for the price to remain level that level of money has to come in. \n\nIncorrect, but explaining this on my touch screen would be painful. \n\nThe quickest counter example is QE and the dollar. Massive QE, no change in dollar value.\n': 0, 'Bitcoin is a company (at least more than a currency, currencies are issued by the state who forces ppl to use its currency and requires taxes to be paid with it, there is no such state force with Bitcoin, the role of the state is the only thing that makes the term currency different from the term money. Bitcoin can fairly be described as money but not as a currency. Other than gold or sea shells though Bitcoin needs transaction verification work which makes the company analogy interesting since Bitcoin and a company has employees (miners in case of Bitcoin). It is all just analogies. But one or the other analogy makes more sense with respect to analyzing Bitcoin. BitShares is conceptually based on this company analogy / framework https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT9ICMfUDjk\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mwmlJICyRA': 0, '"Adoption goes up, Price goes down"\n\nWell, in my humble opinion, it isn\'t as simple as that statement.  There are a lot of other factors involved in that.  My first point/question would be how do you gauge adoption?  Are you only talking about merchant adoption?  Because most merchants aren\'t holding onto their BTC after a purchase, it\'s being converted by the merchant services company at the time of the transaction for a small fee, and there\'s some residual selling pressure that is put upon the market because of that.  It\'s not a 1 to 1 effect because the customers are buying their BTC before they eventually spend it with a merchant, so there is demand to offset the additional supply, but in my opinion there is a marginal increase in sell side pressure when new merchants begin accepting BTC (and not holding BTC after a transaction).\n\nMy next point would be more towards the "...price goes down" part.  Yes, the price may be going down, but the supply of the commodity is increasing by ~3,600 BTC daily.  So you can\'t just look at BTC like a stock and say "well the price went down today".  A better measure would be Bitcoin\'s market capitalization. Below is Blockchain\'s chart of Bitcoin market cap, in Log scale, I believe I have it set at 2 years.\n\nhttps://blockchain.info/charts/market-cap?showDataPoints=false&show_header=true&daysAverageString=1&timespan=2year&scale=1&address=\n\nYou can see that while the market cap is still pretty low compared to the last peak, it\'s still much higher than the market cap set in the prior bubble (March 2013).  Bitcoin is adding millions of dollars worth of new coins each day, so if the price remains stable on a given day, that actually means that there was enough organic demand to eat up those new 3,600 BTC that were mined.  Again, that\'s not necessarily a 1-to-1 ratio either because many miners don\'t automatically put those coins out on the market, but you get what I\'m saying.\n\nBasically, the market price doesn\'t have to move up just because there\'s a lot of positive news in our eyes.  To the layman with little knowledge of BTC, pretty much none of this news is something that they would bother to pay attention to.  The people who are already fans of BTC will be ecstatic about the news, but what will actually drive the price is getting new people interested in BTC.  Increased consumer adoption is the driving force of the price. ': 8, 'Where has adoption gone up?  Merchant adoption?

It's an increase in demand at the consumer side due to larger merchant adoption that influences the price.\n\nMore merchants accepting it makes it a more viable currency, and thus increases the overall demand of it.\n\nOne last thing to note is that merchant adoption and increase in bitcoin demand don't necessarily follow each other instantaneously. A lot of bitcoins were bought before the recent large increase in merchant acceptance, meaning that initially, it's possible that people finally use the bitcoins they bought earlier before buying new ones. There are, of course, also a lot of other dynamics at play which influence the price.": 4, 'My theory is that the miners are mostly responsible. Bitcoin was very overvalued during, and for a time after, the last bubble. This high value spurred miners to invest in tons of expensive equipment expecting a return as long as Bitcoin remained high.

On this we agree.\n\nIf you generate income from bitcoin, its also taxable.  If you sell a service or product for bitcoin (or other currency), its taxable, even if you hold the bitcoin (or other currency) after the sale.  See Q-3 here:  http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-drop/n-14-21.pdf  And when a miner generates bitcoin, its taxable, even if they hold the bitcoin.  See Q-8 at prior link.  \n\nThe idea is that "income tax" is taxed based on when you receive income, which is derived from a a sale of goods or service.  At the time of sale, the value of what you sold things or services for is taxed based on the value of payment, less the cost of generating that sale.  Whether you are paid in dollars, euros, bitcoin, monero, a goat, a painting, or whatever, it doesn\'t matter.  You have generated taxable income.\n\nFor capital gains purposes, the logic is a little different.  When you invest in an asset (real estate, stocks, commodities, bitcoin, painting, etc) no taxation occurs.  The rationale is that you are using cash (or other assets) that you own, and have already paid tax on from whatever activity generated the cash.  The nice thing is that the IRS does not require to mark your asset to market.  I.e. if you buy bitcoin at $400, and it goes to $1,000, you are not taxed if you hold the asset.  You are only taxed when the the value of that asset appreciates **and** there is a "recognition" event such that tax is paid.  The most common recognition event is you have sold that asset.\n\nSo no, I don\'t think there is a tax arbitrage angle on bitcoin for corporations.

It's the rigidity that is a good sign for a disruptive technology.\n\nSo for example it is difficult to imagine either taxi license holding incumbents or cities that benefit from restricting such licenses adapting enough to fully counter someone like Uber.  That's why the incumbents need to bring out the regulatory ban hammers.\n\nThe Apple new platform is interesting because up until now there are multiple incumbents attempting to preserve and extend monopoly profits.

In a BTC transaction you need to place your trust entirely in the merchant to uphold their end of the deal or refund you.\n\n* Anonymity? You're given the merchant your address.

The net cost of my CC (including merchant inflated prices to cover interchange fees and my cash rewards program) is about 1% for card-not-present transactions.  The cost for merchants to accept BTC-USD through Bitpay is 1%. Then you add on the cost of the customer buying Bitcoin to begin with (0.35-1% depending on the country/exchange).

They called it "kinibbling" for the check.  Although the company would ultimately reimburse, it would put an inconvenience and cash crunch on the person who got stuck with the bill.\n\nEach person around the table would be given 3 of the same small objects (coins, matches, etc).  And then each person would put some number between zero and three into their right hand.  Then, you go around the table guessing what the total in all the right hands is.  Your guess can\'t be the same as anyone before you.  If you guess the total exactly, then you are eliminated from the game, and don\'t get stuck with the check.\n\nThe starting guesser advances one space each round, so the same person doesn\'t start each time.  And when you get down to two people remaining (usually sweating profusely), you have to win twice to be removed from the game (so sort of "best out of three" with the "ties / no winner" removed).  This helps to balance any advantage of getting to guess first (or last) among two people.\n\nSo with ten people at the beginning of the game, you figure the average might be 1.5 each, so you guess around 15.

The miners are crucial to protecting the network, but the fork doesn\'t cease to exist if it has 49% of the hashing rate. I think the exchanges have a much more powerful position in a hard fork than the miners.  Imagine a hard fork that hurts the miners but is generally good for the merchants.  Companies like BitPay and the exchanges would likely side with the merchants. If the exchanges unanimously agree to use a lesser hashed fork, that essentially gives the other fork a monetary value of $0.  The truth is that an agreement between the exchanges could force through any fork they wanted and the miners would follow because they cant mine worthless coins with their expensive overhead and razor thin margins.

MC=MV...\nIf 3600 coins are made a day, each worth $15,000... this means that miners WILL SPEND (probably more than) \n$54,000,000 per day mining them. (miners spend $2M /day now [!!])\n\nSo, this WOW big industry, has its income halved overnight. Now 1800 coins will be generated each day, with a total value of just $27M. If miners have no other options, then that\'s probably the end of the story. They\'ll have to suck it up. \n\nIf Other "altcoins" are available to mine more profitably, then you\'d expect a fairly major move away from bitcoin. This would weaken the (by then, hard as nails) network strength (hash rate). It could be disastrous! It could be fine. Last halving day was absolutely fine, as ASICS we\'re just hitting the scene, and hash rate was starting to explode. \n\nSome curveball factors to consider:\n\n- Bitcoin may have moved away from Proof of Work, and SHA256 by then. (only with the consensus of the network [miners, wallet software and probably core developers])\n- It could be that governments/huge business would be involved in mining, to protect it (?thats my crazy idea)\n- It is likely that blockchain innovations will be a big deal, and there could be some other very strong (profitable) mining "rivals" to bitcoin. It might be that POW SHA256 is seen as "caveman crude", and mining bitcoin keeps miners "locked in" to a technical dead end (good!)\n\nSome more solid points:\n\n- If the "money into" mining is halved, the market to design new mining hardware will evaporate (however temporarily). \n- the market price could be doing anything around then. Crashing, bubbling. This would affect the impact the halving would have on miners income. \n- the price could be far higher or lower. Bitcoin could be everywhere or dead or niche. \n- if price has risen, already the money (and electricity) spent on mining would be head bending. This would suggest that mining would be \'at the limit\' of chip technology. This could be viewed as a "safe" thing.\n- if price has dropped, or remained low, then mining income being slashed could be bad news. If bitcoin was fighting for it\'s life with some altcoin at the time, then this could be the nail in the coffin. \n- Any serious 51% attack would not go "through the front door" though. I\'m not an expert, but I expect "hash rate being high enough" to be high enough. I.e, if it were the same as now, in 2 years time, that might be fine. \n\nOther points that are slightly related\n\n- mining centralisation is a weakness (more so than hash rate). With 1 gun you could get quite a lot of the network. \n- 51% attack does not seem like such a big deal to me. It would be an annoying, but far from fatal blow. The problem is that "it being open" is unacceptable. \n\nRead Tim "[I don\'t like bitcoin](http://www.ofnumbers.com/the-anatomy/)" Swanton\'s book if you want a sobering reality check on all that bitcoin has become, risks becoming and needs to be, to survive/annihilate. \n\n## Paid?

It\'s just a folly of humans. \n\nEDIT: of direct interest to traders\n\n- in theory, worst case hashrate would drop by 50%, exposing the network to 51% attack through (now easier) brute force\n- with half the inflation prices would rise. \n- users might face higher transaction fees if network security was an issue, or simply to encourage fees to protect the network (they will have to be the sole source of incentive to mine later.': 9, "Have you ever seen this laid out or discussed before?

Essentially this means on a basic level difficulty increases to offset hashrate... but in reality if hashrate increases quickly enough difficulty adjustments are insufficient to maintain the production schedule.

Markets hate unknowns and the sudden halving is a big stinking "unknown" for everyone particularly miners.  /end edit\n\nI also think that a change to mining payouts could be made in about a year with little disruption to the mining network. \n\nI say this because while block rewards would start decreasing gradually, they won\'t decrease significantly over the life of an asic miner. That means at first everything will chug along exactly as before (since the reward starts off the same as it was under the old halving scheme and then tapers) and will only have changed a little bit by the time the current generation of hardware is obsolete. This means that miners should be able to anticipate and scale their future hardware expectations accordingly and still receive the expected payout of their current generation hardware. \n\nThat means that miners do not face any sudden changes to deal with and the gradual deflationary effect will support prices.\n\nI think it\'s doable if presented correctely and if the turnover of a generation of asics is built into the timeline. \n\nEdit: words': 2, 'You know you can link to comments, right?

I had taken the understanding that when difficulty adjusts it accounts for the past chunk of blocks in such a way as to bring the rate of production into line...

"I, Satoshi, mined the first rewarded block, and no one else can ever get more coins per block than I got."  - this might have been important in the formative early years.\n\n- maintaining a high payout early provides miners more of an incentive to really commit to mining.  The goal was to get lots of miners to get lots of strength of network, and it worked.  Not sure it would have been as effective, if there wasn\'t a 4-year constant payout.\n\n- It\'s simpler to make sure there is agreement between all users and software platforms.

They contain no *explicit* dependence on the other, which means that they may still both move with regards to some underlying variable, but unless they share that implicit dependence then a movement in one does not imply a movement in the other.\n\nSpecifically for bitcoin, supply in the mining sense depends on *nothing* and is a completely known function of time. There are no variables that supply depends on. Therefore, the supply movement does not mean any of the determinants of demand are changing, not even expectations regarding future supply because we already know in advance exactly how many coins are going to be divied up by miners.\n\n': 6, 'Good point.  Ultimately the miners decide, but merchants and exchanges have some power to convince them.\n\nIMO merchants could/should care more about the effects of abrupt reward changes than exchanges do.

Those retailers that immediately sell 100% of the Bitcoin they accept in exchange for their good sure doesn't do anything to affect the price, and if retailers forever convert 100% of their funds to fiat that's totally irrelevant, right?

Nothing at all. Know why? They weren\'t holding Bitcoin in the first place. They weren\'t a source of demand.\n\n\nYou need to think this through.

That right there is the sale that would put marginal downwards pressure on the price.\n\n\nNow, instead, if a merchant like NewEgg accepts Bitcoin for a PlayStation, and then converts it to fiat immediately, it is again going to involve a sale of Bitcoin which puts marginal downward pressure on the price.\n\n\nIn both cases, the change in demand stemmed from **me**, not the merchant. I wanted a PlayStation rather than Bitcoin. That is what resulted in the "sale" or "exchange" wherein Bitcoin was converted into dollars and a console arrived at my house.\n\n\nThis is not an opinion, this is a fact. The merchant was never a source of Bitcoin demand (until they, like Overstock or Amagi Metals, decide to become one) and thus play **no role** in the Bitcoin price changes. \n\n\nThe *only* relevant factor is the consumer who decides to hold less Bitcoin and enjoy more goods/services.\n\n\nYou can\'t argue with this (and I notice you haven\'t tried, instead resorting to weak ad hominem attacks) because it is obviously true.

Now you should be able to understand that since it is the exact same thing, there is no difference between whether the merchant accepts Bitcoin or not; it is *you* who is performing the sale.\n\n>You didn\'t want to sell your BTC, you wanted to spend it\n\nThose are the exact same thing. "Selling" Bitcoin is just spending it on dollars. You\'re trying to fabricate a discrepancy that does not exist, solely to try and preserve a negative spin on a situation where one does not actually exist. \n\n\n>There\'s a gigantic difference between a customer spending BTC at a retailer who uses it within their own business and a retailer that immediately dumps it.\n\nSure there is. There just aren\'t any retailers who use it within their own business (except for outliers like Overstock and Amagi Metals) so this difference is irrelevant to the real world. \n\nOne day, if B2B Bitcoin starts taking off, we\'ll see the price start to climb as a result. Until then, you\'re comparing reality with a fantasy and saying "Look at the differences between the two!" Of course there are differences, the latter scenario is located entirely in your imagination.\n\n\n>here just for fun, look at you contradicting yourself\n\n>>No, the retailers converting to fiat does nothing to the price.\n\n>>if a merchant like NewEgg accepts Bitcoin for a PlayStation, and then converts it to fiat immediately, it is again going to involve a sale of Bitcoin which puts marginal downward pressure on the price.\n\nI did not contradict myself, because the entire point was that **the downward pressure on the price was a direct result of the consumer converting their Bitcoin into something else, rather than the retailer**. In other words, the marginal downward pressure on the price was not because the retailer converted to fiat, it was because the consumer cashed out their Bitcoin into a fancy new PS4; there is no self-contradiction, you just appear to have misunderstood the entire point.\n\nOnce again, since you appear to be feebly trying to dodge the actual point I\'m making: **IT IS THE CONSUMER WHO IS DECIDING TO LESSEN DEMAND FOR BITCOIN, NOT THE MERCHANT**. The merchant was never a source of Bitcoin demand until they have explicitly stated otherwise. \n\nIt\'s not my fault that you confused the statement "Dell accepts Bitcoin" with that of "Dell is going to acquire and hold Bitcoin". You confused yourself; I\'m just doing my best to clarify things so that you understand better.\n\nIf you need further help or explanation, just ask. Being friendly is a much better tactic when you\'re confused about something.': 0, '> It\'s frankly pretty ridiculous to run an ecosystem wherein every use of a currency drives its price down.\n\nIt\'s frankly pretty ridiculous to consider this ridiculous. What matters, in terms of affecting the price, is not whether or not retailers accept BTC as payment - that has absolutely zero effect on price. The *only* affect that has is on the perceived legitimacy of Bitcoin in society, and that effect is a positive one.\n\n\nIn terms of price, the only thing that matters is demand (remember: supply is stably increasing and predictable). If someone wants sheets or PS4s more than they want Bitcoin, they will exchange the Bitcoin for their desired good, whether they first have to convert to $ or not. It doesn\'t matter whether the merchant converts it to fiat immediately after a sale processed through Coinbase or Bitpay; the only important consideration is that the consumer who bought the product wanted that product more than they wanted to invest their money into Bitcoin. *That* is the relevant change in demand. The merchant may or may not hold BTC (as you\'ve observed with as much negative spin as you can muster, not many companies who do not ideologically believe in Bitcoin currently do opt to hold coins) but they should already be assumed to not be giant sources of increased demand. Saying "Dell accepts Bitcoin" is not saying "Dell will now use Bitcoin for everything they do" and you\'re an idiot if you ever thought it did. If Dell *did* do something like that, the influx of Dellish demand would easily rocket the price tag up a few hundred bucks. Maybe one day something like that will happen. Right now, again, if you expect such, you\'re just dumb, end of story.\n\n\nSo, to recap: it doesn\'t matter that merchants convert all their Bitcoin payments to fiat, because they have never been the source of **demand** that has affected the price of Bitcoin. What matters is the change in Bitcoin demand which is manifest through the buyer(s) in the process; if they want to liquefy their Bitcoin holdings to instead buy goods or services, that is their prerogative, and the only difference in the equation now is that they pay less fees to do so.\n\n\nNow quietly retire the retarded argument that merchants accepting Bitcoin represent a huge downward pressure on the price.

This counters curve-fitting - an easy trap to fall into.\n- People saying *bots don\'t work* have never run a successful bot\n- People saying *backtesting won\'t match results* haven\'t spent enough time wondering why and overcoming these issues.

[Everett Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Rogers), a professor of [communication studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_studies), popularized the theory in his book *Diffusion of Innovations*; the book was first published in 1962, and is now in its fifth edition (2003).  Rogers argues that diffusion is the process by which an [innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation) is communicated through certain channels over time among the participants in a social system. The origins of the diffusion of innovations theory are varied and span multiple disciplines. Rodgers proposes that four main elements influence the spread of a new idea: the innovation itself, communication channels, time, and a social system. This process relies heavily on [human capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital). The innovation must be widely adopted in order to self-sustain. Within the rate of adoption, there is a point at which an innovation reaches [critical mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass_(sociodynamics\\)). The categories of adopters are: innovators, [early adopters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_adopters), early majority, late majority, and laggards.  Diffusion manifests itself in different ways in various cultures and fields and is highly subject to the type of adopters and innovation-decision process.\n\n>====\n\n>[**Image from article**](https://i.imgur.com/4QY8xgr.jpg) [^(i)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:DoI_Stages.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Everett ^Rogers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Rogers) ^| [^Innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation) ^| [^Pro-innovation ^bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pro-innovation_bias) ^| [^Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ck30wph) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+ck30wph)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)': 1, 'I thought it was, "Bitcoin goes up, Bitcoin goes down.

After 6 stunted months, there are signs that the effects of MtGox are finally starting to wane and that bitcoin is finally moving away from that debacle (more on this later).\n\nTime will tell, but I see yesterday as a generally good day - ApplePay will only bring more public attention to the idea of digital and mobile payments, and this should be a good thing for bitcoin. I could be completely wrong and it may end up being bad, however I don\'t think bitcoin has to worry about Apple. Some of the reasons are:\n\n* Aside from eliminating the need to store credit card numbers, ApplePay is essentially a copy of many other existing services like Google Wallet.\n* Even with this extra feature, ApplePay is inferior to bitcoin in almost every single way: centralized; reliance on legacy systems like credit cards (which most of the world doesn\'t have); reliance on bank accounts (which most of the world doesn\'t have); region-locked to each specific currency; same fees as credit cards; no ability to easily send money between person A and B; no ability to send money across the world for "free"; not useful for remittances; it\'s dumb-money, unlike bitcoin which can be used for smart contracts; proprietary system with no access by non-Apple products; I could go on and on, you get the point...\n* ApplePay is currently locked exclusively to iPhone 6. Even if Apple sells 100 million iPhone 6\'s within a year (unlikely), that\'s 1.5% of the world\'s population. Considering Apple\'s less tech-savvy clientele, maybe 10% of owners would even use ApplePay. That means 99.85% of the world would still have no clue about or no access to ApplePay. Compare this to bitcoin which can be used by almost anyone, on any platform, on any device. In a year\'s time, where will bitcoin be and how much more evolved will its ecosystem be? To answer that, just look at where bitcoin was last year.\n\nApplePay aside, I see only good things happening in the ecosystem. We all know about all the good news lately. However, what excites me is the charts. [[Every](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-transactions-excluding-popular?showDataPoints=false&timespan=2year&show_header=true&daysAverageString=7&scale=0&address=)] [[single](https://blockchain.info/charts/n-unique-addresses?showDataPoints=false&timespan=2year&show_header=true&daysAverageString=7&scale=0&address=)] [[chart](https://blockchain.info/charts/my-wallet-n-tx?showDataPoints=false&timespan=2year&show_header=true&daysAverageString=7&scale=0&address=)] on Blockchain.info shows that after 4-5 months of decline / stagnation from MtGox\'s February implosion, we\'re **finally** heading up and even surpassing the pre-MtGox numbers. \n\nTo top it off, LocalBitcoins has had [record days in 7 of the last 8 days](https://bitcoincharts.com/charts/localbtcUSD#rg30zigDailyzczsg2012-08-01zeg2014-09-10zm1g10zm2g25zi1gVolzvzcv), and looking at the long-term chart, it\'s obvious that numbers are consistently growing month after month.\n\nIn short, I\'m seeing despair and panic in the markets, but nothing but positive signs in the fundamentals.

I would say both.\n\nHowever, a borrower will say that since you will get your battery (i.e. the materials) back, he should pay you very little and pay nothing for the electric charges consumed. This is how the borrower steals from you.\n\nThe borrower will use the electric charges stored in the battery just like a margin trader can take out the value in BTC by shorting it. When the borrower returns the battery with no electric charges left inside, you get your battery back without charges just like the margin trader returns your BTC with a much lower price. The borrower depleted your battery and it is worthless now if it is non-rechargable. You or someone, **not the borrower**, will have to pay to recharge it if it is a rechargeable battery. Even if it is a rechargeable battery, the battery can be dead if the borrower abused it with some extreme charge and discharge cycle. So, it is possible that Bitcoin will be dead in the near future.\n\nAll that tells real bitcoin believers that the rates for BTC swap should match the volatility of BTC we have seen in the past. Then, the merchants who really support BTC should accept **and keep** their BTC to cut its tie to fiat.

Given that hashrate is the only thing that actually ties bitcoin to fiat, I was interested to see if a model could link price and hashrate. On an emotional level, u/bit_by_bit was excessively belligerent when defending a model that had some issues, which is likely why you saw so much hate/downvotes. There are plenty of flawed models around here that get consistently upvoted, but whose authors are nice.\n\nOf course, so far I've only criticized the modeler, and not the model itself. Here are my two main (and related) concerns:\n\nFirst and foremost, I remember that the analysis would change often and, after each change, would match the price to closely compared to the standard error. This suggests a lack of predictive power, and a tailoring of the model to fit the results. As well the error bars seem to small, with not all the error accounted for. In particular is the error on the hashrate. The hashrate is essentially the blocks mined/day times a proportionailty constant determined by the difficulty. Given the nature of bitcoin, the number of blocks mined/day is given by a poisson distribution with N=144 (so the mean and variance are both 144). When N is this large, the poisson distribution can be approximated by a normal curve with a mean and variance of 144 (as long as you don't go to far towards the tails). The standard deviation of this poisson is sqrt(144) = 12. The SD/mean is 12/144 = .0833. Therefore, about 1/3 of your estimates should be at least ~8.3% away from the mean ($50 when the price was $600). However, your estimates were more accurate, implying some tampering with the model. As well, the 95% confidence range (2 standard deviations) should be at least  ~\xc2\xb116% (\xc2\xb1 $100 at $600) even before taking into account other sources of error. Unfortunately, this error will always be present for any daily analysis whose price is proportional to hashrate since we can't measure the real hashrate, but only the number of blocks mined/day.\n\nSecond, hashrate currently seems uncorrelated with price and is exponentially rising, even on short timescales (weeks and months) where price has fallen. So an analysis on a very short timescale (1 day) does not seem to be necessary. Price may be a cap on hash rate, but hashrate has not yet reached that cap, so hashrate will likely grow until it does reach the cap.\n\nP.S. In the discussion on standard deviation, I assumed that the hashrate you used was a result of 1 day averaging. Averaging over multiple days would improve the expected standard deviation, but then you should have only posted the fundamentals once per hashrate averaging cycle to preserve statistical independence.": 5, "It is, but it's difficult (haha) to predict, which can result in a large margin of error: the jagged red line represents difficulty https://bitcoinwisdom.com/bitcoin/difficulty": 3, "I don't get where that animosity comes from.

If you disagree with even the tiniest aspect you are the most despicably retarded moron that has ever had a keyboard in front of them" attitude.\n\n\nIf the guy were a little less cocksure I\'m sure he\'d be one of the most liked members of the sub.\n\n\nOne final note: price doesn\'t follow hashrate. Price ebbs and flows as a function of demand. So his model would be a little better for /r/BitcoinMining or something, since hashrate *is* (at least to some degree) a function of price.': 3}, ('JL Script - new script language for advanced traders', 23): {"Hi all, does anyone have an old or sample QT Trader script they could share, I'm trying to get started with scripting a basic algorithm with QT Trader but need a little bootstrapping...
