So was Buffett just in the top 0.0000000005% of investors based on pure luck because *someone* has to be? I don\'t know.

You are correct, that just stopping now would lead to an outperformance.

Sure, a early investor in bitcoin who put in $30 as a joke in 2010 would outperform technically for the rest of his life.  But was this really skill?  I would say no.  He got lucky.  /u/compounding brought up this next filter.  Basically survivorship bias...if you ahve 1 million monkeys trading stocks, 1 or 2 will outperform even on my 10 year time horizon.  that doesn\'t imply the monkey had skill.\n\nWhat i really want to see is a sustainable trading strategy that leads to outperformnace.

Often is shows the borrowers\' time range is 2-30 days, but if you hit the bid with a 30 day offer, nothing happens. Today I hit a 30-day bid below the FRR, nothing happened. So the bids were not up to date, and one really could not know about the going rate.

A better product can make it to the market.  Personally, I think that big governments are going to find a way to make existing currency more conducive to digital marketplaces.  Even if that doesn\'t happen, a better digital currency could pop up.\n\n2. A known vulnerability could be exploited (51% attack?) or a new vulnerability can be discovered.

If *any* of the following things don\'t happen, bitcoin is destined for failure:\n\n1. An easy and secure system of both storing and selling bitcoins must be developed.  I\'m relatively tech savvy, but even I don\'t feel like I have the knowledge or resources available to easily and reliable store and spend bitcoin.  How can you expect mass adoption if early adopters have trouble getting up to speed?\n\n2. Big money must be able to get into the market.  Major traders and retailers need a legal, reliable, and secure method to gain exposure to bitcion.  The SEC and its international counterparts must create a framework in which major players can interact with bitcoin.  \n\n3. The 1mb limit must be resolved.  \n\n4. There must be incentive to spend bitcoin.  Right now, I have no reason to do transactions in bitcoin.  It\'s much, much easier to use my credit/debit card, cash, or a service like paypal.

In fact, every time you take out a swap you will pay interest for at least one hour, even if you close the swap after say 2 minutes. \n\nIf a swap expires after say 48 hours, Bitfinex goes again to the swap market and takes again the cheapest offer available. \n\nIf you think the interest rate on your swap is too high and you see cheaper offers in the market simply close your swap manually and let Bitfinex take out new, cheaper ones. \n\nYou can also do this manually, by taking out new swaps yourself first and then manually closing old swaps used to cover positions.

I think they still offer 2.5:1 leverage on either.  The short I described above wasn't describing any leverage, just how a short sell works.  On Bitfinex, you could go long and borrow USD to buy bitcoins (with or without leverage), and you now owe someone USD meaning you have to sell bitcoins at market rate to repay them.  When you borrow funds, USD or BTC, you do so from a lender and repay them the amount plus an interest fee.\n\nThere's significantly more risk of losing all of your money on a true short vs what you did.  In what you did, the BTC price would have to crumble to $0 USD for you to have lost all your money.  That's probably not going to happen very quickly so the risk of losing it all isn't so great.  \n\nNow, let's say you opened a true short of 10 BTC at $450.  You borrow 10 BTC from a lender, sell all 10 and make $4,500.  Some great news happens and the bitcoin price dramatically rises, you aren't around to close the short  and after a few days it reaches $950.  Either you come in and close it fearing its going higher or a margin call goes out.  You now have to reimburse the 10 BTC to the lender.  You buy 10 BTC at $950 for $9,500 and give them back to the lender.  You now are in the hole $5,000 ($9,500-$4,500 - interest fees too).  You lost more money than you would have if the BTC price at $450 went completely to $0.

They all get bot. :-)\n\nThe whale was smart to hover there just above us with his 1-2k wall pressing us down, but never committing his stack to the ask. He was testing your fears, my fears. We bent a bit. I took a small loss on over trading, but we did not break. If he really sold, he would not have bot back better.\n\nSo I think the whales will need to deal with the reality of rising support in the 20DMA. Time will come when they get pressed and tested. Not to worry fellow guppies. \n\nI'm a hodler still, and I'm looking for margin long. The daily ADX is at 35 down 20 from 55 seven days ago. Anything over 30 is trend, so we still have trend according to the ADX for a few more days. Daily MACD is crossing tomorrow, a sell signal for some, but I think it will be false one. Its just saying momentum is over. And that is what we are seeing here at the 200. The 20 is coming in for a landing and the bears will have to deal with it. Its for fuel and bulls only. Mo mo to resume shortly.\n\nHere's a channel I've been watching since lift off.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Q0foNUE\n\nHere it is from back at lift off\n\nhttp://imgur.com/Q0foNUE\n\nAnyhow we are above the top of the channel. On closer inspection, the top of the channel is the lower part of this bull pennant in which we are now trading. And the trajectory of the 20day strikes the left end of the pennant.\n\nhttp://imgur.com/zqj2I7I\n\nI suspect the whale will try to make an attack when the 1 day MACD crosses. This should be confirmed by dip in the RSI.\n\nBut this attack will fail. There is just too much accumulation going on.\n\nBe patient.\n\nI have margin long entries sprinkled throughout the $670's.\n\nI'm doing this because it is a symmetrical triangle set up, not a high base. My high base plan was to get in at $680 to $685, but I think once the pattern breaks up, it will go like a rocket. Stop Buy orders will get filled anywhere between $685 and $710.  I hate getting filled at the top end of a green candle.

I would suggest you look into adding temporal aspects to your net structure (check the literature for examples) and/or investigating better activation functions (which, if suitable, can eliminate extra hidden layers.) (EDIT: of these two, I\'d likely start with activation functions before looking into more esoteric network structures.)\n\nAs for getting better results as you train it more and more, that is not surprising. What would be interesting to know is how long it holds predictive power as you run it with training stopped. To "forward-test" it, rather than the large-scale backtesting you have been doing so far.': 1, "That's a good question. I did train it on the same data that I tested it on. And yes, I know this brings up concern about over-fitting. However, I did not train the neural network to be as profitable as possible - I trained it to predict high and low prices. Testing involved seeing how profitable it would be by setting buy/sell values to these predictions (and overriding the buy/sell values to -/+ 5% during periods of low volatility). I also measured the average errors of predicted high and low prices. The neural network that performed the best was not the one with the lowest average error. In fact, the average error was high enough that there is no way it was over-fitting (if it were over-fitting, it would have had a very low average error).\n\nI've written some neural networks that clearly were over-fitting or overgeneralizing, and it is very clear to see this from the outputs. From testing a lot of neural networks for predicting bitcoin prices on both test data and new data, I can confidently say that this model is not over-fitting.": 0, "You cannot test a net against its training data and get results with any predictive power. Don't let your sense of the error rate mislead you. All you have done is verify how well your net can reproduce the expected outputs for its training set.\n\nYou will need to retrain it with a blind and then test the new resulting net. In other words, hold back one or more ranges of input data (preferably a randomly-selected set of ranges) during training and then test the net against the withheld data.": 8, "Actually I've watched the neural network that predicts the 24 hour forecast on my website's error and it consistently has been getting lower and lower since I put it up about 3 months ago. The reason is because it has more data to train on. Even this small, extra 3 months of data makes a significant difference in the neural network's performance (which as I stated before, I know is not overfitting having seen its performance against real future data). Furthermore, training on 90% and testing on 10% would not be a very comprehensive test. 10% of the bitcoin price data would be very far from representative of bitcon price trends in general.\n\nI can assure you that it is very, very hard to find a perfect training fit on this data set (you can download it and try it yourself if you'd like: http://api.bitcoincharts.com/v1/csv/). The best I've been able to do is an average error of about 0.6% using a HUGE four layer neural network, which was definitely overfitting. By huge, I mean something like 90 ish inputs, 800 nodes in each of the two hidden layers, 96 output nodes corresponding with the average price over each 15 minute period for the next 24 hours. It took all day to train and was very overfitted. As I stated before, I don't think this can even be done with a three layer neural network. I certainly haven't done it.": 0, "Input structure is definitely higher on my list than activation functions, too, so you are on a good path by focusing there first. Many folks don't, and I think they are making a mistake.\n\nAs for forward versus back, bear with me as I go back to the whole training vs testing thing for a bit. If you test on your training data then you are not testing and evolving the nets predictive power, just its ability to reproduce the training outputs given the training inputs. Unless you test it on unforeseen data you have no measure of its abilities.\n\nDon't let yourself get fooled into thinking that error rate is tied directly to fitting. You can have low error without having overfitted. That could just be a good net, particularly if you've pulled that off while keeping the node count down. You can have higher error and feel confident that you have avoided overfitting, but that could just be a shitty net. You can, more critically, hit a sweet spot where you have a middling amount of error against the test data during training _but then have good predictive power on unforeseen data after stopping training and starting just running_. \n\nBut you can only determine this fitness by testing against unforeseen data, and there are just two ways you can do that, effectively two kinds of unforeseen data: one that can be fed into your training process and one that can only be used to measure things afterwards:\n\n#1. A blind. Hold back a random subset of historical data, probably in the single digits of percentage, largely depending on available data. Train against the rest. Test against only the withheld data. Re-enforce training and/or alter the net structure iteratively from there. The results against the withheld data provide an immediate sense of fitness and you can feed this back into improvements immediately.\n\n#2. Test it forward. Train against everything you've got, holding no data back. Your only option now, though, to determine fitness and make improvements, is to then stop training and run the net on new data as it arrives, measuring the nets output as things happen. (Or you stop training and then just wait a while, collect a bunch of new data, and then test against that. Then you'll have effectively created a blind of sorts, _but not one that was used to refine things during training and adjustments_.)\n\nEither way you really need to be doing _both_, in a sense:\n\nYou need #1s blind so that you can do better training. You also need #2s real world results so that you can measure predictive power, and to provide evidence that you didn't just somehow fluke into fitting the blind nicely but without creating a net that can be predictive going forward.\n\nWhen I reference testing forward, it is this #2 that I mean. If you turn off training and just let the net run, it becomes very interesting to know how long it holds what amount of predictive power.\n\nDoing #1 is good.\nDoing #2 is good, if you don't mind your overall training process taking a much longer period of time.\nDoing both is best.\nDoing neither invalidates nets and results.\n\nEDIT: a few words.": 1, 'I have done quite a bit of experimentation with layer sizes/number of layers, but the main thing I\'ve been experimenting with recently is input representations. I do not use a simple x number of hourly prices leading up to the present anymore - I use a combination of prices over various intervals of time prior to the present, and I\'ve found this can do a lot better.\n\nI haven\'t yet done a lot with different activation functions. I\'ve only been using sigmoid since that is generally considered an overall solid one to use for most purposes. That is something I may look into messing around with in the future.\n\nI\'m not sure what you mean by running it with training stopped and "forward-testing".': 0, "Yeah totally reasonable to be skeptical.

You can also compare it's past predictions to actual prices, and see the average error obtained by testing it on the same data it trained on. In general, it does about as well on real, future data as it does on test data. Sometimes it is less accurate, and sometimes it is more accurate, but the average error from the training data is a pretty accurate representation of its accuracy on new data. It is capable of generalizing.\n\nThis is true of the neural network I have presented here as well. If it were over-fitting, it would be much more accurate.\n\nThe thing is, in order for the issue of separating test and training data to really be an issue, you have to be dealing with a neural network that is complicated enough and data sample that is simple enough. The neural network that I'm using is relatively small, and the data is very large and very complicated. It is nearly impossible to over-fit on this data using a 3-layer neural network.

If the price was $500 and you had a trailing stop sell at $10, you would sell if the price moved to $490.

Even if you have a winning strategy somehow, emotions can still come to play. Not everybody can handle losing or winning thousands of dollars. When emotions come to play you make bad decisions.

I\'ll offer a few counterpoints for people to consider.\n\n> Trading is about having a clear idea, and sticking to it. Sounds easy, but is almost impossible. The market will fake left, dodge right... scare you into losing confidence in your original interpretation. \n\nThe key words here are in the first sentence. Have a clear idea before you even consider entering a trade.  Stick to that idea... until the news/data/information tells you otherwise.  Sticking to an investment idea is a good technique to employ, but don\'t become married to that idea in the face of new information that points a different direction.  When the facts change, so do my ideas and thoughts.  So be sure you have a clear idea when you\'re entering into a trade, and don\'t be afraid to stick to your guns until the data/news/information tells you differently.\n\n> Trading is straight gambling, and in that respect a slippery (addictive) slope.\n\nIf you\'re disciplined and you are trading on clear ideas, then I\'d say it\'s not "straight gambling".  However, if you\'re making trades every single day, then you\'re probably not trading on a clear idea (unless you\'re using some technical indicator on a really short time frame to trigger buys & sells).  You\'re trading on momentum and sentiment, and those are both emotional indicators.  You\'re gonna eventually get smoked doing that.  Stick with clear ideas and don\'t trade everything all the time.  Missing out is not even nearly as bad as executing a bad trade and getting your face ripped off.\n\n> 24/7/365 markets take their toll. Trading is stressful (exciting) and maddening.\n\nYou shouldn\'t be glued to the markets this much.  If you have a clear investment idea, then you won\'t be worried about minute by minute fluctuations. You\'re just putting yourself in a terrible place where you\'ll be influenced by your emotions if you pay attention to the market at all hours like a madman.  For me personally, there are days where I don\'t even check the price on my phone.  \n\nBuy and hold is a good long term option if you believe that Bitcoin will ultimately continue to rise in value as adoption rates increase.  However, if things start getting choppy and the value has run up to a level that you don\'t feel is sustainable, then don\'t be afraid to exit your position (or a portion of your position).  The important part is that you take the time to make the decision without emotional interference.  Once you\'re confident, pull the trigger, and don\'t second guess yourself five minutes later when the price doesn\'t respond the way you wanted.  Timing the market is nearly impossible.  All you can do is manage your own risk tolerance.  Ignore everyone else because they aren\'t investing your money.

I believe Paypal is going to attempt to establish itself as the leader in the US bitcoin market by creating a digital currency feature ala Coinbase/Circle.\n\nMost large companies would rather disintegrate slowly than radically reinvent themselves.  Look at Kodak, Blockbuster and all the retail stores that Amazon destroyed.  Paypal basically is never going to do what it takes to survive in a bitcoin-dominated payments business -- they're going to do everything they can to delay the new paradigm from happening.  First by ignoring it and pretending it's not a threat, then by lobbying congress to ban it.  Eventually, they'll just atrophy away.": 9, 'I have said this about Amazon, but the same thing applies to eBay/Paypal. They are to large, and bitcoin encroaches on their territory to much to simply integrate using Coinbase or Bitpay. If they are going to integrate, it will be using an in-house solution. With that being the case, these things take time. If they didnt start planning to develop something until September 2013, they would only be finishing the project and preparing to roll it out. That would also jibe with recent comments, as they grow eager to unleash their new product. \n\nI would see them starting with merchant acceptance. Allowing anyone who already has a Paypal account to accept bitcoin by simply checking a box on their account would keep them from losing sales to Coinbase/Bitpay, as it wouldnt be worth the development costs for merchants to go with another solution. If that was a success, they could go from there to enable bitcoin from within their digital wallet, and could go a step further by creating consumer protection or escrow tools. \n\nAs far as simply purchasing Bitpay or Coinbase, is it possible that neither was for sale?

Every day that passes strengthen the theory that the fundamentals of BTC are solid - at less than $9 there was little proof of that outside of a small fundamentalist enthusiast community and the Silk Road.

This makes the blockchain inherently more secure, more resilient, and more promising in the long term.\n\n\nPlenty of the smart money would rather take risky investments when they feel satisfied they understand the fundamentals.  The constantly growing blockchain size, transaction limits, massive numbers of altcoins showing some adoption as Bitcoin did a year or two ago, questions on the superiority of proof of stake, ring signature protocols all present important technical questions.  We've taken massive steps towards answering them in the past few years just by growing the community and applying band aids as needed, but even today the fundamentals are still murky both technically and financially/legally (regulations? money laundering laws? reporting requirements? property? ETFs?).\n\n\nExpect more and more big smart money to come in as the fundamentals are clarified further.

Amazon itself underwent a massive re-invention. When the site launched, they only sold physical print media. That is now a tiny percentage of their business operations.\n\nPayPal's directors may be many things - perhaps even many evil, reprehensible, and underhanded things - but they are not idiots. The wind is blowing in favor of bitcoin, and they know that it needs to be part of their business model.\n\nTransitioning to a coinbase-like model is not so much of a leap for PayPal, in purely business terms. They want to be the leader in online payment methods. They want their brand to be the online equivalent of those pictures of accepted credit cards you see on the doorways of brick & mortar stores. The technical nuts-and-bolts don't matter to them, except insofar as it limits their ability to monetize it.\n\nCoinbase has proven that they have a viable business model. PayPal can do the same thing, but is better equipped to reach a broader market - and they know they can handle the scale of doing so. Much of the technical functionality allowing that kind of thing is already part of PayPal's existing services, and they already have the necessary licenses across the board for financial services.\n\nI suspect the only thing that remains is code testing and nailing down the specific numbers to be both competitive and profitable.": 1, 'They don\'t want to incorporate bitcoin and educate people about a great alternative to their own payment system.

They are an infrastructure company with their cloud and payment services beyond their logistics. They also operate on thin margins. I can't imagine them using Coinbase instead of building something in house.

Sure, some of it may be a lack of tech savvy or vision, but PayPal is showing they have this and executives aren't ignorant. The reason is profits as I see it.

It's hard for them to do much other than fight Bitcoin and hope it goes away.": 3, '> Why would they repeatedly in national interviews talk about owning some? \n\nInvestors, shareholders, image, PR. Everyone has their eyes on PayPal when talking about Bitcoin, and they obviously are aware of this, they can\'t talk trash about Bitcoin if they want to keep a healthy image.\n\nNow, as for their plans, here\'s another theory which I believe more plausible: they are not building anything bitcoin. You see, they recognize the need to talk about Bitcoin to keep the media, shareholders, etc happy, but they also recognize the fact that, while it\'s a remarkable piece of software engineering that holds promise, it is also mainly used speculatively and the actual *demand* to transact and buy things with bitcoin is still very low (despite what /r/bitcoin would have you believe, buying things with a credit card online is still infinitely more convenient for the average computer illiterate Joe). \n\nSo, from a business point of view, it\'s risky. There\'s no "slice of the cake" up for grabs, but rather the opportunity to put the plate on the table and hope there\'s a cake eventually, that is to say, there\'s the opportunity for PayPal to position themselves as a first (big) mover, but at the expense of no immediate returns and uncertainty of whether it turns out profitable or not.\n\nSince PayPal is a company that we could consider within the realm of "big, old and hairy", my guess is that they are comfortable with their business as it is and are in no hurry to take risks. So, what do they do? They keep watching. They keep Bitcoin in their radar, keep observing how it develops, keep talking about how they\'ll totally have to integrate Bitcoin in the future, and, if someday it becomes obvious that there is a slice of the cake to grab, *then* they\'ll rush to accept bitcoin, buy Coinbase, etc. But by then they\'ll be late to the party and it won\'t matter.': 11, "I agree to a point, but - like most people - you have it backwards.
