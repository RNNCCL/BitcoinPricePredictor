I don't understand how bitcoin hedges against anything, aside from the belief that it does.\n\nI find that bitcoiners also often confuse monetary inflation with exchange rates. One difference between USD and BTC is that the USD has a large native economy of goods and services priced in USD, so changes in the exchange rate have much less impact on purchasing power than BTC, where essentially everything is priced in a foreign currency, so its exchange rate has a direct impact on purchasing power. Therefore, deflationary monetary policy actually matters very little in determining whether it's a good store of value (unless the goods you want to buy are priced in BTC, and nothing is - even drugs on darknet markets are priced in dollars).\n\ne: also, remember when people said that bitcoin would go up when the PBC announced that they were devaluing the Yuan?": 4, "The notion that bitcoin is a hedge on the dollar is an idea with no empirical backing. That being said, since bitcoin has predictable supply it can do well if it is substituted for a currency that is being significantly debased. There are many use cases where bitcoin can be substituted for dollars and for many businesses this substitution could be essentially instant, so in the case of a loss of confidence in a currency bitcoin seems like a likely safe haven. We haven't seen that with USD, and in fact in South America it pretty much has not happened. So there is good reason to believe that bitcoin might not work as a hedge on other currencies.\n\nUnfortunately only the course of history will actually decide this debate.

Speculators are bored with a complete lack of development in the ecosystem.

I think it\'s becoming clear that there\'s more going on than just a war of ideas.  This debate between BIP 100 and BIP 101 is corrupted by money.\n\nBoth sides in this debate are not behaving equally.  While there are  respectable people on both sides, it is unquestionable that more people on the BIP 100 side are acting unethically and, in some cases, criminally.  First, we have /u/theymos who has been discussed many times here before.  Second, there was the revelation that all five of the developers supporting bitcoin XT are employed by the same company, whereas Andresen, for example, is employed by a nonprofit.  Third, the legal threats against /u/gavin_andresen are not being returned equally.  Fourth, there are now criminal attacks targeted against bitcoin XT nodes that have forced some operators to shut them down; no such attacks are being directed at Core nodes.  Finally, BIP 100 itself allows a small group of miners to dictate network policy, which was never possible before.\n\nThe possibility should be considered that BIP 100 is a corporate takeover attempt.  Blockstream, which supports BIP 100, earns revenue by providing off-chain solutions.  BIP 100 allows a small number of miners to hold back block size to create artificial scarcity, increasing demand for Blockchain\'s services.  Even if /u/theymos and these miners are not being paid by Blockstream, the miners still gain increased power from BIP 100 they would not gain if no action were taken or if BIP 101 were adopted.\n\nIt seems to me that a stalemate will be reached.  BIP 100 is supported by a majority, but not a supermajority, of miners.  BIP 101 is supported by a majority of exchanges and economic interests because they don\'t want miners to be able to dictate terms to them.  Neither group can proceed without the other.\n\nOne thing that\'s interesting is that BIP 101 does not "time out."  If nothing happens, or if BIP 100 is adopted and then people start using bitcoin XT, the network can switch to BIP 101 (even unintentionally) at any time.  No matter what happens, BIP 101 will be around *indefinitely.*\n\nI think that others are seeing this uncertainty and getting out.

If an exchange website disappears suddenly, a user can simply go to another site that uses the same open source exchange software, or use another application that supports B&C Exchange and continue using the same account without interruption.

It will also be extended to allow for atomic cross coin swaps for many currencies/assets and many more will be added in the future. The team behind it is also working on a brand new pegging system that requires no extra margin like bitshares, even pays interest, and will allow for things like USD or gold to become a first class citizen on instantdex.\n\n> The "Instant" part comes from the fact that this is running a network of computers all participating in the supernetwork. This allows for the decentralized orders books to exist in a decentralized way across all machines that are instantly updatable and trades instantly clearable as they are matched. This is possible due to a complex p2p messaging protocol that underlies the core of the supernetwork, which also includes methods for extremely private coin transactions and messaging known as teleport and telepathy.

I will continue to invest in bitcoin via coinbase because I've been doing that for over a year. However, I suggest extreme caution when trading especially at high leverage.

Most importantly, they realize that they are involved in a business where people\'s lives (including theirs) change if they cannot make the business successful.\n\nThe Debian development team, for example, has extremely high standards for getting involved.  Even though the job is unpaid, developers are expected to maintain a contribution level, and there is stiff competition to become a developer.  People who report bugs to Debian are treated respectfully and when those in charge act inappropriately, they are removed.  As a result, Debian is one of the most widely used operating systems in the world.  In bitcoin, those in charge have lost legitimacy from the community through their own actions.\n\nThose in charge of bitcoin, and its auxiliary enterprises like forums and news sites, have not shown themselves to be responsible people.  Would you invest in a business whose CEO acts like some of the clowns we have "leading" this industry?': 8, "I'm pretty sure most of those people sold on Aug 24-25 during the fakedown either from losing faith in Bitcoin or hoping to buy back in cheaper.\n\nI'm not saying it can't possibly drop further, but if I was a betting man (and I am), most of the signs are leaning towards up at this point.": 5, ">Also you completely overstate the importance of Theymos given that there's a whole world of Bitcoin that is entirely Chinese that could not give a flying fuck who Theymos is, nor what Reddit thinks, nor what drama is going down on any of the English speaking forums.\n\n\nThe funny thing is that in the US many think the Chinese can be just wiped out from mining or markets, when the actual economic majority in BTC is Chinese speculators, not US bitcoin-as-a-paypal-alternative users.": 5, 'Who says most users disagree with BIP100?\n\nThere is a pretty vocal group of users behind XT, I understand their frustration with the stupid censoring etc. But the way they are trying to do things with a hostile hardfork doesn\'t inspire any confidence and the truth is that seeing the XT node count and blocks mined with 101 from the last 1000 we\'ve already seen how many people support it and I wouldn\'t call that "most users".\n\nWe will see, but we aren\'t going anywhere without the hashpower, that\'s the truth and I personally think the arguments against 100 are exaggerated and I do believe that most miners won\'t boycott their own source of revenue, but that\'s just my personal opinion and I don\'t care which one wins as long as this drama is over.': 1, 'I think a lot of these Bitcoin "figureheads," accidentally got very rich with the price jumps.

I\'m starting to consider whether people were wrong about the "decentralization" issue.  Is it possible that decentralization was tried, and it is being proven right now that it simply doesn\'t work because the system becomes centralized with evil people?\n\nIn a traditional system, there are regulations that aren\'t perfect, but they are enough of a hindrance that they prevent evil people from getting ahead in the world.  For example, there are few or no murderers running large corporations.  Most people who commit murder get away with it, but they usually live in fear and poverty because the system makes life difficult for them.\n\nThere is no system here to make life difficult for immoral people like /u/theymos.  He holds millions of dollars in donations and changed the CSS on his forums to essentially slander his enemies by making their posts appear as replies to the parent\'s parent, which could be a completely different context.  But there\'s no huge outcry over this.  There wasn\'t a huge exodus to another forum.  Despite his being rich enough to be an attractive target of litigation, nobody has even bothered to sue him over the missing donations.  Regardless of what the outcome is of this block size debate, it\'s possible that even people on the losing side will decide to forget what happened and go back to using his forums, allowing this to happen again with the next debate.\n\nMeanwhile, all the developers who are pushing the BIP 100 solution are corrupt, being on the payroll of one single company.  Nobody seems to notice or care about the implications of this.  There are continuous reddit posts being put out by people supporting these guys stating that Bitcoin XT "censors Tor nodes," which simply isn\'t true.  DDoS attackers target sites like XTnodes.com, causing the owner to shut down the site and transferring it to someone else.  Exchanges like Allcoin steal money we owe our customers and continue to operate.  Other exchanges steal far more money and disappear.  The majority of mining rig manufacturers don\'t deliver on time, have faulty hardware, or are bankrupt in class actions. \n\nThe only "salvation" to the bitcoin community that will raise price is OpenBazaar, which remains as vaporware after years of development.  They now say that they are on track for a release in less than 3 months - because they\'ve centralized their operations through a corporate sponsor.\n\nIt\'s time to start considering whether decentralization even works.  Bitcoin has been run mostly by bad people for six years now.  People have been saying that it\'s only a temporary thing, but what if we are wrong?  Is it possible that decentralized systems will never work because they are too vulnerable to evil people?  This is a serious question that needs to be discussed around here because it impacts whether we are investing in the right asset.  \n\nYou need good people to care in a decentralized system.  The bad people care a lot, but where are the reputable people?  Coinbase\'s CEOs aren\'t taking a stand against this behavior; they have little financial interest in doing so.  The lack of good people doing anything is what is killing this system.': 7, 'Say goodbye to the 230s': 0, "> xmr\n\nIf you're going with something like XMR, why not DASH or LTC as well?\n\nI don't know if I would allocate more than 15% to alts, personally but to each his own.": 1, 'Nobody is in charge of bitcoin.

That is pretty much a fact based on the popularity of merchant services that convert straight to fiat built around bitcoin.\n\nAs for the number of bitcoin sport bettors, you're right its just a estimate based on the top bitcoin gaming sites I browsed that actually show how many users are online, have chat rooms or progressive jackpots that grows with bets. The dice sites show every bet made.  Not that hard to do the math. I'd say about 500 regular sport bettors that spend at least 100 and a handful of whales every day is not a far off estimate and a few hundred poker players and dice players that pass through everyday. And  I'm sure some bettors keep bitcoin on hand to gamble with, but I doubt they risk money so they can just put it in cold storage for years hoping for a return.

I don\'t tell them to buy bitcoin because it\'s going to the moon, they are just well aware of the problems that typical offshore books have (slow processing, sketchy checks from sketchy banks). The speed of bitcoin and its "slow" confirmation times are a problem for some IRL businesses, but online sports-betting really lets it shine in comparison to its predecessors. \n\nIt has taken awhile for bitcoin-based sportsbooks to build up a bankroll/audience big enough to handle larger wagers, but a couple books have reached that point and it has really brought in some new blood.

Sure. \n\nSo yeah, aside from the thriving darknet markets and all the money tied to illegal substances, gambling is imho, a real driver of adoption. \n\n*edit\n\nGambling in general is getting a boost.

If 75% of blocks are indicating support a flag is set in all supporting nodes and a two week grace period begins. All nodes will be printing upgrade alerts to their logs. Miners, merchants and service providers then know to upgrade before the two week period elapses if they haven\'t already. Note that once the 75% threshold is reached the change is locked in and will occur after two weeks even if support dips back below 75%.\n\n>Once the fork occurs, nodes that are still following the 1mb-only chain will continue to receive and process transactions as before. However miners are incentivised to quickly switch to the larger chain as long as merchants, exchanges and other users do because otherwise their newly mined coins cannot be sold. Users are also incentivised to use the chain supported by the majority of mining hash power. Thus once the switch happens it is not likely that the 1mb-only side of the chain will continue for very long.\n\n># Does a hard fork cause Bitcoin to become two separate currencies?\nThe idea that people can speculate or dump coins on one side of the block chain is a common misconception. The Bitcoin protocol does not have a field for transactions to specify a chain, so ordinary transactions made just after the fork will be included in both assuming there is sufficient capacity on both sides.\n\n>Eventually, if both chains were to be in active use, newly mined coins would start to enter circulation and at that point transactions involving them would start to become valid on only one chain. Sending coins to someone on the other chain would have no effect if they use a fully validating node: they would simply never see the payment appear.\n\n>A situation where both chains are advancing simultaneously is not likely to last for long. After a hard fork with 75% of hashing power support the less supported side would be rapidly abandoned, as confirmation times on the 25% side would be much higher than normal. This in turn means the transaction backlog would get much larger until the next retargeting interval was reached, meaning a higher risk of double spending for people still on the weaker chain. Merchants and exchanges should therefore prefer the side with the most hashing power, and growth of Bitcoin is good for their businesses anyway. This would make coins mined on the 25% side after the fork unspendable with those traders, so also incentivising miners to rapidly switch to the main chain.\n\n>Because of this dynamic any actual disruption during the fork should be minimal, especially as the grace period means it will have been clear to everyone that the change is about to happen.': 7, 'aham... interesting... so, what happened? did they forgot a bottle of Tequila on the delete key or something?': 10, 'Yes, you might be right, on Bitfinex only.': 1, 'Who even had that many coins to sell on bitfinex?': 2, 'Lol me too!

The "block reward" is only necessary because no centralized entity controls or can reimburse miners - private chains can be secured by two home PCs that the entirety of the bitcoin mining network can\'t hassle and the revenue of operating that network *do not* need to come directly from the network. \n\nYou genuinely sound like you would benefit from thinking long and hard about the concepts of Bitcoin without the mindset of "There can be only Bitcoin", it allows for much more unbiased thought that will certainly help you grasp some of the concepts you\'re having trouble with here. \n\n\n': 3, '>Bitcoin exchange CEO Mark Karpeles manipulated data dozens of times: Report\n\nhttp://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/business/bitcoin-exchange-ceo-mark-karpeles-manipulated-data-dozens-of-times-report/articleshow/48327799.cms\n\nHe was buying enormous amounts simulating actual demand, a charade which obviously very quickly fell apart.

The two systems are out of sync. This should never happen in a margined trading platform, but it happens on Bitfinex.\n* Another closeout order is sent from the UI. The API goes through the same process as above. Because the position has not yet been updated, more than one market order is placed and a user who was short is now long and vice versa.\n\nIt appears it\'s even possible to combine this with severe UI/API lag and end up seesawing back and forth between a long and short position. Users get taken for a ride on the spread and fees.\n\nThe solution is to make the order execution engine and the position/margining engine completely synchronous with each other.  Any other solution is a hack, such as disabling the button after a single click, marking a field on the User record, and so on.\n\nIt makes sense that Finex would think that they fixed this issue (by allowing only one market order to be live at once), because it only manifests when the position/margining engine is severely overloaded. \n\nDon\'t get your hopes up for an easy fix.

I didn\'t want that post to turn into a bitfinex rant.\n\n>Is it not relevant to other traders that problems with finex are SERIOUS and affecting the community as a whole?\n\nI think everyone realizes that Bitfinex\'s problems are serious and affecting the larger marketplace over the past couple weeks.  Are you not paying attention to the comments in here today? There\'s a legion of people all ready to crucify bitfinex.\n\nHowever, bitfinex is not the sole cause for the movement in the price of bitcoin.  You can\'t blame everything that is happening with the price on Bitfinex issues.  You especially can\'t blame your trading losses on other exchanges on Bitfinex issues.  Your trades are your own responsibility.  Foisting the blame on bitfinex is a joke, in my opinion, especially because you trade on another exchange.  \n\n>Is it not relevant that a group may (be it known or unknown to finex) be using this situation to their advantage?\n\nSimply saying something doesn\'t make it true.  You\'re on the same train-of-thought as the people who come in here screaming "Manipulation!" every time the price drops unexpectedly.  Market action is market action, whether it\'s one single actor causing it or 10,000.\n\n>That\'s some XT style moderation there bud..\n\nNo, not really.  I\'m not removing everything bashing bitfinex, just things that really have no point and don\'t further the discussion.  A hundred different people saying "death to bitfinex" aren\'t really saying anything at all.  Also, had you posted your rant in the daily discussion, I wouldn\'t have removed it because the daily discussion is exactly the place for rants like that.  \n\n>Why i choose to use an alt is because maybe i don\'t feel like being targeted exactly like you\'re already doing.\n\nTargeted?  Who exactly would target you right now for ranting about Bitfinex?  No one is "out to get" bitfinex haters.  You\'re in the majority this week.\n\n>Other than the tongue in cheek "All that\'s left is to run with the coins" and "die already" i don\'t see anything that isn\'t actually completely relevant to a discussion about yet another finex problem.\n\nI agree, a lot of your rant wasn\'t irrelevant, it was simply in the wrong place.

Since then I've averaged that down a little, but expecting lower prices felt too greedy to me.  I don't regret entering when I did; my timeline is about 5 to 7 years, so lots of this just feels like noise.\n\nIf the price plummets and the experiment looks over, I'm not sure I'll sell.

But no, not real disbelief,  wanna know why?  I\'ve seen it before!  Used to happen alot back in the day actually..  Remember that?   Three letters, ends with "OX".   \n\nI am in no way saying that Bitfinex caused the downward volatility, and even you implying that i am trying to say that makes me question your integrity.. of course we all saw genuine downward volatility.  However the events of Aug 18th were definitely not all genuine.  \n\nI am saying, and have been saying consistently for each comment,  that the malfunction of the exchange caused things to happen that would have otherwise not happened.  Anyone acting reasonable and rational could look at the data and come to the same conclusion so don\'t try and treat me like a moron.  It is not only possible,  it is very likely. I mean, you can argue that "you can\'t prove that, blah blah, anything could have happened"  and sure you would be technically right,  but it does not mean that the probability of didn\'t go up like crazy due to the #1 exchange flopping around like a dead fish.  \n\nThings were actually rather calm elsewhere until bitfinex was already flipping out..

If so, this is devastating for a number of reasons.  I suspect that the emergence of BIP 100 is what caused yesterday\'s crash.\n\nBIP 100 proposes a "soft fork" mechanism where miners vote for block sizes.  If a certain percentage of miners vote for a new block size, then that becomes the new size, within certain restrictions.\n\nBIP 100 is inferior to BIP 101.  First, BIP 100 assumes that mining pools should be trusted with the power to decide on the block size.  Mining pools have an interest in keeping fees higher to the detriment of normal users.  Second, miners already can decide what block sizes they want to mine, but BIP 100 allows competitors to force changes upon other pools.  One pool may be fine with mining low-fee transactions for business reasons under BIP 101, and that wouldn\'t affect other pools.  But under BIP 100, the other pools could stifle the competition.  Finally, BIP 100 does not permanently resolve the problem; it still limits all blocks at 32MB with no ability to ever increase that limit.\n\nIf it is true that 25% of pools agree to BIP 100, then it is now unlikely that the transaction limit will ever be removed.  Given that most exchanges endorsed BIP 101 yesterday, there is no exchange support for BIP 100; even if miners adopt it, they will be creating a new coin that isn\'t traded anywhere.  Bitcoin will devolve into a long-term stalemate, which will cause price to decline further and further until it is either resolved or one of the coins without this simple problem takes over.\n\nNote that even if BIP 100 were to win, and exchanges were to support it, it doesn\'t actually resolve any real problem.  Technology improves so rapidly that the permanent BIP 100 cap will be hit very quickly and everyone will just be back to where they started.\n\nRemember, the only criteria for returning bitcoin to normalcy were that some solution be proposed, and that it permanently resolve the problem.  Bitcoin XT was inevitable yesterday, and now we\'re back to where we started - with a non-permanent solution that kicks the can down the road.  \n\nIf BIP 100 somehow gains support, would anyone want to own bitcoin given that everyone knows the price is going to crash when this happens AGAIN a few years from now?

The company also said former American Express Co. CEO and venture capitalist Jim Robinson III has joined its board.\n\nThe investment is the latest sign of Wall Street\xe2\x80\x99s about-face with Bitcoin, which banks and other financial firms initially said was unlikely to transform commerce. These financial companies don\xe2\x80\x99t have any interest in using the actual currency. But they see the \xe2\x80\x9cblockchain\xe2\x80\x9d technology that lets Bitcoin users instantaneously make and record transactions as a potential replacement for what they say is a cumbersome, costly and less-secure process.\n\nVast bureaucracies exist inside banks and at third-party firms to verify and process the buying and selling of everything from foreign currencies to stocks.\n\nThe blockchain is a record of every transaction ever made using Bitcoin. But rather than being held in a central database or institution, it is spread out over a network of independent computers and verified continuously by participants in the network instead of a central authority. Other blockchains have been created unrelated to Bitcoin.\n\nIts proponents say the technology might make it possible for a stock or other asset to change owners in the blink of an eye, instead of the roughly three days and several steps of intermediaries it takes now.\n\nWhile the technology is gaining popularity among many on Wall Street, it could take years before a critical mass of financial institutions agree to throw their weight behind a new protocol for processing and clearing transactions.\n\nThere are also questions about whether blockchains can be secure enough to handle a huge influx of sensitive transactions and how easily legacy financial institutions could start making such a radical change to the way they operate.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe believe in the power of blockchain technology to transform how financial assets are transferred, but it has to be done with the right partners to insure it gets off the ground,\xe2\x80\x9d said Adam Ludwin, CEO of Chain, in an interview.\n\nThe company is working with Nasdaq on using the technology to facilitate the trading of stakes in unlisted companies on its private market, but Nasdaq is able to set that up without cooperation from other institutions.\n\nTo change something bigger, such as how stocks or corporate bonds are transferred among investors, will require broad agreements from across the financial sector.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe devil is in the details,\xe2\x80\x9d said Houman Shadab, a law professor at New York Law School who studies blockchains. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of work to do in building a consensus on how to do it and migrating existing technologies onto a new and untested platform.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nChain is among a handful of startups vying to dominate the new field of blockchain technology for Wall Street. Other contenders are New York-based Digital Asset Holdings LLC, headed by former J.P. Morgan & Chase Co. executive Blythe Masters, and San Francisco-based Ripple Labs Inc.\n\nThe growing challenge in securely moving assets around the globe is reminiscent of another major event in the markets, the Paperwork Crisis of 1968, according to some industry experts.\n\nAt that time, transactions were settled with the delivery of physical certificates. But the volume of trading had risen so quickly that firms were awash in paper. The situation got so bad that the New York Stock Exchange had to reduce trading to four days a week.\n\nTo help solve the problem, brokers and exchanges helped create what is now called the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp., a central body that facilitates clearing and settlement for the financial markets. The DTCC says today it clears more than $1.6 quadrillion of transactions a year.\n\nMany of the processes at the heart of the financial system, including some at the DTCC, were built around how to automate paper-based transactions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose processes that came after the paperwork crisis were better, but there is a need now for a more elegant and better solution,\xe2\x80\x9d said Hans Morris, a former president of Visa who runs a financial technology investment firm Nyca Partners. Nyca has agreed to make an investment in another blockchain company called Clearmatics Technologies Ltd. in the U.K.\n\nRob Palatnick, chief technology architect of the DTCC, said the appeal of blockchain is its use of cryptography, which he says increases security of transactions and could streamline some of the legacy systems of Wall Street.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe technology does provide answers to some of the fundamental problems of the financial sector,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\n\nThe DTCC itself is exploring blockchain technologies and is planning to launch its first pilot project by the end of the year.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt feels like everything else in the world has gone digital, except money and assets,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mr. Ludwin of Chain. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s changing one way or another.\xe2\x80\x9d\n': 6, "A bitcoin future which settles 90 days from ~~now~~ this Friday.

So gold is simply not liquid enough. The amount of money out there is mindboggling. The US will be the only place big enough to hold it. Gold only benefits when the US finally goes down. You might say "Gold isn\'t liquid enough so the price will have to go up!" That\'s not how people think. If you had 50 billion dollars and you were scared and needed a place to put it, would you buy bitcoin (<4 billion dollar market cap)? No, you\'d buy gold. Well governments are in the same position.

Companies like Bitpay are realizing that very few people are using bitcoin for e-commerce. They can\'t hire and expand like they thought they could. \n\nSo this is kind of a back-to-the-drawing-board time in bitcoin\'s life. Bitcoin is software and we can change it, but first we have to admit that we\'re in trouble. We don\'t have a million users. I don\'t care how many accounts Coinbase says they have.

Holding a losing long position is inherently less risky than holding a losing short position. \n\nYou seem to be getting caught up on the issue of margin-calls and, it would appear, assuming that both are equally risky whether you are long on margin or short on margin. \n\nWhile this is true, being margin-called is not an exact science. It\'s not like you go long or short at $245 and you are margin-called at x dollar amount in either direction. Primarily, it depends on how much margin you are using and how much equity you have in your account to cover your position. \n\nLet\'s say I\'m 3x long at $300 on margin for 1 bitcoin. So my account equity is .33 BTC. If the price drops to approximately $200, I\'ll get margin-called. However, I can add more equity to my account at that point, let\'s say another .33 BTC to prevent myself from getting margin-called. Bitcoin has dropped 33% and I\'ve added 100% of my original balance to prevent myself from being margin-called. If bitcoin drops again to $100, I\'ll have to add another .33 BTC to my account to prevent another margin call. However, now my account equity is even with my margin long, so I cannot be margin called unless the price drops to $0. \n\nNow let\'s take the reverse scenario where I am short 3x margin at $300. I\'ve put down .33 BTC and the price jumps to $400. To avoid a margin call, I throw another .33 BTC into my account. Now it\'s at $500 and I throw another .33 BTC into my account again because I\'m stubborn and the price has to drop eventually right? Well now it\'s at $600 and I place another .33 BTC into my account to prevent another margin call. \n\nNow, unlike the person who went long, if the price keeps going up, I have to keep adding to my account to prevent future margin calls. While the person going long (even on 3x margin) can only lose the full amount of their original margin (in this case 1 bitcoin), the person going short can keep adding to their position and keep getting burned all the way up to infinite. \n': 6, "My example was an extreme use case to demonstrate the fact that shorting carries a hypothetical infinite potential loss whereas longing has a finite potential loss.\n\nObviously you'd be margin-called far before you lost anywhere near that much shorting on any exchange.\n\nEDIT: Although keep in mind, you absolutely could lose that much shorting at $245 if you were inclined to keep enough fiat in your account to cover such a loss.

It's not like you go long or short at $245 and you are margin-called at x dollar amount in either direction. Primarily, it depends on how much margin you are using and how much equity you have in your account to cover your position.\n\nWell yes, that makes it an exact science. Math, rather.\n\n> Let's say I'm 3x long at $300 on margin for 1 bitcoin. So my account equity is .33 BTC. If the price drops to approximately $200, I'll get margin-called. However, I can add more equity to my account at that point, let's say another .33 BTC to prevent myself from getting margin-called. Bitcoin has dropped 33% and I've added 100% of my original balance to prevent myself from being margin-called. If bitcoin drops again to $100, I'll have to add another .33 BTC to my account to prevent another margin call. However, now my account equity is even with my margin long, **so I cannot be margin called unless the price drops to $0**.\n\nNo, that's terribly incorrect. We agreed USD losses for shorts are potentially infinite, but conversely losses for longs *in terms of BTC* are likewise infinite. Consider:\n\n* You go long 3x at $300 with .33BTC collateral. This results in a swap taken out of $300.\n* Ignore the fine details of the [margin call equation](https://upload.wikimedia.org/math/2/6/9/269bff2d113f4e1774e2c29d46e86c3a.png). Main thing is on BFX maintenance margin is 15%. This means you have to keep at least 15% on top of whatever sum you borrow, in terms of total worth. In case of the $300 swap, your position (1 BTC) and underlying (.33BTC) need to be worth at least $300 + 15% = $345. \n* Interestingly, this means your margin call is at $258. Not quite close to $200. But let's say you added the other .33BTC to total collateral of .66BTC, your new liquidation point is $207. Whew, still not there :(.  \n* Now you add another .33BTC for total of 1 BTC collateral, seemingly equal to your 1BTC long position. However, your assertion that your account equity is even with your margin long is incorrect, you most certainly still can be margin called. That point btw, is now at $172.5. \n* What happens at $172.5 liquidation with your 1BTC collateral and 1BTC long position? Namely, 1.73BTC (1 from your margin position, 0.73 from your collateral) are sold for total of $300, to pay off your swap. The remaining .27BTC you keep. \n* How much BTC do you need as collateral to stand a drop to $100? 2.45 BTC. \n* Why do you keep having to add BTC? Well, simple reason being as price drops your BTC collateral is worth less and less.\n\n>Now let's take the reverse scenario where I am short 3x margin at $300. I've put down .33 BTC and the price jumps to $400. To avoid a margin call, I throw another .33 BTC into my account. Now it's at $500 and I throw another .33 BTC into my account again because I'm stubborn and the price has to drop eventually right? Well now it's at $600 and I place another .33 BTC into my account to prevent another margin call.\n> Now, unlike the person who went long, if the price keeps going up, I have to keep adding to my account to prevent future margin calls. While the person going long (even on 3x margin) can only lose the full amount of their original margin (in this case 1 bitcoin), the person going short can keep adding to their position and keep getting burned all the way up to infinite.\n\nWell, we agreed USD losses could be infinite, but it's a little amusing you're adding more collateral in BTC. Which actually, would mean your losses stop exactly when you add .66 BTC, which is exactly what you need to return your swap.

The paper says itself that they couldn\'t find any statistical significance of individual nation\'s stock index returns because the volatility of them makes the standard deviation high and thus it\'s much more difficult to find the result they want, i.e., rejecting that theres no effect of moon cycles (see page 14 where they concede this). Thus they were forced to turn to a larger pool of assets (MSCI index) which lowered the volatility of returns.\n\n2. The data is murky. They state they are using the MSCI global index, but they don\'t say how long of a time period, they dont report the sample sizes of the different panel regressions they run in the tables, and they don\'t control for economic fundamentals in any of their models that i can see.\n\n3. The conclusion is actually not that there is a correlation with volatility (see Table IX, they investigated and found no statistically significant relationship to volatility) as you said in earlier post, but that there\'s negative returns in the "full moon cycle" (see Table II, for whole index the avg return is statistically different from zero at least when compared to "new moon" period). \n\nIt\'s a funny study I guess but the results aren\'t robust when they have to cherrypick some huge index just to get their std dev down to get a stat sig parameter. \n\nIf i was a journal referee judging whether to accept this paper i would reject it just because it needs a lot of work.

He only said he hopes that the capitulation is a sign that we are near the bottom.  That\'s it.  No moon involved, not even close.  He was only hoping that we were near a bottom.\n\nIn markets, when traders "capitulate", it signals that the weak hands have been shaken out of the market.  With the weak hands out of the way, the people who actually have market power are free to move in and accumulate at the new amazingly low prices created by all the capitulation.  This drives the price back upwards as the market sees that a floor has been found, and then the weak hands begin returning to the marketplace to buy into the perceived rally, inevitably buying in again higher than they sold for during the capitulation phase.\n\nSo no, capitulation does not signal that the price of an asset is going to skyrocket iminently.  However, capitulation certainly can be a signal of a market reversal occuring.  A trader can easily profit from a market reversal if they have a sense it\'s coming before it happens.  Permabulls crying that they are "out for good, sold everything" is usually a pretty good sign of people capitulating.  Don\'t forget that we are traders here, not bitcoin permabulls.

As the db was stuck the number of connections continued to grow exceeding its limits. To fix this we had to restart the database, remove duplicate trades, import missing trades, and reconcile all positions/balances, update canceled and active orders, and try to rebuild the sequence of events as they happened. Following this, we went back to our old post-trade processing which fixed the issue. However, the issue isn\xe2\x80\x99t directly related to the new, faster, post-trade processing. We believe it lies with the database not being able to handle the load from the new system, however based on our tests this shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be an issue.

For example, you can create a /u/theymos resistant forum that nobody can censor, but you still need people to actually run the forum's servers.  Ethereum isn't powerful enough to host the forum's messages, only to validate that what you're seeing is correct.

This information is public knowledge, and as such, other traders will try to take advantage of it. So perhaps a bullwhale will see that guys like you are ready to sell because it was *"a pretty powerful blow for any future appreciation in the shorterm"*. He thus pushes the price up until you are tempted to get back in because *"now the market is showing strength."*... or maybe not... THIS part of the story is not public knowledge: Does the bullwhale exist? Is he a group of insiders? Does he own the f**ing exchange? What is he thinking? Will he succeed?\n\nThe mere fact that the price goes above or below some point is not enough for you to know what to do. If that public knowledge were a good indicator, then everyone would use it to their advantage and it would thus stop being a good indicator. So no, if we go below $200 for 3 days, 3 weeks, or 3 months, most of us will not know how to time the next big move.\n\nThis *might* be the end of the story in some markets, but in Bitcoin we have exchanges that are about as far from transparent as they can possibly get.
