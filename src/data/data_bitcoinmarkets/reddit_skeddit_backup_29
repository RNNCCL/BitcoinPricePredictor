At the current valuation, Mr. Ballmer would have to buy up around 3 million BTC or around 25% of the coins. That would be an imprudent thing to do. It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note however, that the technological benefits and efficiencies of Bitcoin should translate as well for the purchase of the LA Clippers as they do for the purchase of a cup of coffee. The market cap just isn\xe2\x80\x99t significant enough at the moment to accommodate for larger use cases. The same restraints are preventing a billion dollar company from raising funds through an equity offering on the Bitcoin blockchain or a million people from doing remittances on the same day. \n\nBut it\xe2\x80\x99s not the 21 million fixed supply of bitcoins that\xe2\x80\x99s restricting the possibilities.

Proof I have a transaction, and it was timestamped by another server on the other side of the world, and that you received it but didn\'t include it = failed block.

I\'m not sure if most people realize just how infinitesimally small a "big" number like $300bn is when it comes to economics. Or maybe most people are stuck with only looking at the US economy, or at gold, or company market caps, etc. \n\nThe fact is that the M2 money supply of the world economy (essentially, the money that needs to exist at any given time to cover all circulated bills and immediately accessible bank deposits) is ~$60 trillion. This is the absolute smallest amount of money that needs to exist in order for the world to continue running. And as large as that number is, it doesn\'t even include other forms of wealth such as stocks, bonds, real estate, etc. That number, called total wealth, is now close to $250 trillion (~$125tn of which is owned by the top 1%).\n\nBut despite these numbers everyone is still stuck on gold, or the market cap of Apple, or the number of internet transactions, or some other really useless statistic. I think we all believe that people will increasingly want to get their salaries in bitcoin, store their wealth in bitcoin, *and* transact in bitcoin. So why is everyone only looking at such a small picture? If bitcoin is truly going to disrupt the world economy (most people here hope for 10% penetration), then the number that needs to be looked at is global M2: $60 trillion. That "laughable" $300bn is 0.5% of $60tn. If bitcoin reaches a market cap of $300bn, as huge as that number seems, it means 99.5% of the world is still operating outside of bitcoin.

Eventually, the halvings take you smaller than 0.00000001 BTC and the reward is zero... unless we have increased the resolution in the protocol by then, which isn't impossible.\n\nHowever, being a [geometric progression](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_series#Sum) with a less than unity ratio, the total sum _is_ calculable, even if there were infinite precision.\n\n    S = a / (1-r)\n\nFor bitcoin, `r` is obviously 0.5, then we treat each halving period as one entry in the geometric progression, and lump all the rewards together for that block.  The halving is every 210,000 blocks and the initial reward was 50 BTC.  Hence:\n\n    S = (210000 * 50) / (1 - 0.5)\n      = 210000 * 50 * 2\n      = 21 million\n\nThis is the asymptotic value if the halving continued forever.  It doesn't, so we will never actually reach 21 million, but you should be able to see that since each halving period mines half the remaining coins, very quickly we reach the point were we're within a tiny percentage of 21M.\n\ni.e.\n\n    period[0] = 210000 * 50 = 10.5M\n    period[1] = 210000 * 25 = 5.25M\n    period[2] = 210000 * 12.5 = 2.625M\n    period[3] = 210000 * 6.25 = 1.3125M\n    period[4] = 210000 * 3.125 = 0.65625M\n    period[5] = 210000 * 1.5625= 0.328125M\n\nSo, after six halvings (approx 12 years I think), there will only be 328,125 BTC left to mine in the remaining infinity of time, or 1.5% of the total that will ever be mined.\n\nTo find out when we run out of resolution, we want to know when 50/2^n is less than 0.00000001.\n\n    0.00000001 = 50/2^n\n    2^n = log(50 / 0.00000001)\n    n = log(50 / 0.00000001) / log(2)\n      = 32.219\n\nSo, the 34th (`n` being zero-based) halving will halve the block reward to zero; which will in turn leave 210000*50/2^33 BTC of the 21M theoretical total, unminable.  i.e. 0.001222361 BTC, or 0.000000005821% of the 21M.\n\nHope that helps.\n": 3, "It's negative in the short term since there are much more bitcoins flooding in.

Individual miners are encouraged to add hashrate immediately and large miners are encouraged to wait to release hashrate.

First, we examine competition between different currencies, focusing on Bitcoin, Litecoin, Peercoin and Namecoin. Second, we look at competition among the exchanges where those currencies are traded. In both these environments network effects play an important role.\nWe divide our data into two periods: May\xe2\x80\x93September 2013 and October 2013\xe2\x80\x93February 2014. In the first period, Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s price was relatively stable, while in the second period it was very volatile.\n\n\n> We find that in the first period, Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s popularity (as measured by exchange rates) increased against the USD and other cryptocurrencies. But in the second period, the prices of other cryptocurrencies increased even more against the USD than Bitcoin did. In our interpretation of these results, it seems that on the one hand Bitcoin, via its initial popularity, \xe2\x80\x9copened up\xe2\x80\x9d the market for cryptocurrencies in general. At the same time, it enjoys a first- mover advantage in an environment with network effects. In the long term, it is not clear whether this advantage will be sufficient to keep the dominant position.

": 0, "None of the responses below are actually 100% correct.\n\n1) An ETF is a *passively* managed investment vehicle that trades on an exchange tracks a benchmark. This benchmark is often a basket of stocks (index) but can be pretty much anything you can trade. In this case the benchmark will be Bitcoins.\n\nETFs are very useful because they allow investors to get exposure to a specific security or set of securities that would normally be difficult of costly to buy. In the standard case of a stock index, it is very expensive to buy the entire S&P500 - it would cost thousands and thousands of dollars. However with an ETF I can easily buy shares that give me exposure to those stocks without requiring to actually hold the shares.\n\n\n2) As mentioned before ETFs are passively managed. *No one* on the ETF side is actually going out and actively buying and selling bitcoins to get the price to track. Because eht ETF trades on an exchange, the price of the shares floats with supply and demand. So instead of having portfolio managers try to manipulate the funds holdings to meet a certain price target, ETFs leverage the market (and the profit seeking nature of traders) to ensure their vehicle tracks their index.\n\nTo accomplish this, ETFs generally support a mechanism by which a trader can buy a bundle of the underlying asset and exchange it for shares of the fund. If, for example, each share of the ETF represent .1 bitcoin (meaning the ETF currently trades around ~$60 per share), a trader could buy up 1000 bitcoins and exchange them for 10,000 shares. Why would they do this? Well if the shares of the ETF are (for whatever reason) trading at a premium to Bitcoin a savy trader could make a risk free profit buy buying relatively cheap coins, exchanging them for shares, and selling off the relatively expensive shares. \n\nConsider our example. Bitcoin trades at $600 and the ETF trades at $70 with each share representing .1 bitcoin. In this scenario a trader can buy 1000 Bitcoins for $600k, exchange for 10,000 shares of the ETF and sell those shares for $700k, netting a profit of 100k. This trade will push up the price of bitcoin while pushing down the price of the ETF. Because traders are profit seeking this trade will be performed until no additional profit can be made - i.e.: the price of the ETF is roughly the same as Bitcoin.\n\nNow obviously the opposite trade can be done if the ETF is cheap vs the price of Bitcoin.\n\n3)  Say I'm your run of the mill investor. I'm interested in Bitcoin as an investment but I don't know anything about wallets, blockchains, cold storage, computer security, etc. All that stuff is simply a barrier to entry for me to invest. This ETF abstracts all that stuff away. By buying the ETF a portion of my portfolio will now track the price of Bitcoin without requiring me to actually do any of the annoying stuff that actually owning bitcoin entails.\n\nIs it superior to buying bitcoin directly?

As per every commodity in history, this means price will trickle down slowly if there is no new demand, as, over time, it becomes cheaper to mine due to improvements in technology\n\nBitcoin has cost/price relations that are decidedly atypical.  While marginal cost and price will equilibrate, this is misleading as, in the case of bitcoin, difficulty adjustments mean that supply and marginal cost are only very loosely related.\n\nIf price drops, then some miners have to turn off their rigs, difficulty drops and, after difficulty adjusts, the exact same amount of bitcoin is still mined. The reverse process happens if price rises (assuming some rigs are always turned off) or technology improves or whatever. Supply conditions don't affect supply; in both cases, once difficulty adjusts, supply is unchanged. Since this is not the case for most commodities, comparing bitcoin to ordinary commodities can be dangerously misleading.\n\nIt also means that, while, as with all prices, bitcoin price reflects the relation between supply/demand, the cost of mining has (once difficulty adjusts) nothing to do with supply, and hence price. \n\nTL;DR: If the marginal cost/supply link is broken (as with bitcoin), then the marginal cost/price link is similarly broken.\n": 2, 'If you are an engineer / scientist, you tend to view commodities as "things necessary for constructing physical infrastructure and industrial production".

After all, we would then have a new trend line that spans from 2010 to 2014 instead of just 2013, so it's even more significant. And all that changes is its slope, by a few percent. And in hindsight, had you drawn that line at certain earlier points in time, it would have been broken several times already. Why were these not equally devastating events (again, in hindsight)?": 3, 'I still don\'t agree with you:\n\nFirst of all, yes, bubbles in price will usually go hand in hand with surges in adoption. But why should this be an argument to think that breaking some trend line at some point in time must go hand in hand with a fundamental change in adoption rate? This is just some assumption you\'re making, and it is very far fetched. I am making the counter-assumption that adoption happens largely independent of price, and is only temporarily influenced by big movements in price. This woukd be in line with an S curve model of adoption and a price that is wildly fluctuating around that curve.\n\nAlso, why is the perceived lower boundary of the price trend of such importance to anything in the first place. Obviously the "real trend" (if there even is such a thing) should be the best fitting line that goes somewhere in between all the price fluctuations. A lowered lower boundary trend line only indicates that there seems to be more long term volatility than anticipated before, nothing more.': 2, "I combined this line with the one you found yesterday [modified by TGDE](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2ccm0q/daily_discussion_friday_august_01_2014_part_2/cje8j81) to get [this triangle (imgur link)](http://i.imgur.com/b5QU65Y.png).

Of course, that depends partly on whether, as you mentioned, we are still experiencing exponential growth.": 5, "> but breaking that trend line would be a pretty bad sign\n\nSorry if this is a a stupid question, but why would that be a bad sign? Wouldn't that simply mean that the trend line needs to be adjusted a bit? I mean nothing fundamentally changes just because a line on a chart gets broken, right? It's still the same Bitcoin, we then just have more market data to draw conclusions from.": 3, 'Yes, that\'s true. In the event that it happened, it\'s likely that we would just end up on a slightly lower trend line again, as happened (apparently) in 2013. But that in itself - being on a shallower growth trend - would be a big deal. Again, I\'m not saying that this would herald btc\'s death or something, just that it would likely be indicative of a major change in the market, in a less bullish direction. This happening for the second time - and just one year after the first - would also be a big deal, rather than just indicating a one-time correction back to the "true" trend line.\n\nThe S curve theory doesn\'t really allow for step-wise slowing every few years. It\'s basically slow launch, exponential growth, then slow topping out. So if the true trend is slightly flatter every few years, that\'s not an S curve, or it means we\'re already at the top. The former isn\'t a bad result, just different than many have been arguing (S curve v no S curve), while the latter would be just flat bad. (I don\'t think btc adoption is topping out, FWIW. IMO it\'s more likely that the S curve would get thrown out, if indeed we stop following the exponential growth trend. In the meantime that could mean a major bear market, though.)': 2, "But the S curve model should be applied to the adoption of Bitcoin as a technology, and not to its price. It's obviously safe to assume that price will follow a similar curve over the long term, but there will just as obviously be very significant discrepancies between adoption and price along the way, especially while the price is still almost entirely defined by the whims of a small group of speculators.\n\nI think it is extremely fallacious to think that a momentary change in the trend line of the price has any kind of significant correlation to some hypothetical change in the fundamentals on which the assumption of an S curve adoption model are based.\n\nOr to put it more straight forward: Why should speculators in a still fairly shallow market be able to change the fundamentals of a technology just by selling or buying some bitcoins? It makes absolutely no sense to me.": 2, "That is true to a certain extent, but this trend line is drawn from a point in 2010 through another point in 2013. That means that btc has been on/above that line for four years now, and basically for all of its trading history. Breaking a trend that's almost as old as the unit itself would be pretty huge, and a huge bearish sign if the break is significant. It would mean a shift in what we can expect it to be worth in the near future. It could also mean that we're already capping out in adoption, rendering the S curve theory null, or at best inaccurate.\n\nIt wouldn't be the end of the btc world, but it would be a bigger deal than it breaking all of its other trend lines recently.": 3, "> Or to put it more straight forward: Why should speculators in a still fairly shallow market be able to change the fundamentals of a technology just by selling or buying some bitcoins?\n\nThey can't change the fundamentals of the coin, but they can change the price. And changes in the price can change the adoption rate. This is how bubbles work, in fact: Large changes in price make people take notice, who then buy, resulting in further increases, etc. The same is true for normal price changes, just less extreme. When the market is bearish fewer people want to buy in, save for those who already know about the tech and believe in it. New money, however, stays away FTMP.\n\nBitcoins need to be bought by more people in order for the tech itself to be adopted. The market is part and parcel with the adoption of the idea (well, unless some other coin starts being adopted in lieu of btc).\n\nWhether discrepancies on the short time frame end up mattering I think will depend on how big they are. If it's just a single day where the price is $5 lower than the magical line then I agree, it's not important. But if we go a few weeks with the price stuck well under that line I think that would indicate that the market is moving slower - less bullishly - than it had been before, and that will have an effect on adoption. I'm pointing it out now as just something to watch. I have no idea what will happen here, though the fact that the price has blown through two other seemingly important exponential trend lines in the last couple months certainly has me taking notice.\n\nI'm heading to bed so I'll check this in the morning.

It could also be described as a situation in which asset prices appear to be based on implausible or inconsistent views about the future. \n\n>Because it is often difficult to observe [intrinsic values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_value_(finance\\)) in real-life markets, bubbles are often conclusively identified only in retrospect, when a sudden drop in prices appears. Such a drop is known as a *[crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset_price_crash)* or a *bubble burst*. Both the [boom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_boom) and the [burst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recession) phases of the bubble are examples of a [positive feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback) mechanism, in contrast to the [negative feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback) mechanism that determines the [equilibrium price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equilibrium_price) under normal market circumstances. Prices in an economic bubble can fluctuate erratically, and become impossible to predict from supply and demand alone.\n\n>While some economists deny that bubbles occur,  [*[page\xc2\xa0needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citing_sources)*] the cause of bubbles remains disputed by those who are convinced that asset prices often deviate strongly from intrinsic values. Many explanations have been suggested, and research has recently shown that bubbles may appear even without [uncertainty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty),  [speculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation),  or [bounded rationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality).  In such cases, the bubbles may be argued to be rational, where investors at every point fully compensated for the possibility that the bubble might collapse by higher returns. These approaches require that the timing of the bubble collapse can only be forecast probabilistically and the bubble process is often modelled using a Markov switching model.   It has also been suggested that bubbles might ultimately be caused by processes of price coordination  or emerging social norms. \n\n>\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Economic ^bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_bubble) ^| [^Dot-com ^bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble) ^| [^Speculation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speculation) ^| [^Stock ^market ^bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_bubble) ^| [^Tulip ^mania](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulip_mania) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cjhyuzf) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cjhyuzf)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)': 1, "Because some connections in a network are more valuable than others, putting a measure to them differs between analyse.

He was an insider to the British contingent, had inside information. And while the settlement was favorable to the market, he returned tight lipped and sold. Panic ensued. And then he began to buy. In that day he ruined many a noble house in London, and accumulated great wealth for his own. The rest is history in the modern anglo american banking Cabal.\n\nThis should not be a mystery. This is how bankers and tax collectors behave thoughout history. They are a signifigant source of human suffering, once they lose touch wirh  serving the common good and move to aggrandize themselves with wealth and power.\n\nIMO the New Testament is an existential struggle of humankind versus the Cabal. Jesus threw the tax collectors out of the Synogoge. And then he simplified a Byzantine code of morals which only the most elite had the resources with which to follow. He condensed it to two primary purposes; 1) Love your god, and 2) Love your brother as you would love your god.\n\nHence the verse from Revalations is appropo. Look not for the sign that Wall Street decided not to show up, they are already here, rather look for the sign as to when they achieve supremacy.

So for example, a normal exchange will display the full order book ie current price and at different bid/ask levels you can see order blocks etc.  All that information is hidden in dark pools, but trades are still made via a matching engine.  ": -1, 'A private exchange essentially, one not available to the public.': 1, '[deleted]': 7, 'So do the orders appear in the order book, or are they invisible? Do they appear only once the trade is registered? ': 1, 'From investopedia:\n\nDark pools are an ominous-sounding term for private exchanges or forums for trading securities; unlike stock exchanges, dark pools are not accessible by the investing public. Also known as \xe2\x80\x9cdark pools of liquidity,\xe2\x80\x9d they are so named for their complete lack of transparency. Dark pools came about primarily to facilitate block trading by institutional investors, who did not wish to impact the markets with their large orders and consequently obtain adverse prices for their trades. While dark pools have been cast in a very unfavorable light in Michael Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 bestseller \xe2\x80\x9cFlash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,\xe2\x80\x9d the reality is that they do serve a purpose. However, their lack of transparency makes them vulnerable to potential conflicts of interest by their owners and predatory trading practices by some high-frequency traders. (See also "How IEX is Combating Predatory Types of High-Frequency Trades.")\n\nRationale for dark pools \n\nThe current controversy surrounding dark pools may lead one to think that they are a recent innovation, but they have actually been around since the late 1980s. Non-exchange trading in the U.S. has surged in recent years, accounting for about 40% of all U.S. stock trades in 2014 compared with 16% six years ago. Dark pools have been at the forefront of this trend towards off-exchange trading, accounting for 15% of U.S. volume as of 2014, according to figures given by industry insiders.\n\nWhy did dark pools come into existence? Consider the options available to a large institutional investor who wanted to sell 1 million shares of XYZ stock prior to the advent of non-exchange trading. This investor could either (a) work the order through a floor trader over the course of a day or two and hope for a decent VWAP (volume weighted average price); (b) split the order up into say five pieces and sell 200,000 shares per day, or (c) sell small amounts until a large buyer could be found who was willing to take up the full amount of the remaining shares. The market impact of a 1-million sale of XYZ shares could still be sizeable, regardless of whether the investor chose (a), (b), or (c), since it was not possible to keep the identity or intention of the investor secret in a stock exchange transaction. With options (b) and (c), the risk of a decline in the period while the investor was waiting to sell the remaining shares was also significant. Dark pools were one solution to these issues.\n\nWhy Use a Dark Pool?\n\nContrast this with the present-day situation, in which an institutional investor uses a dark pool to sell a 1 million share block. The lack of transparency actually works in the institutional investor\xe2\x80\x99s favor, since it may result in a better realized price than if the sale was executed on an exchange. Note that as dark pool participants do not disclose their trading intention to the exchange prior to execution, there is no order book visible to the public. Trade execution details are only released to the consolidated tape after a delay.\n\nThe institutional seller has a better chance of getting a buyer for the full share block in a dark pool, since it is a forum dedicated to large investors. The possibility of price improvement also exists if the mid-point of the quoted bid and ask price is used for the transaction. Of course, this assumes that there is no information leakage of the investor\xe2\x80\x99s proposed sale, and that the dark pool is not vulnerable to high-frequency trading (HFT) predators who could engage in front-running once they get a whiff of the investor\xe2\x80\x99s trading intentions.\n\nTypes of dark pools \n\nAs of April 2014, there were 45 dark pools in the U.S., consisting of the following three types:\n\nBroker-dealer owned: These dark pools are set up by large broker-dealers for their clients, and may also include their own proprietary traders. These dark pools derive their own prices from order flow, so there is an element of price discovery. Examples of such dark pools, of which there were 19 as of April 2014, include Credit Suisse\xe2\x80\x99s CrossFinder, Goldman Sachs\xe2\x80\x99 Sigma X, Citi\xe2\x80\x99s Citi Match and Citi Cross, and Morgan Stanley\xe2\x80\x99s MS Pool.\nAgency broker or exchange-owned: These are dark pools that act as agents, not as principals. As prices are derived from exchanges \xe2\x80\x93 such as the midpoint of the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO), there is no price discovery. Examples of agency broker dark pools include Instinet, Liquidnet, and ITG Posit, while exchange-owned dark pools include those offered by BATS Trading and NYSE Euronext.\nElectronic market makers: These are dark pools offered by independent operators like Getco and Knight, who operate as principals for their own account. Like the broker-dealer owned dark pools, their transaction prices are not calculated from the NBBO, so there is price discovery.\nPros and Cons\n\nThe advantages of dark pools are as follows \xe2\x80\x93\n\nReduced market impact: As noted earlier, the biggest advantage of dark pools is that market impact is significantly reduced for large orders.\nLower transaction costs: Transaction costs may be lower, since dark pool trades do not have to pay exchange fees, while transactions based on the bid-ask mid-point do not incur the full spread.\nDark pools have the following drawbacks \xe2\x80\x93\n\nExchange prices may not reflect the real market: If the amount of trading in dark pools owned by broker-dealers and electronic market makers continues to grow, stock prices on exchanges may not reflect the actual market. For example, if a well-regarded mutual fund owns 20% of company RST\xe2\x80\x99s stock and sells it off in a dark pool, the sale of the stake may fetch the fund a good price, but unwary investors who have just bought RST shares will have paid too much for it, since the stock could well collapse once the fund\xe2\x80\x99s sale becomes public knowledge.\nPool participants may not get the best price: The lack of transparency in dark pools can also work again a pool participant, since there is no guarantee that the institution\xe2\x80\x99s trade was executed at the best price. Lewis points out in \xe2\x80\x9cFlash Boys\xe2\x80\x9d that a surprisingly large proportion of broker-dealer\xe2\x80\x99s dark pool trades get executed within the pools \xe2\x80\x93 a process known as internalization \xe2\x80\x93 even in cases where the broker-dealer has a small share of the U.S. market. As Lewis notes, the dark pool\xe2\x80\x99s opaqueness can also give rise to conflicts of interest if a broker-dealer\xe2\x80\x99s proprietary traders trade against pool clients, or if the broker-dealer sells special access to the dark pool to HFT firms.\nVulnerability to predatory trading by HFTs: The recent controversy over dark pools has been spurred by Lewis\xe2\x80\x99 claims that dark pool client orders are ideal fodder for predatory trading practices by some HFT firms, which employ tactics such as \xe2\x80\x9cpinging\xe2\x80\x9d dark pools to unearth large hidden orders, and then engage in front running or latency arbitrage.\nSmall average trade size reduces need for dark pools: Somewhat surprisingly, the average trade size in dark pools has declined to only about 200 shares, Exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), who are seeking to stem their loss of trading market-share to dark pools and alternative trading systems, claim that this small trade size makes the case for dark pools less than compelling.\nCurb appeal \n\nThe recent HFT controversy has drawn significant regulatory attention to dark pools. Regulators have generally viewed dark pools with suspicion because of their lack of transparency, and the controversy may lead to renewed efforts to curb their appeal. One measure which may help exchanges reclaim market share from dark pools and other off-exchange venues could be a pilot proposal from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to introduce a \xe2\x80\x9ctrade-at\xe2\x80\x9d rule. The rule would require brokerages to send client trades to exchanges rather than dark pools, unless they can execute the trades at a meaningfully better price than that available in the public market. If implemented, this rule could present a serious challenge to the long-term viability of dark pools.\n\nBottom Line\n\nDark pools provide pricing and cost advantages to buy-side institutions such as mutual funds and pension funds, and these benefits ultimately accrue to the retail investors who own these funds. However, dark pools\xe2\x80\x99 lack of transparency makes them susceptible to conflicts of interest by their owners and predatory trading practices by HFT firms. The recent HFT controversy has drawn increasing regulatory attention to dark pools, and implementation of the proposed \xe2\x80\x9ctrade-at\xe2\x80\x9d rule could pose a threat to their long-term viability.\n\nSource: http://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets/050614/introduction-dark-pools.asp': 1, "Barry Silbert himself runs a Bitcoin dark pool, honestly I don't know where you're getting this from.": 1, "We can't.

I note the following paragraph on page 27:\n\n*Difficulty increases have been fairly consistent over the past year, with typical fortnightly hashrate increases of between 10 and 20% (BitcoinWisdom, 2014). Because of this, the useful life of most mining equipment is only about 3 to 6 months.*\n\n*Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)\nTheoretically, breaking the 130,000,000 GH/s hashrate down into equivalent network-average ASIC units at a CAPEX cost of $2.63/GH results in a one-off CAPEX of $343.3 million. Assuming this has to be spent twice a year (due to difficulty increases), CAPEX of around $684.6 million needs to be invested in the network every year. At the current block reward of 25 Bitcoins per 10 minutes, roughly 1,314,000 Bitcoins are mined per year. This equates to yearly CAPEX of $684.6 million / 1.3140 million Bitcoins = $521 / Bitcoin.*\n\nThe more I read your posts, the more I am certain that you have not read a word of the research paper.\n\nAlso, seriously, $1900 per coin? Look in your heart of hearts. On what planet would a commodity sell for less than a third of the cost to mine it?\n': 6, 'I think it all just clicked:  \n\n1- The reason that the numbers you get out of the calculator with a 0% difficulty increase are the same as mine, is because my model is a screenshot of the current second in time. To that end, there is no future to factor difficulty in to. It\'s what the cost to mine a bitcoin is right this second, considering average network power consumption, and how much money has been spent on the mining rigs currently churning out hashes. No guesses as to what the future will bring are made (except the guess that difficulty increases will make mining prohibitive in 6 months\' time - this could be more, could be less, but based on the average 15% fortnightly number, 6 months is about right +/-5%). There is no lead time, shipping risk, and all that other stuff. It\'s what it costs right. this. second. Whatever machines are on right now, churn bitcoin out at an average cost of somewhere around the current price +/- 5% (I haven\'t looked at the specific numbers for today, but $588 is pretty much bang-on for a hash rate of 133,000,000)  \n\nYou are right however, there are indeed guesses made in the model. The guesses that are made are the composition of the broad average mining network, which are guesses based on the law of perfect competition, and proxy data from a bloody good proxy in Cex.io / GHash.io - 20% and 40% of the mining industry respectively (I do understand that they are an overlapping set). This is probably accurate to +/-5% considering the volume of proxy data we have to rely on.  \n\n2- The reason that difficulty is eventually accounted for in the CAPEX figures, is because due to exponentially increasing difficulty, ASICs become useless after 6 months. Hence, if you were to divide the entire network hash rate by the "assumed average equivalent miner", you will get a CAPEX number that you will need to multiply by 2, as you need to spend this CAPEX amount, on average, twice per year due to the average difficulty increases that make difficulty jump by 100% every 6 months.  \n\nI think the main point of confusion was that you may have interpreted the model as forward looking (which I also agree with you, it is impossible to look into the future), where as I view it as an instantaneous screenshot of it. This may or may not be the reason why on 14 days out of 14, the model has shown to be accurate., and based on my belief, will be perpetually accurate.  \n\nI won\'t be posting daily any more due to the amount of confusion over my model and its assumptions (even though they have been made 100% clear in my research paper). It is now popular opinion that the analysis is "bunk". I may post an update at every difficulty change, so that the people who do believe in the model can see how it\'s tracking.

In hindsight, there is room for improvement. \n\nSwaps analysis: looks like the long side is stabilizing at just under $30M. And the shorts are stacking up, now at just over 5k BTC.

Target $710. Its a 2:1 risk reward sandwiched between the low from the post May up move and the high from the post Mt gox pump and dump. Its a small position size due to the wide swing. The trade into BTC exposes the trader to some upside without paying theta on the margin. \n\nI am willing to short BTC on a breakdown at $560.

Just exactly what do you classify as a bubble? And do others also classify it the same way?\n\nI compare our most recent rise to 680 to the Jan 2012 "bubble." In both instances, there was a rapid recovery from a very prolonged bear market. In both instances, there has been a deteriorating of the price but still far from the bear market lows. These recoveries were fueled by all the cash waiting on the sidelines, waiting for the bear trend to end, arguably by players already in the bitcoin space and not fueled by new money or the euphoria provided from the "this is it!" reckless mindset the bubble provides.\n\nThe problem with looking back pre-2013 is: \nBitcoin was much more volatile back then. It makes sense - It was very cheap, much fewer players, etc. It was much easier for it to go up a much higher %. Also, there were 7200 bitcoins mined a day, which undoubtedly affects the market. That said, I think any data that is pre-2013 is a very poor indicator to look to when trying to look forward. Personally, I think 2014 is going to be another 2012 with a possible bubble towards the end of the year...but we\'ll see.

Thats right. I dont manage my trades til they hit their target. This is my approach to swing trading. I have rules for trades. I setup rules to enter and exit. And I stick to them. It minimizes my emotional impulses (which are about as good as /u/btcidiotdude) It leverages my TA skill and it takes advantage of statistics (Expectancy theory). \n\nBased on my TA, I can identify a 2:1 risk reward trade according to SET (stop, entry, target).  TA begins with trading with Trend (i use daily ADX to confirm trend exists). On TA I seek entries at high bases (bull) low base (bear), pull backs (buy the dip/sell the blip), and symetric triangles. I put stops at any reasonable level of support/resistance (the 20/50 DMA\'s r common) but it could also be a level where price action/volume leaves a marker on the chart. (For example $560, or $607 or 685)\n\nNow, a target is not a target if you close the trade prior to achieving it. Over many trades, closing early will statistically impair your SET expectancy. This means, my 2:1 risk reward will be actually be less.\n\nUpon hitting target, I take off half my position, letting the other half run. I call these target profits, "risk covers", because these offset my losses on trades which stop out for max loss (risks). I have a 55% target achievement or w/l ratio. Where I take half off and the other half runs.\n\nThis sets up a story problem where losses before runners is 45%*R-55%*(1/2)R=17.5%R. On 10 trades this is 1.75R which I gotta make up on my 5.5 runners. Usually one of my runners hits 5R or more. Call that a home run (from baseball). The others are usually ho hum but are enough to cover my 1.75R, call those singles n doubles.\n\nOn target achievement, I move the stop up to trade entry. Then I actively manage the trade dynamically. In the morning, I move the stop up to yesterdays low (bulls) down to yesterdays high (bears). Once the stop meets target, I switch to trailing stop at 1/2 daily ATR. Im also messing with the daily 2/5 EMA cross.\n\nIts a rush to be in a home run runner. ;-) But I dont expect them every trade.  I only need 3 to 4 annually to achieve my return on Capital goal, 30%. Given R is 2% of capital. And given HR runners hit minimum 5R. 3.5*5(2%=R)=35%.\n\nThis is this jist of my trade plan. I\'m playing for the home run every once in a while (like Ichiro, I dont expect the HR, I dont get mad if I dont hit one, I dont care if I get stopped out) ; meanwhile its critical I trade my plan to cover the risk of being in the market, and monitor that my TA is achieving 5 to 6 targets out of 10 trades.\n\nThank you for your question, I hope my answer helped.

However, since those people might be like the "most people" you describe and feel that way at the moment, be mid-term or long-term bears/bulls, or have other motivations, it\'s usually simpler for the sake of argument to just lump them into either group and focus the argument on the points you are trying to make in relation to the two.

There's nothing wrong with your argument related to mv. However, it does contain some problematic ideas and conclusions.\n\n* You're comparing currency to holding jobs. If you have a job that equates to currency moving. If you don't, that's saved up currency. This is a deeply flawed perspective of things. First of all, currency is always unproductive. It does nothing on its own. Secondly, currency is always held by somebody. It doesn't vanish when it moves. Thirdly, money is stored up economic energy, in that, it has worth. Being without a job has approximately worth zero. This analogy you introduced is deeply flawed.\n* You're assuming most people will keep a small balance, and hence MV would be big. This too, is a flawed assumption. It's true that a large portion of the US population does not hold much funds, however, that's got more to do with an inflationary system, one that punishes savers, and rewards debtors. For much of history, saving money and prudent use of your personal resources has been lauded as a virtue. A system that's inherently deflationary, will reward savers, and so, people will hold larger balances.\n* You're also assuming that the impact of MV would be large. This can be disputed. It will certainly have a short-term impact. But the store of value characteristic rules the valuation over the long term (it's recognized that the prevailing determining factor in the valuation of a currency is the quantitative theory of money, even though this may not hold sway over short periods).\n* Another way to look at the flaw in seeing MVs impact as large, is the fact that of every currency in use on the world, only about 5% (at best) are in circulation (btw. this mirrors bitcoins money velocity quite well).

Wouldn\'t that be a more "stable, value driven price" than the $100 price point?\n\nQuestions like this are why we are at $600 now and why some think that the "stable, true" price of bitcoin hasn\'t actually been reached yet, and is actually in the tens of thousands.\n\nI have my doubts if we\'ll actually hit that high before the "fad is over" or before adoption pretty much has peaked, but I don\'t see the price hitting $100 anytime soon, much like back in 2013 I (among others) didn\'t expect the price to hit $10 anytime soon either.': 1, 'This is about the market sentiment.

I.E. a critical bug in the algorithm (unlikely at this point) or banning by major developed nations (up in the air, but unlikely so far).\n\nIf bitcoin fails naturally, sentiment towards it is going to have to be like what happened to Myspace - people forget about it, adoption stops happening, bad news is more common than good news and the price heads south. If the general sentiment is not positive towards bitcoin then that is when I can expect it to "naturally fail". Do you really see that going on right now though? I don\'t, at least at this moment.

In fact, thus far I\'ve lost more money than I\'ve earned.\n\nNow BTCJam claims to have a default rate of under 10% with an annual return rate of 19%.\n\nThe key to your success is diversification.  Don\'t loan anyone a large amount, spread your lending out across multiple people, and multiple loans.  Just understand that one default quickly wipes out profits from others.\n\nNext, there are two loan types.  One pegged to USD and the other a straight BTC loan.  Let me explain these so you understand the pros and done of each.  If the loan is tied to USD, the borrower is responsible to pay back Bitcoin in the amount of the original USD value.  An example, BTC is worth $600: the lender gets a loan for .5 BTC. They owe $300 worth of BTC, it doesn\'t matter what happened to the BTC price, thy owe $300 equivalent.\n\nThis means, when we are in a bullish market USD pegged loans are great for the borrower, however they can mean a loss (over holding) for the lender.\n\nThe other loan type is more simple: straight BTC value. They borrow .5 BTC they owe .5 BTC.  Obviously if BTC sores in value this can be a problem for repayment, but its the better option for returns (unless were in a bearish market).\n\nAnother very important lesson to point out is "Reputation" loans.  They aren\'t all a scam. But if the profile is not complete and reputation loans is all they have, I\'d avoid them, its a common scam on the site.  Worse is people with lots of open active loans at the same time, especially numerous reputation loans all open and active at the same time.\n\nLast thing, I run a site which indexes the scammers over there: http://BTCJamScam.com if anyone has any scammers to report, please do so.': 12, 'Sure, scammers eat into my btcjam profits.

I got into alt-coin mining because it was interesting to do - I had 5.7 MH/s going for a while between 3 machines with 4 video cards each.

I still have a couple video cards and PSUs on Craigslist, but they'll go soon.\n\nAround when I gave up on mining I started to buy a few BTC here and there, and finally got to the point where I can't really justify putting more into it.  I made some paper wallets, and hid them in sneaky places.  I'm actually thinking that I will have a few BTC for each of my kids in a little time capsule - when they're 18 they'll be millionaires (or not).\n\nAnother aspect here is that when I'm old and weak I want to be able to tell my grandkids that I was in on the great BTC gold-rush of the early part of the century.

Our relationship became strained, and we broke up the business. At this point he did something very very stupid. He sold the server the bitcoins were stored on, without even backing it up. At least this is what he told me at the time. The coins haven't moved so I believe him. They were probably destroyed when the next owner wiped it.\n\nI called the police, and published all of this information, including my contact information and the best I had for him. He wouldn't respond to my calls or visits and just getting him on the phone long enough for him to tell me what happened to the server was hard.\n\nAt the time BTCinch dissolved, it had less than $3000 worth of customer BTC stored on the server. It also had $5000 of company funds. Most of the accounts were very small, as the wallet never gained momentum and people tended to just make trial accounts. There were a few larger accounts, though, and one in particular who held the majority of the funds.\n\nI posted the details I am repeating here on the bitcointalk forum and started working my ass off to make the money to pay people back. As I'd poured my savings into the business, it took me a month or two. In the end, I was able to contact the largest account holders and paid them back the in full (USD value).

I avoid using the FRR entirely. Partly because it never seems to be in sync (either it's stuck too high to get taken, or it's substantially lower than you could get with a fixed-rate offer), and right now generally means throwing your cash on the top of an enormous pile of pre-existing offers. Partly because I'm using a spreadsheet to keep track of my swaps and predict/check each day's payment, and the variable rate makes that difficult to do accurately.\n\nMy mental model of the swap market assumes that there's a fairly steady drip of small swap demands taking the lowest offers, and every so often a larger spike of demand for some big trade (or an ongoing position needing a fresh swap). I aim to place orders where they have the best odds to be close to the top of that kind of spike. So I'm generally looking for an 'elbow' in the graph of existing offers - a point reasonably close to the bottom of the list (normally around the 30-50K mark), and tucked just under some other sizable offer.\n\nFor duration, I try to spread the expected repayment dates out over the coming week, so that I'm not constantly trying to push my entire balance into offers, and to reduce how often each chunk of cash goes through the inevitable down-time between one swap closing and a new one being taken. So generally offering at ~7 days, but when swaps are returned early it leaves gaps to fill with shorter duration offers. Offering slightly higher durations also means that if the offers list has a long tail of low-rate 2-day offers I might try the 'strategy' of ignoring their existence and placing a higher offer with the hope to get picked up by someone demanding more days.\n\nWhen rates are doing the slow-slide they are now, I might also try to 'kick it down the road' by offering some 30 day swaps - if they're not cancelled then they'll hopefully be at a higher percentage than the general going rate for their whole lifetime, and in either case they'll take some of the pressure off - reduce the amount of cash I need to find a borrower for, so that I'm more able to wait around for a good deal.": 10}, ("None of the mods are 'bearish', is that problematic.", 3): {"Well  it's selection bias.

": 1, '"Big money" has had ample time and means to enter BTC if they want to. The only thing stopping them is desire.': 1, "the dude's a goon just ignore it": 1, 'I\'ve been researching the COIN ETF prospectuses over the past week and I plan to put together a more formal write up as my time permits, but I figured I could provide a quick response here.  First, though, I\'ll say that it\'s still a long shot that the COIN ETF will get approved any time soon.  The SEC is under no deadline or pressure to do anything but sit on ANY ETF application.  They have a history of dragging their feet for years when dealing with the approval of an ETF that would address a "new" market or product.\n\nSome background on the structure: The COIN etf prospectus states that they will initially release 1 Million shares, with each share representing .2 BTC, which means they will basically be putting 200K of BTC onto the market.  There are different entities which will run the fund, with the "Trust" being the administrators that hold the actual BTCs, and then they are basically selling claims on those BTC via the form of the ETF shares.  The initial 1 Million ETF shares will be sold to "Authorized Participants" (read: market makers) in baskets of 50K.  The authorized participants can then sell those shares to normal market participants.  The price of a share of the ETF will generally move with and reflect the performance of the price of Bitcoin according to the WinkDex.\n\nNow with that out of the way, here\'s the part that gets to what you\'re asking about:  The Trust can choose to create more shares (or reduce the amount of shares) at their own desire based on the market demand they see.  These shares must be created/destroyed in baskets of 50K each (so basically they move in 10K BTC chunks at a time).  So if the ETF sees high market demand and the initial 1 Million shares are bought up, then the Trust can choose to issue 50K more shares whenever they deem it necessary.  \n\nLast time I heard about the Winklevoss\' Bitcoin holdings, they were saying they had 1% of all bitcoins that had been mined (which was in April 2013), and that would put them around 125K at that time.  It\'s not far fetched to assume they\'ve already increased that amount to get equal to (or greater than) the 200K BTC needed to back the 1 Million ETF shares.  So if there is very high demand from Retail or Professional investors in the COIN ETF shares (since that would be the first true public market where you could sink your 401k\'s and IRA\'s into, as well as provide a low risk option to professional currency investors instead of physically holding the BTC), then the Trust will need to create new shares (50K at a time, equivalent to 10K BTC at a time).  Otherwise the price of the ETF would rise higher than the Winkdex due to the demand, and would therefore defeat the purpose of a Bitcoin tracker ETF.\n\nTL:DR - High demand in the shares of the COIN etf would lead to the Trust purchasing more BTC so that they could release more ETF shares.  The purchases (and sales) of BTC would be 10K BTC with each new offering/repurchasing of shares.\n\nEdit/Side Note:  I foresee the approval of the COIN etf being the way for RETAIL investors to truly plunge into BTC, but I don\'t think that will be the case for Professional investors.  The professional investors and banks are more sophisticated and will choose to hold the BTC physically to avoid the ETF fees, whereas Retail investors with money in their 401k\'s and IRA\'s really would only have the COIN ETF as an option.  The only way I see professional investors being drawn to the COIN etf shares over physically holding their own BTC is if the BTC exchanges are still too small and illiquid for the professional investors to dabble with meaningfully.  In that case, the pros would dive into COIN and cause the Trust to balloon in size rapidly, which would in turn filter through to the BTC price due to the Trust\'s open market purchases. ': 11, "DAYUM.\n\nEdit: Ok, i read it. Thanks for the more microscopic view of the structure, which i pretty much already understood. My point is that any increase in demand for shares, unless some analysts really fucked up, will be slow in the beginning, because the ETF has already acquired coins for the shares.\n\nIf they have all the coins necessary currently, then there won't be an increase in price, right? Do you foresee substantial demand growth immediately upon its launch?": 2, "Until market makers are officially identified and the coin is approved by the SEC and ready for launch, it will be very difficult to get a read through on the true upcoming demand.\n\nBut for perspective, if the SEC approved the fund today, and they could be ready to launch next week, and let's say the price of BTC at that time was $600/BTC, then the entire Net Asset Value of the ETF at launch would be only $120 Million.  That's practically nothing.  If the fund gets approved, I would expect it to grow substantially from it's initial $120 Million.  Even at a clean Billion dollar NAV, that's still tiny when compared to similar existing ETFs.  \n\nLast thought: The price won't wait for the fund to launch.  The price will move when there is even a hint that the SEC is going to approve the ETF. ": 11, 'The only thing stopping them is desire. They can enter at any time they wish. You speak of liquidity as though you have access to the same coins they do.': 2, "Generally agreed, but it's also attractive because it has such a weird beta. It's ostensibly uncorrelated with the market, sort of like a fixed asset, so imagine getting tech startup-like returns without reliance on the tech market.\n\nObviously it's not that simple and BTC beta is confusing, to say the least. But it's critical, because investors are not buying BTC in a vacuum. [This](http://www.emeraldinsight.com/content_images/fig/2940100201007.png) is an investment portfolio; the risk free asset is a treasury bill and those dots are different risk/return assets. \n\nThat combination is determined by each asset's beta (asset performance correlation with the market) compared to the portfolio.": 3, "You're generally right. There's an uncertainty to the effect on the price, as in all things financial.  The ~200k coins we assume the twins hold--if the ETF launches, they are selling them all. This is an exit strategy.\n\nBut the gamble is that there is over 200k BTC demand that is currently being held back by the high friction (fees, regulations, anonymous eastern european websites) of the current ecosystem. If that gamble is incorrect, ETFs can and do fail. \n\nTo sum up: if there is more than $120 million in new money that wants to invest in a BTC ETF but not via coinbase, etc, the price will go up. Else, down.\n\nPersonal opinion: its plausible to me, but the money will have to come from uninformed retail customers, not professional money managers. Hedge funds have probably already bought in if they were going to buy in, and no one managing a state pension is going to risk their job by going crypto. \n\n": 5, "Fair point on the 401Ks.

The only reason that Bitfinex draws attention with its high amount of borrowed swaps, is because these data are publicly available. In other words, Bitfinex is "transparent" in this respect. \n\nThe fact that BTC-e allows trading on margin and that overall trading volume at BTC-e is comparable to that at Bitfinex, suggests that traders at BTC-e most likely borrowed as much as traders at Bitfinex. We can probably safely assume that the mentality of traders on these two exchanges is not any different to any statistical significance.\n\nAll this means that **IF** the sell off is to happen, it may not necessarily be caused solely by/at Bitfinex, but BTC-e may take the "lead" as well.

The fact that it did not happen in non-leveraged exchanges, such as Bitstamp and Kraken, tells there was an intention behind it.

I assume that the bulls on margin are on the edge of their seats watching the price, and they will sell at a loss before $500 to avoid liquidation of their collateral. \n\nThe thing I am not sure about is whether their collateral will be liquidated immediately by Bitfinex (which causes the cascading flash crash on the exchange), or whether Bitfinex could hold onto the collateral to sell a little later when prices are higher (like, the next day even). \n\nIt seems to me that automatic liquidation of collateral at the market bottom would be like Bitfinex shooting themselves in the foot. Nonetheless, it appears this is what happened on Feb 9th... but that sort of thing happening twice is definitely NOT GOOD for trust in their exchange and their long-term business.\n\nI actually had a dream about this occuring last night, and I would not be surprised if a flash crash on Bitfinex could be the echo of the Silk Road shutdown that serves as catalyst for another super-rally. \n\nThese is all just guesstimates, and me listening to my gut, I would love to hear what other people have to say on this question. ': 5, "I doubt there would be a cascade. You can't just look at the buy order book. Don't forget that as positions are closed, swap dollars are released back to the lenders.

': 3, 'You might misunderstand fundamentals here. I will try to address them to ensure we are clear. I am trying to help so excuse any tone if one is perceived - you got some upvotes so others could likely also benefit by ensuring there is no misunderstanding of how bitfinex operates.\n\n1. You state "bitfinex shooting themselves in the foot". In every situation, bitfinex profits. They are not loaning money, so they can\'t lose. Some users can lose, but those users decided to take their positions of their own accord... And when those users lose, other users win. A big loss or a big win for a bitfinex user is no different for bitfinex itself - they take their rake regardless for enabling the exchange by matching users together. (Feb 9th was a glitch, which they have addressed)\n\n2. You state "bitfinex could hold onto collateral to sell later". No, they take collateral at the moment its needed in order to make the margin call, so that the debt the user took out is covered. That means the debt they took out is repaid to the liquidity provider, including interest - bitfinex doesnt hold this. They don\'t hold the money that belongs to traders and place their own bets with it, they aren\'t in the business of speculation... They just move the money around accordingly between accounts, and take their cut in the meantime in the way of fees.\n\nWhat you are considering would be a huge indictment of ethical misconduct by bitfinex in misappropriating user funds. That isn\'t how it works.': 11, "Well, we're currently at 566 on Stamp. I said around here and I still believe it will happen around this price, maybe a bit lower.": 1, 'I really doubt that.

I have a better sense of Bitfinex's model from this. \n\nI had been under the impression that the flash crash was caused by collateral positions being automatically sold off on Bitfinex's thin order books, crashing the price on that exchange to $100 while the bitcoin price on other exchanges remained higher.": 3, "Pretty much $1 below $550 will trigger higher volume and sells   \n\ne: Oh, I forgot to say, hopefully bitfinex won't stop the trading platform during a crash like last time. \ne2: It would be nice to hear from whoever downvoted me, OP asked a question and I answered, downvotes are for spam or off-topic so honestly I would like to know why.": 6, "I'm expecting a short squeeze soon :)": 3, '[deleted]': 2, 'That may be true of the sub in general but in this thread specifically people are asking for a price where this will happen so by its nature every post other than "it will never happen" is bearish but you don\'t see everyone else getting voted down.\n\nAlso by reasoning, I don\'t mean why it will happen in general as, like you said, it has been said again and again and is implicit in the subject of the thread.

If, he entered at 625, then LP is 504.46. If at 600, LP is 484. \n\nI expect most of the low-pro longs have their base price between 600 and 650.

Take that first sentence seriously, because the other two methods I recommend are not 100% secure--although they are far from insecure. In order to set up the cold storage, use either a very clear and sophisticated guide for setting it up well, OR take the opt-out and use Coinbase.com's Vault feature.\n\n3. The certificates of deposit pile should be most of the rest of your stash, and should get sent to Bitfinex and loaned out on these settings:\n\n- Auto-renew\n- Flash return rate\n- 30 days\n\nThese settings make it a no-hassle system. You won't be maximizing profits with this method, but you will be minimizing time spent. This should take absolutely 0 time--complete set-it-and-forget-it.\n\n4. The hot wallet pile should be a fraction of the total, and you should keep it around to spend when BTC is a good way to buy things. BTC can get you some pretty good discounts (check out e-Gifter, Gyft), is low-hassle, and is very private.\n\nIf you want a little more information on Bitfinex's system, and would like to do me a solid and sign up with my referral link, I write reviews of exchanges.

No lender has lost money in those events, and we constantly improve based on the lessons we learn.\n\nThere is no such thing as a risk-free loan, and because of that, interest exists. We believe that the interest rates that are offered are very attractive for the level of risk taken on by a lender (right now the "flash return rate" is around 43% a year, calculated as simple interest, not compounded). If anything, bitcoin has become much more stable since December 4th. The market has expanded, untrustworthy bad actors have failed, the volatility has dropped drastically since those days. I understand that lending money may not be for everyone, but I do want to assure you that the protection of our lenders is our number one priority, and we take that trust seriously.\n\nIf anyone has any questions, I am happy to answer them to the extent that I am able.

We are starting to see a few people trying to duplicate what we have done, so our hard won experience in handling such volatile markets is very much a big part of our business. Secondly, if we give exact details of how we protect our lenders, we weaken those protections and allow people trying to do what was mentioned before. \n\nThe flash crash was a prime example of that. But, when one exchange has a price of $100 and another has a price of $530, it is safe to say that is an arbitrage opportunity, and what we learned from that event was to try to unwind positions in a more complicated but more orderly way. We never enter into positions ourselves, but there are a lot of bots that run on our exchange and others. \n\nOne other thing to remember is that although our book may appear thin, our volume is the second largest. One reason why this might be the case is because we allow hidden orders, something that other exchanges don't. So at any given time, our book may be deeper than it appears at first glance. \n\nI am still updating our FAQ and preparing an official statement regarding our policies, but we do have a third line of defense for our lenders. First, the collateral in the traders account. Second, our stop loss algorithms and risk management systems to extract maximum value from their positions, and third, a pool of funds to make whole accounts where there is a negative balance and they can't repay their loan. We have taken some hits, but have always acted as a buffer to protect lenders. More details on this to come. ": 2, "Never heard of bitfinex, or Josh Rossi?

Probably the only smart move i made as the price continued to drop like a rock. But china then decided to throw more FUD and shot up. So i bought back in at $530, china then went around again and i again panic sold at $450. This stuck for a few weeks and then it went on that nice rally to $600+. All the time i thought it was a bull trap or a dead cat bounce so i held. When it went past $650 i thought "Ok, fine, we\'re in another bubble". When it hit $680 i waited until it went down a bit so i could buy in. i bought in on margin at $660 and prepared for the next leg up. Instead it went down and the auction announcement made it drop even faster. I was about to get forced liquidated but my luck finally turned around and it stopped going down at 522.15. I would have been forced liquidated at 515. Luckiest break of my life. finally it went up to $660 and i thought i was doing ok. I thought now we were in a bull run so when it dipped to $630 I thought, "what the hey, buy in a little more!".

I've basically never seen it so stable before and I'm not underestimating.\n4. The increasing amount of swaps can have different explanations. We don't know. More bullish sentiment, simply more users (also that should reflect in volume), ltc is also bought with these swaps (probably miniscule though)\n\n5.

The swaps are not only a ultimately drain on the btc market cap but also put pressure on the bulls. Everyday the price is not rising these long positions are losing money. \nMost traders are not rational though. It is entirely possible that people hold swaps long enough to get in range of a margin call. And increasing amount of swaps on a constant price (the sum of swaps actually took a little break in increasing aside from the one spike we had yesterday) is definitely sometihing unsustainable and unattractive for the holders of these long positions. \n\n6. The rates seem not usurious to me at the moment. From past experience they show a bullish but not extremely bullish flavor. In January rates were at 0.25-0.35 reflecting the large amount of people believing we would continue from 800 right to the next bubble, in the following bear market (gox, china) the rates dropped to never before seen lows 0.1 to 0.08-0.05 (for quite some time) reflecting a very bearish sentiment. 0.16 atm seems relatively healthy to me, some people are still waiting for  the bubble, others see the cycle already broken.\n\n6. The high difference between the all time low free market interest rates and the rates on bitfinex are not necessarily btc related. They are also reflecting inherent perceived risk of the financial contract you are entering (short term loan, returnable every moment, possible to lose a bunch in a crash, counterparty risk (you essentially send your money to a letterbox country in Hong Kong on the other side of the world in a scammers paradise etc. etc.) \n\nJust some aspects to consider.

PSAR often will switch signals once it touches the price line. I think I did TA on that a few charts ago. PSAR hadn't quite said BUY but I did think it would. Eventually it did an we are at where we are at now.\n\nSecond, PSAR is great for seeing the momentum in trends quickly and filtered. For example, even if the price dips a few times you may see how PSAR, if price doesn't go low enough, stays the course. Lost the rest of my train of thought making an example, but w/e.\n\n[PSAR in action](http://i.imgur.com/mFjUYJb.png)\n\nNow in the picture above you can see how PSAR basically filter out all the stagnate periods from May 18 - June 7. However, when it failed to go any higher you can see how suddenly momentum in the SAR wasn't so good. June 8 PSAR switched when SAR was about to touch the price line the day before. June 10 was the day we fell hard. SAR did miss out on 14 - 17 rise.\n\nThe rest of this isn't in the chart, but on the 21st it did give a buy signal. If you followed it for the first few days the price did fall. Still, after that you would have been in the green.\n\nTo sum up. PSAR does often show trends beforehand.

A little whining here and there would be preferable to that. If the swap demand plummets, Bfx made a bad business decision. A lower swap rate is not going to compensate that much, this can be verified from history. We\'ve had 0.05% swap rates before and I don\'t think that period was a great success for Bfx, and certainly not for the lenders. Moreover, IMO the talk about "Bfx credit bubble" was nonsense. Feel free to disagree, but I did not see good reasoning in that thread, so here I side with Giancarlo.\n\nThe current stable situation in swap rates is/was very pleasant. Perhaps the borrowers would have liked lower rates, but the stability and predictability benefits them also. Pity if this is going to end.

I think swap rates could really plummet to the point where it would not be worth the risk for me to lend anymore.  I am also concerned about the plans to create a bot for margin traders to constantly search for lower rates.  Seems like that could mean that the swaps I enter as a lender would be closed very quickly whenever a better rate is available, and I'll have constant turnover of swaps.  That will be a major pain.  Seems like at that point all swaps will defacto become flex rate swaps.": 2, 'Looks like there will be no changes to the leverage calculation.

If swap prices drop a bit, you will have more loans AND longer term loans.  The only thing keeping me from borrowing for 30 days is the interest rate. I have to be very sure that I am right first.

The orderbook is very fluid, it is more a trading platform than a simple exchange. I think people overstate the risks of loss to lenders.

See interest rates on borrowing/lending Bitcoin for comparison.\n\nIf Bitfinex slips significantly below other exchanges Bids will appear very quickly. Bots and active traders will make sure of that.

Yes, we will, but not any collateral: we will use the required collateral \n\nLet me take an example : I have 1 BTC, I go long for 2 BTC at 600. I need 1200 usd to backup the position, but if have only BTC in my trading wallet. Result: no change, 1200 usd will still be borrowed on the swaps market.\nI have 600 usd and I go long for 2 BTC t 600. In this case I will only borrow 600 usd on the swaps market, the 600 other being provided by me. \n\nNote that the first example is the majority of our users case. Most of them have only BTC as collateral and go long BTCUSD, so in this case nothing will change.\n\n- worst case scenario the demand of swap would decrease by 1% ( we know because we have the balances :))\n\n- requiring users to backup their unrealized swap on the p2p market will increase demands by more than twice the decrease mentioned above.\n\n\n\n- we HAVE NO CHOICE. the current situation of crediting lenders interests daily but charging traders at the term of their positions means bfx is lending money for free, can theoretically run into situation of lending money it doesn't have, and this is ILLEGAL and increase our risk by lowering our reserves to cover traders default. \n\n- the fact that the unrealized swap can be charged daily means that forced liquidation implies less collateral to liquidate (since the interests are already charged), which is a lower risk, and this is not PR.\n\n- did I mention we have no choice because the current situation of bitfinex lending money is incompatible with the licence we are seeking?\n\n- the cascading effect of liquidation is taken care of by technical automatic filters implemented a few months ago after the February flash crash, not by those changes (did we say this somewhere?)\n\n- in short, these changes will only change swap demands marginally, if only increase it. It will reduce our risk by freeing up a very subsequent amount of our capital currently tied up In unrealized swaps. It will lower the amount to liquidate during forced liquidation. It will make the market more efficient by charging the true cost of margin positions to our traders instead of lending part of the position for free, using our swaps markets as a regulator more efficiently.\n\n\nNow I understand d that you find a 50%+ annualized return with compounding capabilities not very attractive, in which case I totally understand that you want to leave bitfinex for more interesting placement.\n\n\nHave a good day\nRaphael\n\n\nEdit: clarity": 2, 'A link to the bitcointalk thread should be included in your rightup.': 2, 'Nowhere.

There's such a gap in the fixed rate market over duration because the borrowers figure they might as well maximize their duration, and lenders are given no ability to close a swap if rates move against them. I think it would be great to have another swap contract without the callable feature where it seems both sides will want low duration. The auto renew and margin bot can help make these short duration swaps less painful to manage.": 1, "I'm guessing you weren't on Bitfinex in February. Or in December. Welcome.\n\nEven with a perfect connection between BFX and Bitstamp (this connection no longer exists and now relies on market makers/arbitrageurs) the combined order books would not be able to absorb 31 million dollars worth of BTC being sold without sending price to single figures. The whole leveraged book being liquidated is a real risk, it is in no way impossible. Cascading margin calls ensure that (each liquidation drives down price enough to trigger more). It has already happened once (in Feb; they rolled back).\n\nYes, people argue that BFX can wind back, and your point about its price staying close to other exchanges is also valid (but obvious, duh, arbitrage). But this only matters if the price spike down is limited to JUST BFX. And actually, your arbitrage (bids will appear if BFX slips below) statement is an argument *against* that happening - if you wish to sell BTC, you're not going to sell them on the platform with the lowest price! So all exchanges will see their prices fall.\n\nThe wipeout scenario I am talking about would require a serious drop in price on all exchanges, but that's all. No idea about the magnitude required as it depends on leverage ratios at BFX (which are not public), but it could be as little as 20%. Such a drop is not exactly uncommon with BTC.\n\nFinally, if what Raphael has said in the BTCTalk thread is true, than most of the open positions are backed by BTC collateral, not USD! So as prices crash so does the value of the collateral! So collateral is pretty cold comfort.\n\nAll this being said, if the latter is true, then the changes being implemented will actually have a massive effect on systemic risk, by reducing the leverage across the platform due to accounting for the additional risk from using BTC as collateral, and recuing the allowed leverage in such cases.\n\nIf you think 2.5 leverage is conservative in BTC land, I think you crazy. You're better off trading over at 796.": 1, 'Where do they say it was "intended to avert systemic risk"?

The Flash Return Rate loans always sit at the very bottom of the lenders' orderbook, and there are 3 million dollars' worth of loan offers at that rate, because people would rather take the Flash Return Rate than have to do any thinking. \n\nAnyone that wants to lend at a fixed rate *has* to lend below the current Flash Return Rate (unless they have inside info that more than $3 mill is about to get borrowed), and when those sub-Flash loans get taken, it drags down the average interest rate, and thus the Flash Return Rate. Then the next guy that wants to lend has to offer an even lower rate, and when *his* loan gets taken, it reduces the Flash Return Rate *even more.* The cycle lasts for months, and is only broken when a whale shows up and borrows the entire Flash Return Rate offering. \n\nThe Flash Return Rate is a self-fulfilling prophecy of lower interest rates. This cycle is what pushed rates all the way down to 0.05% in May.\n": 3}}}
