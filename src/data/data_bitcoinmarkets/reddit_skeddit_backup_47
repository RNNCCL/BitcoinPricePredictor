I\'m constantly looking at graphs and learning about different formations and challenging myself to grok TA on a level to where it can help me secure my financial future. \n\nI\'m more than happy to share my observations here, and present the reasons *why* I think a certain way, but I don\'t enjoy being ridiculed by people who don\'t bother to spend the time to try and understand things on a deeper level than "buy-and-hold."\n\nAs such, I will always try to give support for my theories.

Then, today we have a projected reversal down to the low of the day of $850, which is right above the support coming up from our last dip to 790\'ish.  Those are represented by the red asterisks.  Of course, this move is not confirmed until we finish the day. (Unconfirmed reversal is shown by the puke green shaded vertical boxes.)  I feel pretty comfortable saying 930 is pretty much not going to happen.\n\nThe move we saw last night was clearly  a bull trap move--popping up and then reversing right away.  To be a "true" point and figure Bull trap formation it would have to rise at least one box over the previous column\'s high and then reverse almost right away.\n\nThe interesting things about today, if confirmed later tonight, is that it expands the width of this formation to ten columns. (represented by the orange shaded block horizontally.)  This represents a real battle between bears and bulls.  The longer it goes on, the more significant the move out of it should be.  I have no idea if it will move up or down.\n\nLooking at the candlesticks, one of the things I would draw your attention to is the length of the lines both upwards and downwards.  Last night the upward pressure (long tails) made the thing look like the Brooklyn Bridge.  And just as quickly, it reversed to downward pressure (long rising spires.)  That kind of dramatic battle cannot go on forever.\n\nIf we confirm our column of O\'s today, the new set points will be a new bug signal at 930, down from $990.

My thesis is that what drives BTC valuation is darknet. Based upon this thesis I have been pretty able to accurately describe what the market is doing, why it\'s doing it, and what is triggering these spikes. \n\nHere is what will happen, through January. This weekend I\'ll be looking for a feeding frenzy due to pent up demand by people who desparately want/need their drugs before it becomes undeliverable. Either SR will be up, or people are going to go to Tormarket. Period. If they don\'t get their orders in this week, they won\'t have it before the new year.\n\nSo; right now the market will be flat up until SR is back up today, when it goes up we\'ll see an immediate rally as we have other days (it\'s been down since late last night). Overnight I\'m not sure if there will be a sell off, it depends on how many orders have actually been able to be placed. If SR is up for an hour a day, in that hour a ton of people are logging in, buying/selling/releasing funds. It also depends if the bears are shaking off their torpor.\n\nOver christmas there is a high probability of a fairly sharp drop. Speculators tend to cause BTC to overshoot, in that they respond to market signals way too drastically. As SR goes down for the holidays (currently planned, may or may not happen), BMR is down, etc., it will look like demand suddenly flat lines, and people are going to wildly overreact to the event.\n\n I say this because the mail becomes an utter shit show, lots of vendors stop sending. Buyers and sellers alike will probably be distracted. As well, I\'m expecting people in general to do last minute sell offs to do some last minute shopping. The only reason I am not saying "this will happen" is that I don\'t have information on how people will act over Christmas. I mean, people may just be distracted enough not to shit their pants. Maybe.\n\nIf people understand why it occurs, there should be minimal inertia going into the new year. If people freak out about a second crash in a month, well, lol, it could be a very, very good opportunity to make a lot of money.\n\nIf this happens, this will be your best bet to jump in. In the new year, at minimum, BMR will be up again. BMR is a very trusted site, the admin backopy is very well respected. BMR going back up is going to be BIG. As well, hopefully some of the issues with SR2.0 will be smoothed out, and people may get over their distrust of tormarket as the gossip about it is that the site is awesome, just few sellers trust it.\n\nIn January, again, there\'s going to be a ton of pent up demand, and with buyers/sellers able to do business with each other, BTC will resume it\'s previous trajectory. Seriously. 2 or 3 sites being up all bigger than SR1.0 is HUGE, with a bunch of other smaller sites popping up, all competing for customers. Like the last 3 months have been terrible for the darknet, and SR1.0 was just a tiny pebble in an avalanche of terrible news.\n\nI think people are shaking off the fear from last weekend, and even if they\'re not understanding the why of it.\n\nIn short, short term bull, mid term (in BTC terms) bearish, long term extremely bullish. Between all the new sites popping up with new ideas, new escrow systems, new functionality. There is still a TON of room for darknet expansion. There are more and more people who want to do business with each other. No one went anywhere. And the slice of the global drug trade that the darknet has is a very small slice of a very, very big pie.\n\nOf course this is all predicated on the conditions I\'ve outlined.': 4, '938 and rising...breakout?': -1, 'This thing is rallying hard - can it break 950 before the day is out...?': 2, 'I have been all cash for a while but I finally got bored and bought half a coin today at 858 when I felt it was low and ready to bounce.

You run up against time delays (which lead to fluctuations eating your profits), bank transfer charges (which just eat your profits), and max $/month transfer limits.

The end effect of this, though, is to decrease demand for BTC on the higher priced exchange (lowering the price), and increase demand on the lower priced exchange (increasing the price).

There are few current examples where buying with bitcoin is easier/ more beneficial than with fiat.\n\nWhat I can't seem to get over is that they can't divorce the two ideas of bitcoin's increasing price and its adoption. If you look at Bitpay's model, it largely removes any concern about the price of bitcoin, because transactions are instantly converted to fiat. It is strictly exploiting bitcoin payment for its transaction protocol, as it really should be. Thus it wouldn't matter of a bitcoin was worth one thousandth or one thousand dollars, the functionality would remain the same. In fact as pointed out in another thread, Bitpay's model doesn't really have much of an effect on the market, or at most will cancel out the demand by buyers by immediately selling anyway.\n\nSorry for the rant, I just wonder what people are really thinking in their approach to bitcoin.": 2, "Yes, it was just a figure of speech to illustrate my point - which is, that the functionality of the bitcoin network is more important to me than the price of my coins.  I was just trying to illustrate that.  \n\nI got into this whole thing, because of some really bad experiences wit paypal pretty much robbing me and forcing me to close a business i had been making.  I saw bitcoin as the best alternative to avoid those same issues.  \n\nI am sick of my bank charging me $5 every time i want to do a simple wire transfer to someone in the same country as me.  I am sick of losing 10% every time i exchange money when i travel.  I want a system which removes these middle men. \n\nAnd yeah, i know bitcoin is currently too hard for most people to use as a day to day currency, but give it time, and some teething troubles, and it might be able to do that.  \n\nAs for why i am here:  well, if i am investing my money into this, with some quite significant risk, then of course i deserve to get rewarded for that.  But hypothetically, metaphorically or whatever, if there were a way to trade my profits in exchange for the guaranteed success of btc as a system of currency in alternative to the current government / bank issued stuff, then yeah...that's more valuable to me than personal profit.

In a few corners of the world, some of those fans also "buy stuff with their bitcoin" - although in fact this usually just means selling bitcoins via the retailer\'s service provider and spending the resulting fiat with the retailer.  Based on that assessment, Bitcoin is nothing more than a bubble, and could completely collapse at any time.\n\nThat the market is, in fact, prepared to put a current value of about $900 per bitcoin shows that there\'s a belief that bitcoin could deliver a lot more, and could seriously disrupt the payment processing industry.  In other words, an assessment of the *potential* of bitcoin is already factored into the price.\n\nIf everything turns out great for bitcoin, then it will be worth multiples of its current value.

Now I am happy that I have taken the steps I need to ensure that I am not in that position.\n\n> you\'ll make craploads of money, and get to look cool infront of your family\n\nActually, I\'d look like a guy who took the family nest egg to a game of poker and won.  In the real world, in that situation, you\'re not a hero for turning the nest egg into a bigger pile of cash, you\'re a dickhead for gambling it.  It\'s a sure road to divorce.  I didn\'t take the whole nest egg, of course, but I did still take enough to make a difference if anything had happened.  I told myself I could afford to lose it all.  I no longer believe that.\n\nThanks for taking the time to type all of your stuff, and I\'m sure it holds very true for you in your life.  I\'ve made my decisions.  I have no regrets, they were the right ones for me.  \n\nIf bitcoin soars past the moon, mars and wherever else... then I will be rich - at least in dollar terms.  If it appreciates to a more modest (!) 2-3 thousand dollars, then it will still be a very useful amount of cash to have sitting in an account.

That's what this is all about... but... don't let the market force you out by tricking you (that's what it's for, lets not forget). \n  \nMy advice to you, is, ride the price up a bit, then cash out anything that (it turns out) you can't afford to lose, and keep some invested (as much as you can afford to lose). \n\nBitcoin, quite seriously could be worth 10x what it is now in under 2 years, and even 1000x what it is now is *possible* (however unlikely). \n\nSo, staggered exit. withdraw 20% every 3 months. Unless bitcoin bombs, you'll make craploads of money, and get to look cool infront of your family. If it does bomb, you'll have made more than you invested easily. \n\nTo invest in bitcoin, you are one of the lucky chosen few. Never invest more than you can afford to lose entirely. Hold on to what you saw originally. Don't bother trading - no way, never read this sub again - buy and hold, backup your wallet, put it on a non-windows PC / printout... secure it... remember the password... etc... and reap the rewards of early investment over time.

Go to large, however, you loose all meaningful resolution.  \n\nEven better though is to compare different scales to see what meaning you can yield.\n\nFor instance, I'm currently most closely following the MACD on the 4 hour interval.  But it's interesting to compare that to the 1 day MACD.  The latter suggests that we are still in a major down trend - but the former implies an uptrend.  How do I read this?  Well - the larger down trend is still probably playing out - but we still got some sass on the 4 hr that will take us close to the peak.

The last real bad news that came out is the Chinese news several days ago and that was largely mis-understood in the west (as this hao123 news indicates being that its a baidu subsidiary).   Other then that there are no negative forces pushing on the price right now socially except the bears claiming its a bull trap.  All else being equal the price will rise with adoption (due to core fundamentals) and there is already known pent up adoption from the Chinese growth, the newly fomented Indian growth (which looks to be a bit delayed) and the post thanksgiving growth (U.S. third wave adopters via the big news cycle right before thanksgiving).  All of these demographics are still getting their accounts approved and have a psychological price of 1000 set in their mind.\n\nGranted we could see a down swing if the bears sell more holdings at 1000 convinced that its the end.  But so far as we test it we arent seeing a lot of pressure in either direction.  But there is coming pressure in the up direction.  The real question is which will hit first and hardest.  \n\nEDIT: As a note Im glad about the western misinterpretation of the Chinese news.

By far the largest, but a lot of people are sitting out Sheep and BMR closure. And vendor registrations are closed.\n\nHonestly, as I\'ve been watching, I\'ve found that the price of btc has tracked pretty well with news in what is actually happening behind the scenes re: darknet. I\'ve been constantly hypothesis testing this, i.e. a.) given this assumption what would I expect to happen, b.) given the opposite, what would I expect to see? I mean I\'m not certain enough to put money on it as of yet, but a very simple test would be, "When SR2.0 goes up later today or this week, what will the price of bitcoin do? How does that compare to the previous trend?" While this is hardly a mountain of evidence or certainty, it is a very, very simple thing to do which you will have an answer to soon.\n\nI am not trying to convince anyone, but I honestly can\'t believe how many people discredit this group of people who are constantly buying regardless of price and the effect they will have on this market. SR1.0 was literally a billion dollar business according to court filings, the darknet market size and scope is increasing at a break neck pace, and there are at least 2 markets worth of vendors looking for a home right now and they\'re locked out of SR2.0 for now. I expect at least one other market that is currently open to get big, with all the others getting a shot of traffic due to the redistribution from Sheep / BMR. When BMR re-opens it will likely hold onto some of its previous market share and regain some of its previous market share. On the whole, the darknet markets will continue to increase in size at an insane rate.\n\nOf course, there is also the possibility of tormarket pulling a sheep, which would be a bad thing. However, there is actually some proof now that what prompted sheep to cut and run was that they had a large number of BTC stolen through an exploit... Which was subsequently done to many sites. So even if tormarket is the same people, they may not cut and run this time. This is what they claimed, but now there\'s some corrobortation.\n\n^^ is going to be driving what BTC does, IMO.\n\nThe thing is, if all you know of darknet markets is "silkroad", none of these events would really make sense to you, with what BTC has been doing.': 5, "Right now the price is muddling around about 950, not much movement. As soon as SR goes up there's going to be a huge surge of immediate demand. There will also be a sell off, but this is going to lag and I would guess be much smaller. There may be a delay on these based around the hours of activity of the primary markets.\n\nI'm guessing current movement is largely haggling / expectation of movement, but really nothing is happening right now. But once movement begins in one direction, how many people are going to jump on the party train? And of course, an inevitable correction, sometime down the road.\n\nHaha, of course, now that I've said this, I'm of course going to be wrong.\n\nedit: And it begins.

(You could probably whip up the same soft of thing yourself with either Access or Filemaker.) The software would aggregate it and then spit it out at the end of the year.

The problem with Bitcoin is not that it\'s so different and special that TA does not / can not apply to it, imo. It\'s that the markets are *very* manipulated, and they\'re not that big either, which amplifies that effect. All this makes it hard to plot patterns because a substantial part of the price movements are not really natural, meaning that they should not have happened at this moment or in that manner.

If nothing else, after watching charts for hours, you get the sense of where the price will go, and start seeing the patterns in the moves. One thing that struck me during the crash, and that i\'ve noticed during periods of high volatility is how all the price moves suddenly start to fit together much better. And then i realized that this is often when all the bots are deactivated, probably because the market conditions become too dangerous to let them run unsupervised.

First of all, from my observations the bear markets that follow bull markets are longer than anyone ever seems to expect them to be. Especially when your still close to the bull market, because its hard to shake the undying optimism. And especially with bitcoin because we are all long term bulls, we all believe it will eventually be well north of 1000, so its very easy to say why not now. Look at how great its done. \n\nThis attitude isn't shaken yet and we have gone down considerably for  a few days. 700 seems like a great discount on the $1000 coins of a week ago.

I expect somewhere around a 50% retracement of the fall so far which would carry us to the 900ish figure I gave. \n\nHowever, at that point I think ~~a huge amount of~~ some people who suffered loses in the fall will either jump at the opportunity to re-realize profits, or even get some money back. The closer we get to 1000, the more people who got in late are going to want out. I've seen alot of the really new people saying that its been too stressful. I also think that there will be alot of experienced traders expecting the bear trap and likewise cashing out, helping to drive the prices back down.\n\nAs for why I think they will stay down, its a combination of things. One is that the fall will scare a lot of the new money back out until a new cycle starts. Two I really do think its overvalued relative to where we are at time wise. Sure in 10 years I imagine $1000 coins being a legend, but at the same time it was less than 3 MONTHS ago that a large amount of people seriously questioned the value of bitcoin without the SR. One illegal website shutting down drove the price down, albeit momentarily, to $100 a coin. Three months ago. I just don't see a three month move from that point to 700+ being remotely sustainable, especially without anything big happening.\n\nChina has cooled for the time being, and as for business accepting bitcoin, times like these are really the least likely.

The bigger problem is that the widget which is worth 1 BTC today might be worth 0.9 or 1.2 BTC tomorrow, due to the crazy volatility.': 14, 'Very good point.  \n\nJust an update, my ONE, small item (one of the Angry Birds toys for my son) shipped...

Replace Bitpay with Gyft and Tesla with gift card:\n\n> Exactly, I was going to say this. People forget that for every SELL there is a corresponding BUY. So Bitpay is "dumping" those coins, but it means there is a constant supply of coins available on the markets for normal people to buy. Better liquidity is usually seen as a good thing, isn\'t it?\n> \n> That it takes a Tesla to get an early adopter to part with his coins and sell them to new adopters, is irrelevant. Essentially the new person trying to get into bitcoin, went and bought a Tesla with their fiat, gave the Tesla to the bitcoinaire, and took bitcoins in return.\n> \n> To me I don\'t see the bad here.

If it weren\'t for this, its use would be limited to a speculative vehicle, essentially limiting adoption. Bitpay allows bitcoin to grow without requiring the absence of volatility.\n\nOnly in due time, when the speculative nature diminishes, and acceptance broadens, only then will bitcoin serve as a currency not requiring an immediate conversion.\n\n> every time somebody "uses" bitpay they are in effect selling bitcoin.\n\nTrue, but they are also showing merchants and consumers that bitcoin is a viable payment method, leading to increased adoption. And even more, most people paying with bitcoin believe in its potential, and probably don\'t want to diminish their position in bitcoin significantly. I can see most of those people re-purchasing the bitcoin amount they just spent.\n\n> The true bitcoin economy remains limited to dark corners of e-commerce\n\nI think here, you\'re running ahead of things. Even in these dark corners, this transaction is only a final step in the process. The step preceding this process is still performed in Fiat. So I don\'t think this market is any different than the other current markets.\n\nA true bitcoin economy, as you described it, doesn\'t exist yet.

I lost an iPhone in the back of a taxi, and Amex replaced it for me.\n- price rewind: a new feature from Citi, where if the price is lower within a certain number of days, you get the difference\n- miles and points: every purchase I make gets miles and points that I can use for other things\n\nThose are the reasons I'd use a credit card over Bitcoin at the moment.

Not much of a hassle to sort. I'd be more pissed about having my phone nicked than anything else.\n\nI think you've missed the point i was making. Whether or not the protection is required, it is piece of mind and so at no point am i concerned. Even if i *most likely* do not need the protection, that's not the same not being concerned at all. \n\nI think the biggest difference really just comes down to how we actually use money.

That's about it.\n\nSo the whole thing of not being aligned with bitcoin's true values sounds silly to me. Bitpay is making bitcoin more useful. Down the line, Bitpay vendors may decide down the line to not convert everything to fiat right-away. Maybe bitpay will add a little slider to let merchants decide what percentage of each transaction to keep in bitcoin. Maybe they won't but some other payment processor will.\n\nI wouldn't get hung up on the selling bitcoin part either. every time someone sells bitcoin, someone else is buying the exact same amount. I'd argue it's actually very useful to accelerate price discovery and improve the odds we'll reach some kind of equilibrium at some point.\n\nI get that you're dreaming of a bitcoin economy existing in a little bubble disconnected from fiat entirely where nobody ever needs to convert to or from fiat.

Less volatility means bitcoin has better chances of being accepted by more merchants. Think Amazon. Would they ever accept bitcoin with the kind of swings we see today? Of course not.\n\nThe OP's point is valid, but he left out the self-reinforcing benefits that liquidity and velocity bring to stabilize and grow bitcoin as a currency.": 3, '>Also, a hugely important fact: every time somebody "uses" bitpay they are in effect selling bitcoin. That $100,000 car purchase meant $100,000 worth of coins dumped on the market and exchanged for EEEEEEEVIL FIAT.\n\nBitcoin is just as much FIAT as anything else. Bitcoin is still measured against the dollar no matter what way you look at it. What makes Bitcoin different is that is has potential to change the way things are done. Bitcoin still does not met the very fundamental requirement currency needs. Which is acting as a store of value.\n\n>"artificial" use of bitcoin which doesn\'t align with its true values. \n \nWhat? Bitcoin was developed by someone who is nameless. You don\'t think that person is a millionaire now? Bitcoin can easily be manipulated.

When there is a need for something, like bitpay, the need will be filled.

With credit cards I can still cancel the transaction!" All I can wonder is, who the fuck are these people? Who regularly transacts with merchants they don\'t have trust in and rely on the reversibility of payment? Nobody\'s saying we should throw away credit cards, and reversibility is a nice feature, but it\'s been relevant in maybe 5% of my whole life\'s transactions, 4% of which occurred on the black market anyway. \n\nIn the case of Gyft, they offer additional discounts for those who pay in BTC, so shopping through Gyft I can buy 80-90% of what I commonly need, paying with my coins, and it is literally cheaper than cash. \n\nWith a credit card, I have to enter all my card/billing info, and no I don\'t want your fucking website to save my card for future purchases that\'s insane.\n\nWith bitcoins it\'s like magic internet value transfer beep boop done.': 3, '> This kind of commerce is bootstrapped, "artificial" use of bitcoin which doesn\'t align with its true values.

The statement lower down on your link, "Long shares win" should be on r/Cringe.  And, as evidence by your post, other parts of the site are equally nonsensical. To use a different set of English words, that would be as equally nonsensical, would be "Go forward car warm".  \n\nTo properly explain this site, you need correct definitions.\n\nIn 99% of contextual definitions, to be "long" an asset means to have positive exposure to the price of an asset.  They are trying to use it in this way, but they missed the mark and are confusing people.  This is extremely confusing when the asset/contract goes up in price, when an underlying asset goes down in price.  Eg. If you\'re long a "double-short" (ie, bearish) ETF;  If the bearish ETF, goes up in value (the underlying would have to go down in value), you profit.  Many traders, with this position, would skip mentioning HOW they put the trade on, and just say that they are short the asset. The word, long, when used in finance, I believe was slang created after the word "short".  To be "short", originated, when traders would borrow other people\'s stock, sell it, hoping the price would fall, before they re-purchased the shares and close their loan.  When their trade was on, they would be "short the shares", similar to how somebody living pay-check to pay-check might be "short on cash until payday".\n\nIn 99% of contextual definitions, a "share" is fractional ownership of property, generally a pool, mutual fund or company of some kind. On this site, buying a "long share", is just, so, so, skin-scrawling wrong. One cannot own "short shares".  One cannot own "long shares".  One can be "long" a particular asset, for instance "shares in a company".\n\nIn 99% of contextual definitions, to "win" refers to a bet, or game, or sport where the outcome is zero sum and there is an equal and opposite loser.  If you buy stock in, say, Google, (that is, you go "long google") and it appreciates, you didn\'t "win".  You made a profit. Your investment paid off.  "Winning", might be what Charlie Sheen might say, but that\'s not accurate, since nobody "lost".  This site, is almost using the word "win" properly.  It\'s just, combining it with "shares" and "long", where they are missing the mark.  \n\nThis site, is allowing people to buy and sell something called a binary option.  Binary options are very similar to betting, where the outcome is boolean.  So, in that sense, at the expiration of a contract, somebody wins, and somebody loses.  But, you didn\'t "buy shares which won", or "go long shares which win".  You purchased a contract, an option, which paid out according to the terms.  So, in that sense, you can win by buying the correct side of the contract.  You can "win", by betting on the price going down, which would be a bearish bet.  If you purchased an asset which did that, then you would be long that asset, but you might tell people that "you\'re short BTC", and leave out the confusing part about how you needed to purchase an asset that goes up in value, when BTC goes down in value.  \n\nTo more clearly explain binary options, at the end of the term, the binary option will be worth either 0mBTC or 10mBTC.  If you purchased  it (went long/got long), for 3mBTC, than you earn a profit of 7mBTC.  If you sold (shorted / went short) the contract, and it expired at 0mBTC, then you would have a profit of 3mBTC. \n\nIt\'s extra confusing, because there is a bid ask spread.  At the time of writing, I think the bid was 0.55 and the ask was 3.4.  If these numbers were 1 to 1.01, it would be more clear that the market thinks there is a 10% chance that BTC will go past $1400 by the end of the contract.\n\nTo make it VERY simple, think about it as if it has a floor of 0, and ceiling of 10, and it will trade between those two ranges between now and expiry.

For example, you also held a few Tesla shares for 6 months in 2013 and sold them for a gain of $13k. You will be taxed on the short term gains of $13k Tesla minus $5k BTC = $8k at your ordinary income tax rate. If you made $50k, that's 25% or a $2k tax bill on your investments. If you only won $1k on your Tesla shares, you won't be taxed at all on your investment gains (since you have none) _and_ you can deduct the remaining $4k total losses from your ordinary income.

I can see the siphoning off of Western Union or Moneygram fees for international money transfers, for example.  This is limited if the only folks able to do it are those currently holding coins--the coins have to move to other hands via currency exchange.

It's looking a lot less likely.": 2, 'Yep, better get back in now.': 1, 'There is some truth in it, when prices sunk, people went to sell coins on the exchange that offered best (highest price) which was MtGox. So there is probably quite a lot of fiat there. \n\nI don\'t know exact volumes, but I\'ve been watching 3 exchanges for whole night, and from what I saw both BTC China and Bitstamp are following MtGox. Not exactly copying movenments, but MtGox is still most influential exchange. Eg. when lot of money were dumped there (to rebuy at lower price), other exchanges "waited" until this stopped. And it was MtGox giving a signal to rebound from below $700 today. \n\nBut on the other hand, I don\'t think we will regain $1000+ for longer period of time soon. There\'s definitely some bounce back, but I don\'t think we\'ll go that high.': 2}}}
