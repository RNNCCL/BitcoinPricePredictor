This reversed us up a long pole to a high of $710 in the early afternoon (EST.)  Since then, we fell back a bit to a low today of $663.  If we do not reverse back up during the day, this change back to O\'s will be confirmed tonight.\n\nNew numbers:  New Break Out signal is $720.  The Breakdown signal is $under $520.  The trend is no upwards with support way down  at $415.  This gives us plenty of room to play with over the coming days/weeks.  Our first bullish objective was met and the second level is at $720, which is also the break out point.  I guess I was a little off yesterday when I said it would be a while before we saw those levels.  The price would have to drop back to $600 in order to continue the formation we left yesterday.  Otherwise, we are now in a 2 column formation.\n\nThe rise yesterday was dramatic.  It looked like a short squeeze to me.  It also looked like a manufactured short squeeze with the bids being laddered up until the margin calls came in and the scramble to cover pushed the price up.  There are others who would debate that.  I am really not in the "divining why" business, but just looking at the trends.\n\nThe long pole up (movement 4 or more boxes above the breakout without any reversal) was a screaming short at 700.  I hope many of you got in, and out in time.  It was a nice pop yesterday and I did take advantage.  I sold high and then bought some when it was bouncing down.  Its been a while since I had been able to scoop cash off the floor like that.  It would be nice to have that happen every day or so.  But, then it would not be special--would it?\n\nI think /u/NotAnotherScientist said it best yesterday when he wrote, It wasn\'t \'good news\', but it was "the end of bad news" that drove the market.  I thought that was very Winston Churchill ("Now this is not the end. It is not even the beginning of the end. But it is, perhaps, the end of the beginning."  [Churchill Speech 9 Nov 42](https://www.winstonchurchill.org/learn/speeches/speeches-of-winston-churchill/1941-1945-war-leader/987-the-end-of-the-beginning))\n\nIt is almost impossible to see a fast rise like that one coming.  I think it brought a lot of attention back to the market after the doldrums we\'ve been in.  I\'d like to think there were a couple of guys somewhere in the world who said, "Hold my beer and watch this\xe2\x80\xa6."  The market seemed ripe for a little action.  \n\nWhere do we go from here?  I haven\'t a clue.  I think we scared the crap out of the shorts and anyone who bought in during the last dip to the $400s.  That tree shook pretty hard yesterday.  It would be nice to establish a base here and not drop significantly lower.  We seem to be bleeding down this morning, but not so much that it is scary.\n\nI am rebuilding my trading base and my cost basis is still way below the price, so I took a little profit yesterday.  I am going to let this ride until we see something definitive--one way or the other. \n\nA move beyond either Break point--either up or down--comes after a long pole in each direction.  So, it could be swift.  The long poles are indicative of a lot of movement without support, or resistance.  Therefore, they can come down just as fast--or up fast.  \n\nI would say keep some fiat nearby.  It might come in handy the next time we cross the $700 point.\n\nedit:  gave props to /u/Notanotherscientist': 56}, ('Flexcoin bitcoin bank hacked', 35): {'I gotta get in on this racket.

If it stays volatile, it\'s not a useful real-world currency, because prices are completely unpredictable. \n\nTo me this really points towards a world where BTC isn\'t generally used by consumers at all, it is instead a currency used for large inter-bank transfers or something similar.

Ex-poker player who went rags to riches to busto here... \n\nHonestly, you probably should not day trade. Its much harder than it seems. Its estimated long term 95% of poker players lose to the 5% long term winners. I would bet trading is similar. It takes years of experience, tons of book reading, study, discussion, and thought to be in that top 5%. \n\nSo thats my first tip. Quit. \n\nMy second tip, if you ignore tip one, is have a daily stop loss. You lose x% and youre done for the day. Done. D. O. N. E. Get up and walk the fuck away. Its not easy. But thats why you set the rule well in advance. X%, no ifs ands or buts. I dont know what X should be in bitcoin.. Pretty big maybe 8%, as its pretty volatile. \n\nIgnoring tip 2 is what sent me to brokeville. \n\nThe more I lost the harder I tried to get it back. The harder I tried the more I lost. \n\nAnd I did that shit for a *living*. I knew damn well i should have gotten up from my desk when i was stuck. I told people to do it. I coached people and taught then. But when my turn for horrible luck came, I didnt listen to that tip. I now work retail. Dont be me. \n\nFinal tip, keep perspective. Btc has had good runs in the past, sure. Dont expect it to continue. If it does, fucking fantastic. But dont count on it. \n\nRemember, if you make 10% OVER THE ENTIRE YEAR on wall street, youre a God. People will pay you millions of dollars to invest their money for them. At 10%.\n\nIf you day trade yourself up 3%, youre kicking ass. \n\nThis isnt a get rich quick scheme. Its a grind.

You can easily send back and forth bitcoins between your own addresses, which should not be counted as any real market activity. \n\n from user TedBently above\n\nThe thing is, usually you measure the volume in a market. So if people transfer money from A to B that means a certain amount of money has changed its owner. But with bitcoins it\'s common to transfer money between your own addresses. So if I have multiple addresses with little bitcoin I could combine them all to one "big" address. But that would be displayed as volume, money that changed its owner, while in fact it didn\'t. I could just send money between my addresses all day, creating a huge volume in the market without actually changing anything.\n\nThe solution is to give more value to bitcoins that haven\'t been moved in a long time.

I have seen LinkedIn profiles, but no public representation of any members on youtube or in the media.\n\nBitfinex keeps a low profile and do not advertise. We are a professional platform for experienced traders and we don't want to have a lot of customers with little money. I find the fact that you know the shareholders name completely off topic to guarantee the security of your funds. \n\n4) Bitfinex closing its doors and running away with my money.\n\nThis will not happen, first because we have integrity and secondly because we would be stupid in doing so. \nBitfinex is among the top 4 trading platforms in the world for the BTC/USD trading pair and our target is to be no. 1 within the next year.\nWe offer unique features (leverage, shorting etc.) and we are far ahead in the game.\nOur business will probably be worth more than any money we can steal if we play it right.\nWould you do it if you were in our shoes?\n\nThanks for you email and have a good day\n\n\nHi Giancarlo, thanks for your response. \n\n1) With regard to point 1 above although you are HK registered company, the bank is Chinese bank based in Shanghai. \n\n2) With regard to point 3 I appreciate wanting to keep a low profile, but some level of familiarity goes a long way.

For those that are, I\'m always willing to lend my expertise or even to manage their coins for them, because frankly I think coins are in serious danger when they are owned "naked" by people who don\'t have the time or fervor to obsess over best security practices. \n\nPeople can\'t really properly secure a serious amount of cash/assets without third parties like banks, though... so this, again, is just a question of infrastructure playing catch-up.

I feel that in light of these negative developments, the price may head south even more. Possibly as low as 550 mark. Thoughts?\n\n': 1, 'I agree wholeheartedly, and like the 80s rap analogy. "Impatient" is putting it lightly. From their comment:\n\n>my growing long term concerns is that the trend does not meet bullish expectation.

I worry the magic atmosphere will begin to fade if this goes on for too long. If it does, speculation will dry up and the price will recede.\n\nThis makes it clear that the commenter doesn\'t really know what they\'re talking about and is likely a very-recent adopter of Bitcoin. First off, it\'s *not* May, much less December, so why are they surprised that the price is "down"? Bitcoin doesn\'t really grow steadily month-by-month, in case that wasn\'t clear by now. It surges and recedes, surges and recedes. We\'re between Hype Cycles at the moment, and a once-huge exchange just imploded and went bankrupt. Yet the price is still *six times* what it was 5 months ago. \n\nIf you think interest in Bitcoin is *fading* you haven\'t been watching the news. Infrastructure is plowing forward (like it always does in the interims between bubbles, except much more so this time around) and mainstream media is watching like a gaggle of hawks. Even obviously-bunk articles about Satoshi\'s identity are stirring up interest. \n\nI am not saying the price will be $2000 by May, for the record.

But the truth is, I don't know what to think anymore. I feel we are still in a downtrend but that the anomalous spike to 700 last week suggests the market has some fight left in it. But BTC is pretty beat up right now. A fighter, sure, but fatigued.\n\nThis is on a tangent, but one of my growing long term concerns is that the trend does not meet bullish expectation. Everyone keeps throwing arbitrarily high numbers out there (e.g., $2000 by May, $4000 by December) but the negative news, shameful revelations, and looming regulations are keeping the price down. I worry the magic atmosphere will begin to fade if this goes on for too long. If it does, speculation will dry up and the price will recede.\n\n*Bear* in mind, it is way too early to make such judgments; I don't know where the price will be in 5 minutes let alone 5 months. And I realize that booms and busts and stagnation is only the natural cycle of Bitcoin; and that every time it has repeated itself so far, the price grows, interest accretes, and dreams soar.\n\nBut what if it isn't a crash that threatens it, but a general, growing sense of disillusion due to unmet meteoric expectations? All of a sudden a modest increase over a long period becomes bad news and a furthering stagnation becomes even worse news. That's what I'm worried about in the coming months.\n\nI'm a long term bull. I've been bearish for the past few months, sure, but I realize that I am liable to wake up one day and find the price double or triple what it was and so I continue to keep my eye on the ball while in fiat. I think our fortunes will turn and the yellow fields will wash over with rich green once more. But sometimes I'm cynical.\n \nIn many ways, Bitcoin came into the world hitting on all cylinders. And I think over the years it will continue to push the envelope. It'll grow wildly and thrive richly in a brave new world. But on the off chance it does die, I doubt it'll depart like it has arrived, in a frenzy of enthusiastic fire.

The effect on society is actually very interesting.\nConsider that most banks are willing to claim high and low that they have excellent security. While they depend on things like Java in a browser (which has hundreds of security reports every year), they depend on a credit card that has all its info printed on it you can read with the naked eye. Many banks still don\'t have two-factor-security to access their web-banking...\n\nMy point being that banks claim they are secure and on various occasions tell people they must have lost their pin code or something like that, if they are hacked, just so those banks can avoid payment.\n\nSo, I think you are focussing on security and support in the current system. But I\'m willing to bet you never actually used it. Like most people never had to file a claim at an insurance. Its not as great and not as simple as you think it is.
