A quick google tells me that Australia is "worth" about $6 trillion USD.  \n\nTo get to that point, BTC would have to increase another 1000 times what it is worth right now.  And common sense says that with such an increase, would of course come some pretty extreme volatility. \n\nSo, really, i think if BTC is to \'succeed\', it would be mostly as an medium for saving/storing funds. \n\nFor actual day to day spending, i think what we really need is some sort of intermediate crypto currency, tied to the current monetary system.  For example, if there were a USC, which was a cryptocoin which was always equal to exactly $1 USD, people could convert that to USD for spending and not have to worry about the volatility.  \n\nI do agree with the people who say that BTC is like both Gold AND paper money, but there was a reason people stopped trading in Gold for day to day transactions.  I think we do need some sort of intermediate. \n\n*edit.  of course, the \'paradigm shift\' option is the most ideal.

Having a large wall on the order books like that will create skepticism from the buy side traders, as they will see it as a major hurdle to overcome if the price is going to continue moving higher.  The likely outcome is that it will hold the price down as people are reluctant to buy in right before the price hits a major wall.  The wall has basically created a stable price point for a trader to buy at over time without fear that the price will skyrocket on them.\n\nSo if a large holder wanted to add to his current holdings before a massive price increase, then it would be advantageous to put a sell side wall up to artificially hold prices lower while they continue to accumulate coins at the current rate.

Not a 100% guarantee, but probably a good assumption.)  Or B: You are someone like the Winlkevoss twins with a large amount of capital and a financial motive to accumulate BTC.

The 10k+ order was placed as a single order last night at $273, just $0.48 higher than the Gox high.  This morning the wall was taken down after being up for about 9 or so hours, and then another wall about the same size was put up at around 267.  I find it highly unlikely that this is anything other than someone trying to sell a lot of coins at these new highs given that the ask price isn't that much higher than current price and could easily be hit by even a modest size buy.\n\nThe only reason I bring this up is because I've already seen posts from others in other threads making positive assertions that that sell wall is fake, or there as a message to the market that they are holding, or other such speculations.

They come and they go.": 3, "That's true enough, if the person viewed those sell walls being hit as a desirable thing.  I guess I was sort of thinking in the context of someone who has 10k btc, the only reason I can imagine them going to such lengths to get more would be if they valued their BTC holdings higher than there fiat holdings, which is why it didn't make sense to me.\n\nAnyway, it's been a nice discussion, cheers!": 2, 'Japan can.': 1, "A very valid assertion.  People will believe what they want to believe (hint hint: people will believe what best supports their desired outcome).\n\nThough I'd also point out that my original speculation would still hold true given that the wall has moved lower to $266.90.  The original wall at $273 stood firm until the price dropped quickly to below $250.  At that point, having a wall up at $273 wouldn't have the same affect as it did before because most people wouldn't even look that far down the order book.  So it would be appropriate to move the wall lower so that it remains in the markets mind, and continues to inhibit the bulls from bidding the price up.  The trader would then be able to continue accumulating at a lower price than he originally planned, and the risk of his wall being overrun has really not increased much.  He would just sit there and buy out any new sell orders that came into the book below his sell wall price of $266.90, slowly accumulating.  For his wall to be overrun, it would take several million dollars of market orders to flow in at once, and we haven't been seeing market orders come in for that many BTC during this runnup.  Typical large orders have been more in the 1-2K range, which is well shy of the current 6.5K wall.  Plus I'd bet that the trader has a trading platform in place that would pull the sell side bid if there was any threat of the price reaching his wall.  Again, **pure speculation, people**.\n\nEDIT:  Afterthought - Even if a large buy order did come in and let's say that it eats away 1K of the traders sell wall at 266.90.  It would still be a win for him because he would essentially be averaging down his cost of BTC because he'd be selling 1K at 266.90, but he would have been slowly accumulating a similar amount of BTC at a lower price throughout the day.  Exchange fees would eat into that a little bit, but if you're trading this much BTC, your exchange fees would be very very low.  Basically he'd just have to get a $1-$2 spread to profit.": 2, 'Oh I agree, the lack of skepticism around the BTC world is alarming to me.  I try to play devil\'s advocate around here, but it\'s frustrating how often I get bombarded by people who just want to shout "To da moon!" and won\'t actually think about what I\'m saying.\n\nI guess in my example the motivation would be greed.  The motivation is usually greed, and the fact that the BTC market is easily manipulated.  Also, I disagree with that last statement (this part: "...to justify the risk of losing to a large buy").  See, I don\'t really view that as a risk, as the trader would just be locking in gains and booking profits, whereas if the wall never got taken down, he would still just be seeing profits on paper.  For me, I see more risk in holding a large position into a bubble burst than in selling at new all time highs.

Fontas spent the entire month of October crashing ltc to $1.60 (this was his "pre ltc ipo pump"). So now it looks like the price has been skyrocketing, but really all the movement back to $2.40-2.50 was just the market being allowed to return to normal. The gains on top of this are essentially "real".\n\nIn your post on /r/litecoin, you assume that the news out of China is just hype. I can assure you that is not the case. LTC has definitely taken off in China. The #1 highest volume ltc pair is ltc/cny at fxbtc.com. In the past 24 hours 1,061,395 ltc have been traded there. And you are incorrect to assume they have zero trading fees. They do have a trading fee of 0.2% on buys and sells. You can see that very clearly by looking at the right hand side of this page:\nhttps://www.fxbtc.com/s/ltc_cny\n\n': 1, "So LTC has two options when bitcoin's fiat price is on the rise.\n\n1. Gain value from simply holding steady to LTC/BTC ratio. So bitcoin goes from $200 to $300, but it's exchange with LTC stays static at 0.01. LTC still gained 50% value with no movement.\n\n2. If LTC is overvalued from a static LTC/BTC ratio, people will sell off LTC to devalue it to what it's perceived valuation should be. \n\nWhat I find fascinating is that LTC is *gaining and holding value* from the price of BTC going up. Furthermore, bitcoin's rise in price is pushing up the value of almost all digital currencies. I think part of it is because digital currency to digital currency is more liquid than digital to fiat, so people would rather trade into LTC or other digital currency than to fiat in times of volatility. I could be totally wrong, but it is a thought. \n\nAs for the manipulation, it's pretty clear, but I think of it as being part of the growth process. ": 3, 'Thanks for some of this insight.

They have about a 3 week lag on getting the transfer complete, which is actually lower than it was for a while (at least in my experience).\n\nI used to do a lot more arbitrage between the 4 top exchanges, but the opprotunities for that have been thin as of late.\n\nCheers!": 2, "Thanks for the info about the withdrawals! Those fees are high, and the limits are low. It sounds like for a $1000 withdrawal, Gox charges a 2% fee, and your bank adds an extra 3-6% fee. So, if you've got a good bank that charges the minimum in fees, then a 5% price spread is right at the break-even point for arbitraging in the current market. It is possible that enough people are doing this, which is the reason for the recent lower spread.\n\nFollow-up questions if you don't mind: Is the $1000/day limit a hard limit, or can you increase it? Also, how long does it take for them to process the $1000 withdrawal?\n\n> I wouldn't focus too much on the % difference at the moment.\n\nHmm, I think that the percent difference is all that really matters when it comes to arbitrage though. Imagine if the BTC price hits $1000 and the spread between Gox and Stamp is still only $10 (a 1% spread). If Gox withdrawal fees still work out to 5%, then at this point it would be profitable to arbitrage in the *other* direction, which would gradually increase the spread.": 5, "I'm not sure I see the reasoning on how decreased volume can lead to lower spread.\n\nI suppose that decreased volume could make it harder for accurate price discovery to occur, which might mean that the recent lower price on Gox is just an anomaly (e.g. this is the reason CampBX has such a different price I beleive). However, I don't think Gox's volume has fallen so low that this is the case.": 2, "I've been able to withdraw, but it is the $1000/day limit that prevents arbitrage.  ~$20usd from gox per withdraw, plus your own banks fees for the wire transfer.

It costs 30-60usd to withdraw depending on your bank, so just not worth it.\n\nPlus the spread in absolute terms is about the same $10-$15 that it has been for a while.  I wouldn't focus too much on the % difference at the moment.": 1, "i have come to realize that it doesn't matter exactly what the spread is.

Experienced traders do not telegraph their intentions by placing a large buy/sell order on the books ahead of time.  Most of these abrupt market moves (both up and down) are happening in seconds due to large market orders being placed (example: Somebody bought about 3K-4K of BTC in a market order today and ramped the price from 247 into the 250s pretty instantaneously.  That order wasn\'t on the books before it was placed, which is the norm.)  So as the price moves higher, a lot of coins will hit the market as people look to lock in gains.  And if a large enough player steps in to drop 5k-10k in BTC on a single market sell order, they would crater the market and fuel a huge selloff.\n\nWhat I\'m most concerned about is exactly what you\'ve pointed out above.  The BTC market is becoming more and more illiquid in the sense that it would only take $10 Million of new money flowing into BTC to drive the price well into the 300\'s.  That $10 Million purchase would drive nearly a Billion dollars worth of wealth creation in BTC market value.  That\'s a scary scary thing to me.  That\'s not a "healthy" market to me.

It will be far more difficult for the market to make the same type of dramatic ramps we've seen in the past because of the sheer amount of buying power needed to sustain a rally like that now.  \n\nFor example:  To move from $240 to $300 would represent approximately $700 Million in increased total market value.  A move to $350 would represent around $1.2 Billion in increased market value, and a move to $400 is over $1.8 Billion.

Yes, as the price increases some coins will be freed up for sale, but look at the total coins available on the three major exchanges (bitstamp, mt. gox and btcchina).  All together, there are what, approximately 35,000 coins available?  When the price was lower there usually were alot more coins available.  See the last chart at the bottom at \n\nhttp://blockchained.com\n\nThis is just Mt.

That being said, I think there is ample evidence that, barring any other bad news in the coming days, we could see a real supply shortage that could send the price leaping.

When using log graphs to see relative gains it is easy to ignore the difference in the amount of work it takes to maintain the same type of growth on a log scale.

Without something new happening, reaching ATH, or something to generate media attention I don't see this run going much farther.\n\nOf course I would love to be wrong, as I have trailing stop sells so I am happy to see the price go as high as it wants, I'll be ready for the correction whenever it might be.": 5, "These timescales are incredibly different from each other.

I concur that this is exactly the kind of deflationary spiral Krugman and other critics have been warning of.\n\nWhat's more: I can only guess, but I believe the percentage of bitcoins spent vs. sold and hoarded has gone down with the demise of SR and with the buy panic I am not holding my breath for more spending.": 3, "From what I remember of the last bubble, things didn't really start to get crazy until we broke through the old high.

If I had enough money to blow I could make it $300 right now by simply buying BTC at $300 for a sustained period. Bubbles are bubbles because they tend to be an overvaluation of the investment, and when things are overvalued the "real market value" tends to go on pause until someone remembers it.\n\nNow, I\'d agree with you if you were arguing that going to $300 would require hundreds of millions for BTC to find a stable price floor and "true value" at that price. But in a bubble, this doesn\'t matter. All it takes is a guy willing to buy or continue trading at a higher value to make the price $300 and enough guys doing that to keep it at $300. It won\'t take anywhere near hundreds of millions new money to do this.\n\nI think its interesting to know these values though, even if they too high, simply because it\'ll give us an idea of just how high people might be willing to go and it\'ll give us an idea of just how much it\'ll correct when this is all done with.\n\nThat said I *still* don\'t think we\'ll see as high percent gains this time around, not even close. Simply because there is so much more money floating around which means slower gains and so many more experienced traders which mean there isn\'t going to be as high of a level of crazy either.\n\nI think $300 is totally possible, maybe even $350, but I\'m not expecting this to go up to $400 or anything. If we were to do straight % gain then the graph would tell us "woh the bubble will pop at $700!!" and that just isn\'t going to happen right now. We\'re gonna have to live at a nice price floor around where we are at now for a while for something like the high hundreds to be attainable.

Over the weekend LTC basically went from "200" to "300".

It could go to $5 (akin to BTC going to $500) and I\'d be a very very out of position player, it could crash due to manipulative money dumping, and it could happen at any time since this whole rise is just completely out of the blue. The only thing I\'m betting on is all this big news with BTC and people on the street asking about it is going to cause BTC to rise, which will cause LTC to stop its current position or reverse it. If BTC never rises, I guess I\'m forced to go long.   \n  \nI just didn\'t expect LTC (the thing I wanted to get involved in) to make such a serious, steady rise with nothing but speculation and a  smaller Chinese exchange adopting it. I don\'t want to buy in now because it would be at a huge loss and I honestly can see the price reversing at any moment.\n\rEdit: hahaha just my luck.  I was convinced that buy suppor for btc wouldn\'t start till Monday at the earliest, and go figure it happened early.

To apply the *zero-sum* qualification to an activity you have to make a mathematical model first. Your assertion is typical of those who model the payoff of trading as the monetary profit/loss. By the way unless you **choose** a conversion rate between financial instruments the payoff should be a vector consisting of an entry for every financial instrument. As vectors can be added and have an identity element it makes sense (From the mathematical model viewpoint) to ask whether the game is *zero-sum*.\n\nHowever, in practical terms the benefit or loss of participating in a market don't equals the monetary profit/loss. This becomes evident once you take into account hedgers and arbitrageurs. A further illustration is this: Leave aside the tax and other costs for the sake of the argument; you go to the supermarket, buy food and spend money.

The rise in value cripples economic exchange because no one is incentivized to spend the currency on goods because they know the currency will be worth more in the very near future.

This is counter intuitive to basic economic theory. If you think something will be worth more tomorrow than it is today, then you\'re not going to sell or spend it today.

It even falls when the value of Bitcoin falls.\n\nIf lower prices reduced spending, why do we have sales?  Why do we buy technology?  Why do people pull back in spending when prices rise?\n\nThis is a great theory, that a rising currency will promote saving, but why hold to a theory that has huge counter examples?  In science, counter examples disprove theories.  In economics, they are dismissed because they conflict with theories...\n\n> This is the hoarding effect.

Do people decide that Bitcoin is too valuable, so they all ditch it?  Why would they both be motivated to hoard and motivated to ditch at the same time?\n\nI am only asking you to explain why value currently in bitcoin would leave.  I have explained how it will rise, and where that investment/conversion from dollars to Bitcoin will come from.  The sizes of these sectors (Corporate accounts, Off shore savings) and their liquidity are just waiting for an instrument large enough to hold them.\n\nHow does Bitcoin then fail to grow to do this?\n\n> Deflationary spirals are bad. Period. They don\'t facilitate economic growth. They don\'t facilitate stability. They become uncontrollable without some form of massive intervention.\n\nWe had deflation for 30 years at the end of the 1800\'s under a strict gold standard (The Long Depression).  Productivity rose, real wages rose, and even the money supply rose.  New farms new businesses were formed, and real GDP rose.\n\nSo no.  Not a given.  Deflationary spirals are ONLY damaging when fueled by defaults contracting a money supply built up by debt and fractional reserve banking.  Like what we had in the Great Depression, and like what we risk today.\n\n> I understand the Bitcoin communities desire for BTC to become the new global currency. I support this movement as well.

It\'s better to be pleasantly surprised than massively disappointed.\n\nIt is always better to use data and facts.  Maybe you risk disappointment, but you are still better off.  This is a technology that forces honesty.  Honesty in banking, in transactions, and in tracking value.  Nobody gets an "inside" position where they get free money just because someone decides to give it to them.  Miners work for their money, processing and validating transactions.  Heck, right now they are doing it underwater.  \n\nKeep in mind that *this is the most productive economy in the history of mankind*.  We produce more goods and services per person than any time in the past.  The problems with education and medicine are *not functions of real cost*.  They are functions of the failure to distribute wealth, and the concentration of wealth is driven by a dishonest medium of exchange.\n\nThe correction will be disruptive.  Maybe even painful.  But on the other side, with honest mediums of exchange without government and bankers interference (parties that have extreme conflicts of interest in managing monetary policy), we will be better off.': 1, 'You know, I think I will fix that.

In my studies on the subject, i have never come across a deflationary spiral such as you describe, except in theory.\n\nJapan has been described as being in 'deflationary spiral' by some economists despite having reached a 'peak deflation' rate of only -1.67% in 2009.  The results of this in the real world were that economists determined that Japan failed to grow it's economy at the rate that it could have, not that the Japanese economy failed.  It was self perpetuating in the sense that Japan is now actively encouraging inflation in order to change the rate, but i would not describe it as a spiral; in fact the Japanese CPI has been one of the most stable in the world over the last three decades, largely thanks to very moderate deflation.  This is the closest i can come to finding what you are describing in the real world, and it is not a particularly damning example.  I am sincere in asking for an example of an actual deflationary spiral - i would love to study the effects of such an event.\n\nFinally, the main reason i disagree with your 'economy and currency will collapse' scenario, is that people need to eat.
