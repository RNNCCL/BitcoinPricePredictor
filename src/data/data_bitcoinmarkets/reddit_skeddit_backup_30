Undoubtedly, the winning bid will be paid for, at least in part, with money that was not in a cash state when the auction was announced. It takes time and money to move that level of cash.  \n\nBut even if they were sitting on $18,000,000 in liquid cash, the barriers of entry that OP was talking about weren't the time and cost of sending the actual transfer.  He or she was talking about what it takes to store the new money.  \n\nThe issue isn't just security.  Yes, they could hire a consultant to draw up some sort of cold storage system.

That's super easy, but I'd still request proof.  \n\nSecond, I'd need to set up the wallets on my end.  Again, this is easy enough.\n\nThe next step would be challenging.  How do I communicate my wallet addresses to the US Government in a secure way? If they're just going to give me the private keys, how do they securely send them to me?  When $18million is on the line, coming from a known address, I'd be very worried about a jeopardized system or a MITM attack.  I can trust my procedures well enough, but can I trust things on their end?  \n\nLet's say they figure out a solution for that and everything ends up fine (probably a safe bet).

Do you have an accounting policy in regard to bitcoin?  \n\nDeveloping answers to those questions takes time and it takes money. Anytime I've been involved with an even moderately large financial transaction, be it paying a large vendor, moving money into a CD, buying real estate, or even just moving over employees 401(k), there was a lot that goes into it.  Those are all well established transactions, so the policies are ubiquitous and the legal paperwork is fairly straightforward.

That analysis will set the ceiling for what each individual bidder will be willing to pay (and each analysis could reach a different conclusion, but in reality this isn't a hard concept to estimate so they all should come into the same general range).\n\nFor example:  If I wanted to purchase 3K BTC on BitStamp right now, all in one order (which is ludicrous but helps to illustrate my point), I would drive the price up to $610 per BTC from where it's at right now ($590).  That's a 3.4% increase in price.  Therefore, as a bidder, I have no incentive to bid any higher than the average price I would expect to pay for those 3K coins purchased at market, which is conveniently right at about $600.  Does that make sense?": 3, 'I agree with you': 0, 'According to every technical indicator out there, this is in fact a grand slam home run.

': 1, '**Well below market price** \n\n(wrote this before getting called away for work; apologies for any proofreading fails as a consequence) \n\nI think people are missing a number of things when suggesting the price will be meaningfully above market:\n\n(1)  Anybody seriously looking to buy these bitcoins has other options outside of the market.  There are early adopters, miners, etc. looking to offload large numbers of coins all the time.  While there is more publicity here, any rational bidder will realize that there aren\'t just two options: market buy order and government auction.  At least two other major ones are "buy off-exchange from another btc holder" and "slowly buy on-exchange to accumulate without screwing up the price."  With the price down substantially from the 1st of the year (and "smart money" pays a lot of attention to year-over-year price, because get-rich-quick doesn\'t work in real finance and investing: once something earns you money, you always have to find the NEXT thing to earn you money, so a single good idea (unless done on a MASSIVE, George Soros-shorting-the-pound scale) isn\'t enough. \n\n(2)  There are significant barriers to entry to purchasers.   If you\'re thinking about throwing 6 figures into bitcoin, you have to answer the "how to store the coins" question.  That\'s easy for somebody who wants to use BTC to buy a sandwich or hardware from Tiger Direct, but much harder for somebody looking to hold and invest huge sums of it, possibly on behalf of others.\n\n(3)  "Smart money" may be intrigued by BTC technically and financially, but they\'re also smart enough to see the huge potential issues.  Uncertain regulatory environment and future, massive stakes held by anonymous early adopters that could disrupt the price, open technological questions about scale, reliability, and ability for lower every-man barriers to entry without regular fraud and scamming, etc.  People here shouldn\'t let the optimism of BTC price rise (double strength if already holding BTC) cloud their vision of how outsiders view the risk/reward of the investment.\n\n(4)  And finally, the biggest thing about "smart money" is that it doesn\'t get that way by over-paying for assets.  The only other financial transaction where large lots command a premium I can think of are M&A style transactions *initiated by the buyers and demand.*  If you have to sell a huge lot of bonds or stocks, odds are very high you\'ll do so at a discount to the buyer.  It\'s the way the industry works, and the smartest players are looking not just for high return and risky bets (they could get that at a casino) but extremely high *risk-adjusted* returns.\n\nGovernment auctions in general aren\'t known for commanding massive premiums.  This isn\'t Sotheby\'s.': 16, "As I've said before...  I don't care what the coins are priced at.

This is so nice of them! ;) Now Second Market knows what at least a big part of that overseas market wants ;) The smaller parts of it anyway, the groups big enough to buy ~300 coins, but not 3000 coins. Some groups are going to need just a little bit of bitcoin liquidity to get their own offerings going, local Coinbase equivalents and so on.

There are early adopters, miners, etc. looking to offload large numbers of coins all the time.\n\nI highly doubt there are ~30K in coins available to purchase in the private market at a discount to the public price at any point in time.  Miners certainly have deals in place to sell some of their block rewards (to cover expenses), but there\'s only 3,600 coins coming onto the market daily, and not all of those are going to be sold on the private market.  I\'d be completely guessing at the amount that is actually sold and the amount that goes to a private market to be sold, but I\'d say it\'s probably less than 1K BTC every day that gets sold off to private market buyers.\n\n>With the price down substantially from the 1st of the year (and "smart money" pays a lot of attention to year-over-year price, because get-rich-quick doesn\'t work in real finance and investing: once something earns you money, you always have to find the NEXT thing to earn you money, so a single good idea (unless done on a MASSIVE, George Soros-shorting-the-pound scale) isn\'t enough.\n\nA couple points here:  The price being down substantially from the 1st of the year represents Year To Date (YTD) changes in price, whereas Year Over Year (YoY) would be a comparison of today verses June 27th, 2013.  Yes, YTD the price of BTC is down approximately 22% by my calculation, but YoY the price is up 493%.  That\'s kind of unheard of returns in Finance.  5 baggers don\'t just show up every day.  You also said that "once something earns you money, you always have to find the NEXT thing to earn you money".  Well, many of the people bidding on these coins (from the names [almost comically] released by the USMS) seem to believe that there is plenty of return to be had in Bitcoin even after the dramatic rises we\'ve seen in the past couple of years.\n\n>There are significant barriers to entry to purchasers. If you\'re thinking about throwing 6 figures into bitcoin, you have to answer the "how to store the coins" question.\n\nThere are significant barriers to entry for the general public, but I promise you those "barriers" are miniscule and insignificant to any bank or hedge fund looking to bid in this auction.  $200K on deposit and some paperwork?  They will knock that wire transfer and paper work out in an afternoon, if it even takes that long.  How to store the coins?  You think that people willing to spend nearly $2 Million per block are going to have trouble storing the coins?  If they really don\'t know how to do that themselves, all it takes is one consultant being paid for a day or two to "secure" their coins.  This is a non issue.\n\n>"Smart money" may be intrigued by BTC technically and financially, but they\'re also smart enough to see the huge potential issues\n\nYes, I believe most all of us are smart enough to see the huge *potential* issues.  However, many of us also see a robust network that, so far, has managed to navigate, survive, and fix multiple issues that arose in the BTC community as Bitcoin has grown.  Also, most of the people bidding in the auction are people who already have a vested interest in BTC and it\'s success.  It\'s not optimism clouding our judgement, it\'s the raw facts telling us that there is huge potential with Bitcoin.  There\'s a difference between being overly optimistic and evaluating the risk-reward scenarios and reaching the conclusion that the potential rewards are worth the risks.\n\n> If you have to sell a huge lot of bonds or stocks, odds are very high you\'ll do so at a discount to the buyer. It\'s the way the industry works, and the smartest players are looking not just for high return and risky bets (they could get that at a casino) but extremely high risk-adjusted returns.\n\nYes, if you\'re selling a large lot of a publicly traded security, then you\'re likely to sell at a discount to the market price because you\'re putting a lot of supply into the marketplace.  However, these coins aren\'t going into the marketplace, as this is a private & sealed bid auction. These bidders can\'t just go to the public market and start gobbling up coins by the thousands because they would move the market significantly.  They could spread their buys out over time and across various markets in an effort to mitigate the price from growing due to their buying, but that only complicates the strategy and makes it less valuable than purchasing the coins via this auction (which will also have 0 commissions tied to it).  \n\nYes, hedge funds and banks are looking for high risk adjusted returns, but what do you think those targets actually are?  They\'re likely +20%, which isn\'t unreasonable of an expectation for BTC.  And they\'re certainly not looking to receive that return on day 1 of the investment.  Many funds give a position at least a year to work itself out to the valuation that they originally arrived at.  You\'re thinking very short term here where traditional investors think over very long time scales.  Like I mentioned at the beginning, even today the price is still up 493% YoY.  Hedge funds and banks kill for returns like that because they are simply unheard of.\n\n\nIn closing, I disagree with your assessment that the bids will come in well below the market price.  I believe a fairer assumption would be that the bids will be very near market price or even slightly higher than market price, but certainly not much higher than market because all of these bidders will have calculated out how much they would move the price by going to the public market to buy similar amounts of BTC, and that will set the ceiling here.  \n': 5, 'Woah, easy fella.

Since he\'s in control of accounting the fiat and distributing the coins, he can front run in a major way: \n\nLet\'s say he wants to get 5 blocks he can bump off the winners of the bottom 5 blocks and claim that he himself bid enough money to comprise the entirety of those 5 blocks. \n\nBarry Silbert gets to walk away with 5 blocks and pay the minimum amount at the opportunity cost of the bidders who got bumped off. Those bidders have their fiat returned to them and are none the wiser. \n\nCreating the syndicate was a really effective way for Barry Silbert to reduce his risk on the auction. Heck he can decide to bump off everyone and take all the blocks if he thinks the price is really good, or bump no one and not have to pay anything if he thinks the price was too high.\n\n**bottom line, the guy gets to pick and choose what he wants to pay (or nothing at all) from the winning blocks**\n\nKudos to Barry Silbert, that\'s some Dr. Evil level genius right there.\n\nThe part that i don\'t know is if there is some regulatory mechanism to stop this.

An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds, and trades close to its [net asset value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_asset_value) over the course of the [trading day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trading_day). Most ETFs track an [index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics\\)), such as a [stock index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_index) or [bond index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_index). ETFs may be attractive as investments because of their low costs, [tax efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_efficiency), and stock-like features.   ETFs are the most popular type of [exchange-traded product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange-traded_product). \n\n>Only *authorized participants*, which are large [broker-dealers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broker-dealer) that have entered into agreements with the ETF\'s distributor, actually buy or sell shares of an ETF directly from or to the ETF, and then only in *creation units*, which are large blocks of tens of thousands of ETF shares, usually exchanged [in-kind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-kind) with *baskets* of the underlying securities. Authorized participants may wish to invest in the ETF shares for the long-term, but they usually act as [market makers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_maker) on the open market, using their ability to exchange creation units with their underlying securities to provide [liquidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_liquidity) of the ETF shares and help ensure that their intraday market price approximates the net [asset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset) value of the underlying assets.  Other investors, such as individuals using a retail broker, trade ETF shares on this [secondary market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secondary_market).\n\n>An ETF combines the valuation feature of a [mutual fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutual_fund) or [unit investment trust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_investment_trust), which can be bought or sold at the end of each trading day for its net [asset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asset) value, with the tradability feature of a [closed-end fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-end_fund), which trades throughout the trading day at prices that may be more or less than its net asset value. Closed-end funds are not considered to be "ETFs", even though they are funds and are traded on an exchange. ETFs have been available in the US since 1993 and in Europe since 1999. ETFs traditionally have been [index funds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_fund), but in 2008 the [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Securities_and_Exchange_Commission) began to authorize the creation of [actively managed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_management) ETFs. \n\n\n>\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Gold ^exchange-traded ^product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_exchange-traded_product) ^| [^Inverse ^exchange-traded ^fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_exchange-traded_fund) ^| [^Dow ^Jones ^Industrial ^Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dow_Jones_Industrial_Average) ^| [^ETF ^Securities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETF_Securities) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+ciqwmxi) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+ciqwmxi)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)': 3, '1 share = 0.02 BTC or something like that.

In theory, the value of the shares sold and the bitcoin held should "match" at inception.\n\nFrom there, there are two different numbers you can look at: the trading price of the ETF shares (because they will trade freely on an exchange) and the net asset value (NAV) of the assets held by the fund.\n\nIn a rational and efficient capital market like ours, those numbers should match: people should only be willing to buy and sell shares of the ETF for a price that corresponds to the value of the assets in the fund.  But supply and demand for the ETF shares could screw things up - as many here hope, there might be so much demand for a securities-based bitcoin investment that things get out of whack. \n\nFrom there, ETFs generally (I haven\'t read COIN\'s specific plan) have an arbitrage mechanism where they allow authorized participants (large banks/funds/whatever) to exchange assets directly for ETF shares and vice versa.  Thus people could give COIN bitcoin in exchange for ETF shares, or could trade in ETF shares for bitcoins.  If the net asset value of the ETF and the trading price of the ETF shares diverge, that creates an arbitrage opportunity and the exploitation of that should force the trading price of the shares close to the NAV of the shares at all times.\n\nSo yes, over time the fund is likely to buy and sell bitcoin based on supply and demand inputs from the market.': 48}}, '07-02-2014': {('Speculation: Did Fidor Bank buy all the coins?', 0): {"> Coin IP address location: https://blockchain.info/fr/tx/9e95c3c3c96f57527cdc649550bf8e92892f7651f718d846033798aee333b0c3\n\nThis is the location the delivery TX may have been relayed from.

I'm not entirely sure where the future will go and if it exceeds my expectations then I won't have missed out plus selling 40% would set me up nicely for some time and I would want to wait at least until I'm not taxed at short term capital gains before cashing the remaining out.

"Our goal is to build reliable infrastructure and increase liquidity, which are two major challenges in the ecosystem."\n\n> **Bhama did not disclose Draper\'s bidding price for the crypto-currency.**\n\n>On Tuesday, the U.S. Marshals Service said there was only one winner of the auction. It auctioned off bitcoin seized from the Silk Road drug ring. There were more than 40 bidders in the auction, with a number of well-known players in bitcoin saying they were unsuccessful.\n\n>Draper is an active investor who has invested in more than 1000 private companies.

The only tools i\'m using are the BFX website, manually trading by hand (no bots) and a spreadsheet. Keep a close enough track of what\'s happening and these little things start popping out. \n\nTo answer your first question: \n\nWhen the exploit was possible (at least since august of last year, which was when i found it) the lenders would definitely lose interest. The exploit cannot actually *lose money* for the lender, they\'ll always keep their principle. But it would reset interest payments when the exploit was used. In fact i\'m certain lenders did lose small amounts of interest when loans were substituted by legitimate traders for legitimate reasons. It\'s when the exploit was deliberately used that lenders likely had massive interest losses as their swaps were constantly discarded by the exploiter.\n\nFortunately, with the fixes, interest is now charged on most legitimate transactions. There are still a few gaps where interest is not charged, but they are not the types of gaps that can be exploited on a large scale (as far as i know) so i wouldn\'t worry anymore.\n\nTo answer you second question:\n\nIt is certainly possible for the interest rates to crash long term. Lenders are always in a "race to the bottom" with other lenders to try and get traders to use their swaps. The trader has a lot of power in this regard: they can substitute a higher rate with a lower rate at their leisure. The lender is always locked into whatever term they originally set, and have to wait for the trader to give up the swap. This small imbalance of power means, overall, in a perfectly equal system, the lenders will race to the bottom as the traders continually substitute lower and lower rates.\n\nBUT the system isn\'t always perfectly equal: If there are more traders taking on riskier and riskier margin positions, then rates can sky rocket as traders race to the top. This happens every time there is a bubble, with interest rates of 1% or more being common. Another thing is that lenders that don\'t like the low rates can leave. The free market kicks in again and traders are now chasing fewer and fewer swaps, rates then go up. \n\nI\'m sure we\'ll find a palatable equilibrium as time progresses. \n\nI\'m personally not going to make a prediction as to what the rates will be in the future... if my prediction skills as a trader are any indication, i\'ll likely screw up! :)': 9, "Conversely, just because it's a whale selling coins doesn't mean it's manipulation.

However, flipping miners at cost or nearly at cost is profitable. Don\'t go gold panning, sell shovels and lemonade. I sell BTC locally at a small margin, and sell miners to folks sitting in fiat, I also offer services setting up everything from 200 GH/s hobbyists to 20 TH/s "prosumer" prospectors.

A lot of miners (myself included) have been waiting for this release, and their site was brought down as soon as the time rolled around. I placed a decently sized order after madly refreshing their DDOSd site.\n\nWhat's interesting is that although this happens with mainstream product launches, what doesn't happen with those is transparency.

Skip ahead a couple more blocks while their website was down, and that block saw 21,249 BTC move! But the transparency reaches further than that.

Could have the spike been from a bunch of miners purchasing BTC in order to acquire hardware? I already had my BTC ready, although now I'm somewhat depleted I may buy more. Miners have an effect on the Bitcoin market, not just by generating and subsequently selling new Bitcoins (lowering the buy pressure, right?) but also by newly exposed people investing in BTC heavily to acquire new hardware that is denominated in BTC (temporarily increasing buy pressure I think).\n\nNow, if you consider mining to be a mostly loss-leading hobby, then what these miners are doing, although generating more Bitcoin, over the life of their purchase they are actually creating more buy pressure than relieving it, keeping the market healthy by requiring costly upgrades as difficulty rises.

Everyone who gets in past a certain point loses wealth.

As I\'m sure everyone has noticed, we are on the verge of another bubble now, and I personally think that the breaking of this $680 level (and accompanying 38.2%) will be the confirmation we need. \n\nWhat I have added this time, in addition to cleaning up my work, is several indicators on the bottom. In the past, they have "bounced" off of a higher level that the main crash of that cycle did, and this time around this same "bounce" is rearing it\'s head yet again. If we break $680, that will be a very good confirmation for the coming weeks.\n\nI simplified this chart to try and make the picture I\'m trying to paint a little bit clearer, if you have any questions don\'t hesitate to ask!\n\n\n**[The all-so-important 38.2% level](http://i.imgur.com/OFu0sD4.png)**\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/v/6IKocgSv/\n\n_______________________\n_______________________\n\nOn a side note, my prediction from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2731ow/daily_discussion_monday_june_02_2014/chwxey1) seems to be coming true.\n\n>Additionally, as the liquidity increases in the markets and the economy grows, I think the "bubble pattern" will break it\'s 235 day cycle and start slowing down, along with volatility slowly decreasing over time. We see this in my chart with the time spans on the bottom. This is why the current phase seems to be "behind schedule" to many, but I\'m not worried. As long as we continue the next few weeks with a solid launch platform, we will still be in excellent conditions for a bubble launch.\n\n I have been expecting this bubble cycle to take considerably longer than the "235 day" window everyone was expecting back then, and by now it looks like that is set in stone. There simply is too much ground to cover and not enough things are falling into place. I started to suspect this was the case back when we took so long to exit the bearish trendline back at $450 because all of the things (X,Y,Z) that had to happen were starting to get more and more compressed. \n\nOn the other hand, on the larger cycle picture, things seem to be right on track.

I sure as hell don't. Even Goldman Sachs thinks Bitcoin will replace $200 billion in international remittance fees alone. Before now, you had to wire money from Western Union and pay 8-15%. Bitcoin's recommended transaction fees are about $0.06 right now. Merchants pay Visa and Master Card 2-4% plus $0.15 per transaction as well. Also, there are quite a few businesses that are waiting for the NYDFS to issue their belated regulations before launching. There are so many financial regulations, and nobody knows how they should apply to digital assets like Bitcoin. Even if Bitcoin never replaces any currencies (I believe it will, especially in developing countries with extreme inflation), it's still going to revolutionize the payment processing and international banking systems, and that alone warrants the market cap to increase by an order of magnitude. You can't have even a fraction of the amount of volume those systems facilitate migrate to Bitcoin with a market cap of $8 billion. That's ludicrous. Visa alone does twice that in transactions *in a day*.": 12, 'No, of course 3600 BTC/day isn\'t being poured in. That would be devastatingly visible on the exchanges. \n\nIf you look at the post I replied to:\n\n>$2.3M is flowing into bitcoin every day to hold the price steady at $650. (Either the miners are holding or they are selling to buyers.)\n\nWe\'re talking about how much fiat has to flow into the market to maintain the price to offset supply. 3600/BTC day is being generated, of course not all of it is put to market, but the act of holding as a miner means that at some point in the future, they will still sell. Hence what I called deferred cost. For example, today 3600BTC is generated, but if every single BTC was held until tomorrow, then we still have 7200BTC  * $650 of fiat that needs to flow in by tomorrow. If all of that is held yet another day, then its 10,800BTC * $650 worth of fiat that needs to flow in by the day-after-tomorrow. (Of course, it could not just be fiat, but equivalent worth of services/goods if kept in a closed btc-only transaction loop. That and end-game cryptocurrency supplanting traditional fiat supply is a different conversation).\n\nThe high costs with generating the coins have no direct bearing on the price, overall supply of BTC, or demand. Only in an rather indirect way of reinforcing "how strong is the bitcoin network", and thus possibly influencing new buyers (with their new $).\n\nIt could cost $2m/day for the entire bitcoin network in operating costs in electricity, labor, etc, or it could cost $10 a day for a dozen CPU miners if that was the extent of the network. Either way, the same 3600BTC come out a day. Most importantly, that $2m or $10 in operating costs do not go in any way into the actual exchange market that dictates price. It goes to the electricity suppliers, ASIC manufacturers (which cash into fiat), etc.\n\nSo to clarify, I don\'t mean that there isn\'t necessarily $2m "invested" in general into bitcoin, but that mining costs are not sensible to count towards the fiat-demand side of the price-stability equation.\n\nEdit: OK, so to your point that \n\n>The payment of coin maintenance costs are first borne directly by the miners. If they sell the coins, then those costs can be passed along to others.\n\nYes you can look at it that way, by holding/defering, the miners are bearing that maintenance cost. But that is a burden *in addition to* operating costs, the two don\'t somehow cancel each other out. And until the miners are able to sell for fiat or goods/services in a closed BTC-only transaction loop, that leaves a hole/deficit to maintain that price equilibrium previously discussed.\n\n\n': 3, "That means you bought before it went to $1100.

Then when it reaches a super high point, blockchain days destroyed suddenly start shooting up as old hoarders move coins to take profit and earlier buys start getting antsy.

That\'s why they shot up to 8000CNY ($1300USD), while Gox peaked barely to $900, Stamp was in the uppper $700s. I think it\'s safe to say that such a ridiculous jump on China was do to extreme circumstances, that though Gox/Stamp could try to follow that peak, there had to be the obviously a huge difference in fiat buying power to power through the same type of climb that China did.

If people did, and then wore bear flair, and stated their BTC/fiat ratio, and had something near 25/75 or so, I might pay more attention to them. But no skin in the game makes it easy to throw darts.\n\nHere\'s the understated way to do it:\n\n* Volume is low (this only says that volume is low, but also potentially implies that new large buyers are not buying large amounts and that sellers are holding rather than take todays prices ... bitcoin markets are becalmed, waiting for some wind in the sails or the next storm)  There are many markets, and it\'s causing problems for analysis that a lot is now happening on markets without a fee (OKCoin), interesting maker-taker fees, or off-blockchain (Coinbase), and it seems like the number of foreign regional markets and brokers is absolutely exploding - without a lot of guarantees that any of them are safe to use. It\'s getting hard to really track "The Market".\n* Contrarian investing is a thing. If people expect a price rise in a big way, maybe there\'s a bearing short opportunity. Hope is not an investment strategy.\n* Consumer adoption is lagging behind merchant adoption. As big name merchants like NewEgg and Expedia come on board, it seems like old holders are cashing out a bit, and current holders are probably holding their total bitcoins even, but that\'s just a guess. These companies are taking a microscopic amount of bitcoin in and converting to dollars, but the velocity of money is helpful long term for value (bitcoin gains value if you can spend it somewhere), but a short term problem for price (pushing it down a bit). So, merchant adoption is good long term, but price going up needs demand to exceed supply. Very tricky with bitcoin and early holders versus new demand and new places to spend it. It\'s constantly wobbling like balancing a frisbee on a broom while you juggle on a ball.\n* VC money is not going into Bitcoin, it\'s going into blockchain technology. The smart money invests in companies that deliver goods and services. Some like the Winklevoss have a bit of inventory that\'s probably gone up 1000% then down to only up 500% ($100/btc to todays $650/btc) - but the big money is not in the appreciation of buy and hold, but in taking percentages of the trade. So that\'s how VC companies think and for them a 500% gain is nice, but not something they are going to really base a business plan on. If they have bitcoin, it\'s as stock or inventory, and their real plan is usually to IPO - selling stock is like printing money. So they are looking for much much much larger gains (if you can believe it).\n* The Internet, email, and other technologies seemed to take off faster. This one will run into a lot of political resistance because it takes on sovereigns. Privatized decentralized money that\'s not under the direct control of a sovereign - well it\'s going to be about as popular as private armies, private police, private navy... a big maybe.\n* Wallstreet is not going to give you their money, they are coming to take your money away... well they are late to the party, but bitcoin is super tiny to them.\n\nNot my personal views but my fair and moderate version of the commentary :)\n': 10, 'tyvm, analysis has been quite good of late, eh!?!': 1, "Opinions and guesses are fine if labeled as such.

There\'s no reason for them not to do it, but there\'s also little reason for any given consumer to seek out bitcoin for payment in the first place.  It\'s the big bitcoin catch-22: if the infrastructure existed it might be great, but the process of bolting it on to the current world is forced and doesn\'t present a lot of appeal to people who aren\'t independently enthusiastic about the tech.  Credit/debit already works great.  The BTC:Internet analogy misses the fact that electronic use of money is already something people can do with a cost that\'s either minimal or else comfortably absorbed.  I have an online bank account, I have paypal, I have credit cards: BTC doesn\'t enable "the masses" to do things in a new and different way like the internet did. \n\n* Tech issues: rising popularity of bitcoin will expose the difficulty (impossibility?) of securing it.  Think about the target data breach: more users inevitably means more hacking/crashing/bugs.  A big "advantage" of the traditional monetary system is the ability to undo things.  Chargebacks might not be great for merchants, but our legal concept of money and securities as held by individuals and institutions provides real advantages over something irreversible and fungible like BTC.  There are pros and cons, basically, so I don\'t see it completely taking over.\n\n* Mining:  the gigantic jumps in difficulty mean mining is getting less and less decentralized.  Even the threat of a tech breakthroguh (or dedication to production) making bitcoin mining centralized in just a few hands (or even just one hand) makes me skeptical.  How much risk is there investing in something when you don\'t know who will be controlling/securing it at any point in the future?  Sweeping big issues like this under the rug to encourage adoption is always a little disturbing.\n\n* Distribution history: There are huge numbers of coins in the hands of early adopters that could shock markets.  I think that will make "smart money" hesitant to jump in with both feet, and if the price starts taking off, I think will make a lot of people uncomfortable (if you imagine bitcoin being a world currency and getting rich off of it, your central thesis is you\'ll obtain massive wealth by selling the world the currency it needs in the future, which might be a tough pill for those who would eventually be buying said currency to swallow - especially when the only "magic" thing about bitcoin was it being here first)\n\n* Fungibility:  I touched on this before, but bitcoin is not "limited" or "scarce" except by mass decision.  Anybody who wants to can start Bitcoin 2 (TM) and an exchange that allows for nothing but the swapping of BTC for BTC 2.  The mining proposition was actually more of an impediment in the past: with the tech runaway, the difference between the current network hashrate and the hashrate of somebody onlining some latest generation miners won\'t actually be that huge.  As long as crypto X is freely exchangeable with BTC, the "supply" of cryptocurrency is meaningfully increased, which I think will undo a lot of the justification of bitcoin. \n\nBasically, I still think bitcoin can "thrive" long term, but will do so as a niche and not a massive global thing that will require 5-6 figure+ coin valuations to \'work.\'  The price could easily jump up and drop down and go sideways and backward and forward, but I don\'t believe in a long term price point in the 5 or 6 figures (of course, I don\'t believe it will/should drop to zero, either)': 38, 'Great response. #2 especially.': 6, 'The same reason bitcoin lost half its value many times before: it is fragile and volatile.  The code itself is a risk, the mining farms that can 51% attack with seeming ease are a risk, and the unregulated exchanges are all huge risks.  I am short term bullish, long term bearish.  Unfortunately I think the losses will hurt worse than the potential gains.': 0, "Litecoin is almost a carbon copy of bitcoin, compared to newer alts. As such, it has all the faults and risks of bitcoin, while lacking bitcoin's biggest strength: the size of the ecosystem.\n\nThe reason we prefer gold to palladium, bitcoin to randomjunkCoin, american dollars to monopoly money, is that people participate in the collective delusion that other people find it worth money. With litecoin, the conviction seems to belong to a small group of people that is steadily growing smaller.  A group that notably seems to exclude venture capital and retail adoption.\n\nThere's no good reason litecoin couldn't have been huge. If the chinese had picked up on it before bitcoin, who knows. But I think the race has been lost, and the next contestant will be either a new altcoin that has real technical innovation, or (more likely) a coin sponsored by a large company that can lean on its own network effect to fight bitcoin.\n\n\n": 3, "I'm long-term bearish. There's a lot I like about BTC and I don't think it's ever going to 0, but I think it's already highly overbought. Here's why.\n\n* Ridiculously low user adoption. As in, almost no one is using it for non-speculative, non-gambling, legal uses. And the seller adoption is a paper tiger where coin is sold for fiat immediately. It reminds me of the hubbub around Second Life, where companies tried to show their tech chops by opening stores and then no one showed up.\n\n* Number of transactions is stalling. Compared to the growth of tech startups like uber, airbnb, or instagram, adoption is extremely slow. \n\n* No compelling reason for the user to prefer bitcoin to credit cards for non-anonymous purchases. I pay to use bitcoin, I'm paid to use credit cards. And I can reverse charges. And it happens instantly. Merchants decide what to sell, but the customer decides how they pay.\n\n* General user unfriendliness. I can send someone money through gmail, paypal, or facebook (soon) using their name. I can send it with a nice note to them. I get confirmation they receive it.  Long strings of gibberish have terrible optics.\n\n* Security issues. How much of the total market cap has been stolen at one point or another? And that's with a tech-savy userbase. Bitcoin is like a high-power car without seatbelts or airbags--and that's part of the fundamental design. The more you layer traditional protections on it, the more centralized and off-chain it becomes. At which point you lose to the credit card companies, because they have that game down.\n\n* 51% consolidation. Big money will never trust the blockchain with millions if it relies on also trusting an anonymous pool operator in china.\n\n* Hidden cost of transactions. Transactions are not cheap, they are paid for by the inflation of the block reward. It's like if VISA charged no fees but was funded by the US Mint printing extra dollars every day. Here's a good writeup: http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-01-02/bitcoin-is-an-expensive-way-to-pay-for-stuff\n\n* Carbon footprint.

I'm willing to spend BTC places I'd never let touch my name, let alone my credit card number. Automated services that take and send BTC are amazing, and I'm sure there's a lot of future applications I haven't thought about yet.\n\nSo I'm only mostly bearish about BTC; I think it has a valuable niche role. \n\nLitecoin, on the other hand...": 6, 'Wishful thinking, or predictive insights based on past velocity of innovation in computer and networking engineering?': 0, 'I meant to reply to the parent comment, actually': 2, '>However, posts like these seem unbearably smug to me.   \n\n>posts like these seem unbearably smug   \n\n>seem unbearably smug   \n\n>[unbearable](http://images.forwallpaper.com/files/thumbs/preview/51/516780__funny-bear_p.jpg)': 6, '1) For someone to buy things for bitcoin, they must buy bitcoin first.

The below figures represent the DAILY USD value of transactions combining all companies when assuming they convert X% of their revenue to Bitcoin transaction based revenue:\n\n* At 0.5%:  $310,959 per day\n\n* At 1.0%:  $621,918 per day\n\n* At 2.0%:  $1,243,836 per day\n\n* At 4.0%:  $2,487,671 per day\n\n\nNow, please keep in mind that every day there are 3,600 BTCs released into the wild via mining rewards, so that amounts to $2.34 Million per day at a rate of $650 per BTC.  Basically what I'm getting at is that until the conversion rates for these companies starts to branch up past 2 or 3% (bitcoin revenue vs total revenue), then they are going to have a smaller effect on the market than the daily mining rewards.\n\nAlso, I'm not even attempting to calculate how much of this negative effect would be counteracted by the original BTC holder/purchaser replacing his original BTC from USD after making a purchase with these companies.  Many people simply use their BTC to make the purchase, and then buy the BTC right back from the market with the USD they would have spent.  There's no good way to estimate how much that occurs, but just understand that this would minimize the negative effect of the companies immediately liquidating the BTC (but it definitely would not be a complete offset).\n": 6, "A little downwards price pressure in the short term, as someone waiting for NewEgg now gets to spend there.\n\nBut I think as a currency, using money increases it's velocity, so by MV=PQ means that in the long run, it helps.

In which case, everything is awesome !": 1, 'The risk is really just in the exchange, you can do by depositing money and lending using the autorenew.': 3, "roughly 0.17% interest per day. So 62%APR if you don't reinvest profit from interest back in.": 1, "I wrote a post in the BFX thread on BTCTalk in response to a question about insurance, I think it's worth reposting here. \n\nOne of the users was reasoning that the loans were 'insured' by BFX, and indeed they have made an announcement to this effect. However they simply don't have the funds to insure all 25 million in loans. The user argued that their ability to auto liquidate protects lenders, and in the worst case they would always roll back trades to protect lenders. This is dangerously naive.\n\nOf course they have ability to auto liquidate - it is a key component of margin trading. But there is no guarantee that prices cannot fall so fast that when the liquidation is triggered, they haven't already falling past the point where liquidating would recover the lent amount. In fact this has already happened once, on Feb 10 2014. In that instance BFX rolled back the trades, justifying this action by the fact that they had lost the additional liquidity of Bitstamp (I think they ran out of BTC on stamp) and that the cascading margin calls on the resulting thin order book would have taken the price on BFX to zero and wiped everybody out.\n\nBecause the price on other exchanges (ie Stamp) never went so low, but remained around the 500s, after a trading halt BFX were able to resume at prices that did not result in underwater margin positions, so the liquidations could be avoided. However, if all exchanges had tanked, this would not have been possible, and many margin positions would have been liquidated, possibly at a loss.\n\nThere is nothing preventing a similar flash crash to that of 10 Feb from occurring. Bitcoin is incredibly volatile as we have seen, and nothing is off the table. Reversing trades is not a panacea - not only that but BFX will only do it when it is in THEIR interests to do so. They rolled back trades in Feb because doing otherwise would have killed the entire platform - as Raphael said at the time liquidating every position in the platform and filling the orderbook down to zero.\n\nIn the case of a real, market-wide crash, don't expect BFX to roll back trades (how can they when the market has moved on without them?). And don't expect them to reimburse out-of-pocket lenders. They simply don't have the money to be able to do so, and their extremely vague promise to insure loans appears nowhere in the site terms and conditions or other binding contract. This would leave lenders to enforce such a promise through legal action (hint: google promissory estoppel), but then tell me, who do you sue? And where?\n\nI see the promise to insure all loans as motivated by two reasons:\n1) To remove the hassle of offering the (mostly useless due to extremely small pool size) optional insurance on loans\n2) Needing to justify their desire to capture a greater share of the lending business profits, aka GREED\nIt is not a promise that is backed up by anything.\n\nFinally, all this is before you even consider counterparty AND regulatory risk - there is still a very real possibility that something could go badly wrong at BFX, a hack, mismanagement, a court case, termination of banking relationships, government crackdown; the list goes on. This could lead to insolvency and loss of funds a la Gox and numerous other exchanges. This additional risk should not be understated.\n\nSo AGAIN: DON'T LEND (OR KEEP ON BFX) MORE THAN YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.\n\n": 4, "I've been doing exactly this with coinbase, but only with money I don't need access to immediately.

The platform is designed to reduce the risk of borrower default through a few mechanisms:\n \n  -  Pledged collateral with margin calls / auto liquidation: Borrowers must have some collateral pledged to act as a \'buffer\' against losses from a position. When this buffer or margin gets too low (20% of the margin remaining) you get a warning that you must send more collateral or risk being auto-liquidated. When the margin gets to 10%, your position is closed by selling the assets in the position at market price. The proceeds from the sale, plus the remaining margin, are then used to pay back the loan.\n\n  - Insurance on loans: BFX also used to allow you to purchase, for an extra 20% cut of your interest, insurance against defaulting borrowers, which guaranteed you against the above risk. Think of it as a credit default swap. Unfortunately the insurance pool was only big enough to insure a few 100k of loans! Because of this, a few months back BFX announced that they were scrapping the optional insurance but that we should consider all loans to now be "insured". However they admitted that they do not have the capital to fully insure all loans, and nowhere in the T&C is such insurance mentioned, so all we have is a vague (and legally unenforceable so worthless) promise.\n\n - Rollback of flash crashes: This is a speculative protection only, but many lenders seem to think that BFX have magical powers to undo any events that would cause a loss to lenders. This is because on Feb 10 2014 there was a flash crash, and in that instance BFX rolled back the trades, justifying this action by the fact that they had lost the additional liquidity of Bitstamp (I think they ran out of BTC on stamp) and that the cascading margin calls on the resulting thin order book would have taken the price on BFX to zero and wiped everybody out.\n\nSo you see that protections 2 and 3 here are mostly illusory.\n\nCounterparty Risk\n\nThere are a few flavours to this, but basically even by keeping money on BFX you are risking never getting it back. This could happen:\n\nMaliciously: BFX, a virtual company based in HK, could just disappear one day, with all funds. It\'s happened with plenty of other exchanges.\n\nNot maliciously, but through incompetence: They could get hacked, mismanaged out of existence, lose money though fraud or gambling with users funds, etc.\n\nFor reasons completely out of their control: They could have funds seized by government, get legislated out of existence, have all their banking relationships pulled, etc.\n\nSo there is also a lot of counterparty risk involved in keeping funds on BFX.\n\nHoever the interest rates are great, so if you\'ve got some money you can afford to lose, open an account with them, wire some funds, move it to the \'deposit\' wallet and make a lending offer!': 5, '> if someone can link it would be much appreciated\n\nIt\'s on the [announcements page](https://www.bitfinex.com/pages/announcements), posted March 16th\n\n> Removal of Swap Insurance Option:\n\n>We are eliminating the swap insurance options for traders offering liquidity.

The global money supply is the currency used in the 4 previously listed marked, not a market itself. \n\nSecondly, just stuff like using gold as a proxy metric for investment is silly. An index or a stock or a fund are all stores of value, which includes gold. Obviously it\'s tough to model a worldwide portfolio of asset invertebrate, but using gold is a gross oversimplification. There are a few similar examples. But great start obviously, better than anything yet': 2, 'I PLAY THAT GAME!!! :D \n\n': -7, 'he uses m1 or m0 which is not the right comparision.

I\'d categorize it the following way: Since the last bubble bitcoin knows basically 3 directions.\n\n1. (hard up) Ridiculous Spikes(those 700-1000 btc market buys we see when we enter another plateau)\n2. (hard down) Irrational hard dumps (those stacked 500 btc market sells we see when something pseudointeresting happens that is supposedly extremely relevant to bitcoin for whatever reason\n3. (soft down) slow bleedout down in low volume periods of stability/no news\n\nStrangely we never see slow organic growth upwards .\n\nThis leads me to the following conclusion (and I know people here are going to martyr and downvote me for this like always):\n\nConsumer adoption is actually not happening. Bitcoin is a speculative game largely influenced by whales/early adopters using their money to pump up the price or try to rationalize dumping by certain news. Most of these news hardly have any influence but because the market is entirely formed by speculation and no rational evaluation is being done people convince themselves that this news is a reason to buy while the other is a reason to sell.\nWe were at 800+ for quite some time, we went down and stayed stable at 5xx and 45x and now we are at 6xx again. What has changed? Basically nothing that would reflect such tremendous price jumps in a consumer driven, utility based market. \n\nWhile the long term direction of the asset "bitcoin" may be up, the short term norm direction is down. Reasons being constant sell pressure by miners and businesses accepting btc by offloading them through coinbase/bitpay. This strongly indicates that there is no sufficient consumer interest (for buying goods or as an investment) to keep the market constantly afloat or rising while the ones doing business in bitcoin are sure regular sellers that are relatively unaffected by the whale games. ': 4, 'The first block reward halving occured in december of 2012.

I started out super bullish based mostly on the technology, but also partly on the speculative prospects.

Trading coins are down, due mostly to an over-aggressive long that cost me a lot in swap costs (won't make that mistake again). But the real bright light has been my daily DCA buys on Coinbase since February. They've done very well on average, and there's something quite relaxing seeing your holdings slowly grow at about the same value & rate as the market overall. \n\nIf I had it to do all over again, I'd do less cold storage, more long-term swing trading using indicators like PnF that focus on trends not time windows, and a lot more DCA.": 5, 'Someone posted a chart like this a long time ago, i couldnt find it so i remade it.\n\nhttps://i.imgur.com/kgCweQe.jpg\n\nJust to keep things in perspective.
