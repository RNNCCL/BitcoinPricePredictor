But I doubt that increase would be dramatic, as simply paying the usual fee and wating a few blocks longer would still get it confirmed.\n\nI'm afraid there will be a more sudden tipping point, when blocks consistenly start being full, and transactions with the usual fee or a slightly higher fee don't confirm anymore at all, no matter how long you wait.

And as I look at the chart it looks like the jump up to $406 was pretty brisk.  I guess I missed some excitement.\n\nSo just and the last two moves were pretty \xe2\x80\x9crange\xe2\x80\x9d at 11 boxes up, followed by 11 boxes down, it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem like that can go on forever.  Here are the new figures:\n\nThe reversal of a column of Os would happen at $394.99.  This is exactly $5 lower than it is as I type.\n\nThe negative breakdown is a price lower than $370.   The price has bounced off that point twice now.  If we break down under $370 it might be a significant breakdown.  That would be a triple bottom breakdown.  That is not a good sign.\n\nBased on the last breakdown count of 21 boxes, it could break down to $300.  That would not be a lot of fun.\n\nThe break out signal is at $430.  Any breakout would probably be good for few boxes, but there is a ton of resistance right above the breakout point.\n\nThe formation is six columns wide.  Again, this is wider than normal for Bitcoin, but only one or two columns wider.  Remember, the last formation was ten columns wide.  When that failed to break a triple top, it pretty much fell like a rock.  Whether that was external matters or just the perceived value of the trade, the width of the formation indicated a pretty significant move when it happened.  \n\nMy prediction?  If you look at the big fall from the last major formation\xe2\x80\x94the one with the long pole breakdown warning, the price fell 21 boxes.  Usually on a long pole the reversal is 1/2 the pole.  That would make the reversal point around $400.  So, based on the start of this formation and its present position, we are currently 11-12 boxes up from the bottom\xe2\x80\x94right where we should settle down.  My guess is we continue with this formation around $400 for a while.  \n\nSince the trend is down, I would not be shocked to see us drop back into the mid $300s ($370-340) for a couple of days.

If the algorithm was such that it were economically unfeasible to build ASICS (as in chips optimised to run it) for it, then there would be a really organic path to upgrading and (if needed) to forking as a matter of routine, through the aggregated decision of thousands of individual miners mining on their own PCs and laptops.\n\nThe current PoW algorithm guarantees that the decisions in Bitcoin will end up being between the economic interests of two or three big players.

Once it moves in the direction of the column it counts.  Even if it reverses up to $385.  ': 6, "Another part of this methodology involves using point and figure charts to measure price objectives. That is, how much upward or downward potential has been built up in a given sideways range. It gives you price areas to watch for a potential change in character.\n\nTo answer your question, when there is a selling climax (a SOW) near an objective area, you know to cover your short and watch the relative strength of the next rally. Here the price may enter accumulation in preparation for a new uptrend, or it may redistribute sideways and build up more cause before resuming the downtrend. The important thing is to let the price build up a cause before a position is taken and watch for clues as the trading range develops so you can attempt to enter the trade near the end of it, or else you'll risk getting stopped out prematurely.\n\nSmall counts can add up to confirm large counts and this helps with timing. This is what happened with the summer 2014 distribution. It was a very large formation and its preliminary objective count went to $300-$340. The price climaxed out near $450, then redistributed for a month before finally achieving $300 in October. So that's where you'd cover, at that selling climax. Then it redistributed for three more months, building a new objective of $171. This confirmed a very large scale distribution count ($200ish) formed after the 2013 crash and was very close to the final low of the bear market. \n\nNot all distributions mean bear market gloom and doom. The March/April 2015 distribution is a smaller formation and therefore built a smaller cause (P&F count) downward. Also, the huge distribution count behind it (from early 2014) had already been realized at that point. In effect, the market used up that potential energy and needed to build a new cause before going anywhere interesting. \n\nSo, clear as mud, right? There is no easy way to know. P&F counting is an art and something I'm still trying to master, but can be remarkably accurate if you can really pinpoint where the important buying and selling is occurring within a trading range and combine it with other principles to make logical price projections.

Supposedly Classic will be released by then, but I doubt reaching consensus will be so quick. \n\nI think it's more likely that we do see a big drop while this blocksize debate rages forward. This will be THE drop imo. The drop where the truly faithful go all in on cheap coins and the weak hands get left in the dust. I think that process could take a couple weeks or maybe months, and then when a consensus is reached and the halvening is rapidly approaching, maybe we finally see a real bubble.\n\n": 4, 'It had to go down to that level to complete the expanding diagonal.

By the time the trading signal reaches the users, it's already impossible to enter at the price I've entered.\n\nI think you can fix this to some extent by simulating a market order instead of taking the last price. But it's not possible to eliminate the effects of the random walk that makes some strategies on the leaderboard appear profitable.\n\ntldr: platform monetizes of tricking users that a dice roll has a value, but users can't know this without years of experience.

Feel free to disagree if you've found an edge over the market that still exists when put into a stream format.": 1, 'Hi, thanks for your question :)  \nYes, we use the price from the last trade.  \n  \nOur simulated trades (opening and closing) and statistics, use the takers fee from Bitfinex (0.2%).': 1, 'How is the stream price defined?

It's free to publish signals and when a subscription is sold, 70% goes to the publisher (we only make money if the publisher does).\n\nThis makes it possible for anyone to make money in the Bitcoin market, even people that do not have the money themselves to invest.\n\nAlso, it gives a reason for traders to submit their signals and/or connect their trading bots.\n\nI don't know if this answered your question.": 3}, ('Poloniex loan rates.', 10): {"60 days is the maximal duration you set for you loan, but usually traders do not use loans for such long deals, more likely a trader will close the position in a few days. Don't pay too  much attention to this 60 days duration, this is just a limit.\nYou will get your interest when trader closes the deal. As I said above it is very unlikely this will happen after 60 days, more likely in a few days. Then your lending offer goes to the market again (if you have auto-renew on). If market rates for loans decreased by that time you lending offer will not be used immediately and will stay in open offers. \nThe interest is credited to your lending wallet, there is no auto compound.\nYou cannot cancel the loan while it is being used, you can just turn off auto-renew option.\nBTW, there is a help page about lending on poloniex site, quite small, but anyway https://poloniex.com/support/aboutMarginTrading/ (in the bottom)": 2, 'Thank you. I see the loans for 2 days or 60 days are offered for almost the same rate (https://poloniex.com/lending#BTC). This would make sense if the rates are shown for a constant period.

I must be an idiot and doing this incorrectly.': 1, 'Hey, thank you for such a detailed explanation. \nSo let say if i lend BTC to someone for 60 days will daily interest be credited to my lending wallet or auto compound? Daily or the end of 60 days? And question nr 2: Can they cancel loan before the 60 term? Will I get paid for whole period or only the number of days the load has been used? Thank you so much!': 1, 'I have experience in both taking loans for my margin trades and providing loans to traders, try to explain a bit more.\n\nThe lending is also a market with supply and demand. If demand for loans is increasing (like what we see during ETH pump, traders use a lot of BTC loans to buy ETH for their long positions) the loan rates go higher, when demand is decreasing the loan rates go lower. Very similar to trading.\n\nWhen trader opens a margin trade position he/she specifies maximum loan rate trader can afford, this is 2% by default. Then system automatically takes loans at current market rates. If there are no loans available below specified 2% rate then margin position is liquidated. There is no historical data for loan rates on poloniex, but I am sure the loan rate never reached 2%, it is actually a lot lower. Currently about 0.15-0.17% per day. And this still can be considered as quite high.\n\nWhen you offer a loan you specify the maximum loan duration. If you specify for example 2 days, trader takes you loan, then after 2 days system will automatically find another loan offer for trader (at current loan rates) and return you loan back to the market. If you think current loan rates are low and will grow soon (or just because you would prefer to have more control under you BTC) you can set a low duration like 2 days, so after 2 days you would be able to change the loan rate (or withdraw your BTC). If you think current loan rates are high you can set a long duration like 60 days and there is a chance you loan will be used at this rate for 60 days (if thing not go very well for trader and trader\xe2\x80\x99s position is not closed for 60 days).': 3, 'Look at the lending page.

Holy poop. First off, you can disregard "exclusivity of margin" when it comes to attracting new fresh bull forces simply because polo has had its margin implemented for months and theres nothing new here.

Dare to explain that? Im sure not. "hey, lets cook some tacko pumpage to make ppl post on reddit about huge sudden liftoff, then step back and let everyone tamper with their dumps on doge and bts cause whatever were doing here were always looking for lolz". Yeap, thats how it works. To summarize my point all the mentioned alts were driven by one or two individuals being instrumental in organizing the splash in several markets followed by mob panic and herdish instinct with no regard to fundamentals or real world valuation behind those alts.

I'm not blindly putting my faith in bitcoins, either, it's just that nothing Mike Hearn has said is new information, or was especially unpredictable. \n\nThe one fundamental truth about bitcoins are that they are a hedge against fiat inflation, and far easier to deal with than gold. Transaction volume is irrelevant to this. The big push for using it as a trading currency was to gain user awareness and mass adoption, and that is the only thing that transaction volumes really address. Even if it is not used as a trade token, it will always be useful against inflation, and nothing Mike Hearn has said has changed that.\n\nThe odd thing about all of this, is that the best trade tokens lose value over time, to encourage people to get rid of them (by spending them). Fiat is actually far better for trading economies than bitcoins ever will be, *because* of their inflationary nature.

Then factor in that people put all sorts of messages in the blockchain - I think some guy even uploaded a load of porn to it - and these scanners get slow scanning the millions of legacy messages in the blockchain *every* time a block is mined, and the miners resort to mining just the header of the block to collect their 25BTC and to hell with the transactions.\n\n>I agree that Chinese miners who don\'t include transactions will not get the fees. That makes them less profitable, that\'s my point.

But am not sure.

It's a pretty complicated issue but I'll try and give you an abridged version:\n\nA) The price had dropped from 380 range to sub 360 in around half an hour. Buying at the top of where the last drop began is a risky move. Remember, you want to buy because it used to be worth X and you see it going up rapidly; however, there are a lot of people who didn't sell, saw it dip below 360, and now want to gtfo. So sellers are going to be very heavy, while buyers are hesitant because it was worth 360 just a little bit ago. This is where a bit of psychology and thinking from the other side of the trade can come in handy. If you were holding, saw it go to 357, and can now sell at 378, would you? If yes, it's probably not an ideal time to buy.\n\nB) I look at RSI. If you go on bitcoinwisdom.com you can click on settings and choose RSI as an indicator. For quick trades I try to buy when RSI is low. Not everyone puts a lot of stock into RSI, but it's worked well for me.\n\nC) Rarely get in on the first leg up. If you look at the charts there is usually a swing up and down. Wait for the second or third time the price is increasing to buy in. It may cost a few dollars more, but it's more of a sure thing. \n\nD) Set entry and exit points and stick to them. This isn't my full time job. More often than not I'm busy with shit other than btc charts. When I first started trading, I'd miss my entry point on a trade, the price would be shooting up, and I'd try and make the trade work at the higher price. All of my big losses came from forcing a trade like that and then hanging onto it hoping it'd turn around. If you miss the entry. It's OK. There will be another opportunity. If its underwater, cut your losses earlier rather than later. \n\nBit of a discombobulated rant, but I'm tired and have had a few. Hope it helps.\n": 9, 'Buttcoin core?

I know some are skeptical, but this is just my opinion and what I believe it to work. I hope you guys don't mind if I repost in tomorrow's post if this thread gets rolled over in an hour or two.\n\n[Long term bitcoin daily price chart](http://ibankbitcoins.com/sites/default/files/users/user1/1-21-2016_chart_0.png)\n\nI will first go over the technical analysis and charting, then discuss my projections for the upcoming short term and intermediate term. Let\xe2\x80\x99s take a look at the chart below. Note, the support/resistance lines were drawn a while back and some still holds true today.\n\nBitcoin price has recently broken down from the steepest trendline with multiple support points. There were early warnings that a break down was likely. The Mike Hearn's article and TX backlogs caused some serious panic selling. The next trendline up is from a longer time frame. We briefly breached it but rallied above it so far. This line is also pretty steep so a break down wouldn't affect the longer term trend, but shows more short term bitcoin weakness.\n\nThe major support line is at 2340 which coincides with the previous spike high and the most recent crash. Above this support is bullish since it is the upper end of the trading range. In terms of moving average, the 200 day and 365 day moving average is way below the bitcoin price. I use this to gauge the general long term trend. We are a bit extended at these prices since the moving average is so far away from the price, but price can remain at these levels for an extended period of time.\n\nThe last and most important thing I want to talk about is Dow Theory. If you are not familiar, I hope you can read up on it online or a previous article I've talked about. In summary, Dow Theory suggests that a trend going up needs to form a higher high and a higher low and vice versa. Look at the red arrows on the chart; we have formed lower highs on multiple occasions on the daily chart. While it is not immediately bearish, it does show buying weakness. On the other hand, the market is also forming higher lows which confirm that we are in an uptrend. We have two conflicting signals, which bring me to my next point.\n\nIn the short to intermediate term, I expect further market weakness. We have conflicting signals in the Dow Theory which suggests bitcoin price might be in a choppy market. Since price is at the upper range of the trading range. I expect it to pullback further. I am still bullish long term since we are trending up. So unless trendlines and supports start to breakdown in addition to a lower high and a lower low, I would not change my long term price projection\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve covered a lot of TA stuff here, let me know what you think or have any questions.

Which reduces confidence in the network, initiating a panic sell off, which further reduces hashing power, and we enter a downward spiral.\n\nThe other side of the coin is that we successfully complete the 2nd halving, even without a significant price increase we will see confidence in the network surge and then eventually a price increase.

Bitcoin as it is designed requires higher protocol layers to handle a high transaction rate without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nAs an analogy, the base protocol layer for the internet, IP, is designed to route packets of data from one node to another over the Internet. That's pretty much it's primary mission. Making IP handle more than that would make it overly complex and prone to inefficiencies that would detract from its purpose. A second  protocol riding on top, TCP, builds on IP's basic functionality to provide stateful, connection-oriented communications.\n\nSimilarly, Bitcoin's base layer needs only to be reliable as a highly decentralized ledger system. Decentralization is the priority at the base layer, not volume. A higher layer, such as Lightning, can serve as a caching layer to handle a higher rate of transactions. Note that lightning is a transaction bundling scheme that uses complex Bitcoin transactions to make it work. \n\nProtocol layers are a well known design philosophy, and Bitcoin isn't somehow immune to it.

But I think there is going to be strong support down to that level because of the width of this formation.\n\nIf you are a bull looking at this chart, you would probably think we are going to start a new formation here, rising the the $450 area and then bouncing around some more.

I get it, but I need to do some more reading on it.

Not everyone looks at this on their phones all day.\n\nI do not think we break through the $410 area into a break down.  I think the consolidation over the past several days/weeks has been pretty strong and creates a base to move up in the coming months.

What would actually happen in this case is that they would set a precedent that the argument will just be endlessly extended.  I understand that there is a bullish case to be made that more users will use bitcoin, but when the 2MB blocks become full a few days after the limit increases, the discussion will just continue as if it never left off.  What happens then - another year-long debate that ends up with another one-time increase to 3MB or 4MB?\n\nMarkets hate uncertainty.  If adopted, Bitcoin Classic could usher in a new normal of brinksmanship.  Nobody will know if the next fork will happen, what the size will be, and who is going to upgrade.  The upgrades will be expensive and people will lose money through bugs or using the wrong fork every time.  The censorship and criminal attacks will continue, and altcoins will continue to threaten bitcoin's dominance.\n\nI find it difficult to believe that the market will take kindly over the next few months to such uncertainty, which is why I think that the experts who are saying that bitcoin will reach an all-time-high this year now need to reevaluate their price targets.": -9, "It's definitely newsworthy.

It relies on the api data which is fed into a redis server via pub/sub commands. The server starts, connects to redis and then subscribes to a bunch of channels, for the ticker prices. These prices themselves come from scripts which poll the exchange api\'s. These are written in perl. \n\nThe telnet server code is based on [this](https://github.com/Gladdy/Mininode) which someone recently released as an example of how to emulate nodejs with c++. I thought it was cool and wondered what I could use a c++ socket server for. So I went with a telnet price ticker.  \n\nI had to make some small changes to the code to add some mutexes to protect the socketVector object so that two threads wouldn\'t modify it at the same time. This was only really an issue under load and the author only released it as a poc, which is probably why it wasn\'t spotted. I keep meaning to submit these changes back as a pull request in case anyone else wants to use the code. \n\nIn all honesty though you would be better using something like [this](http://www.davidmclifton.com/2011/07/22/simple-telnet-server-in-node-js/) which I recently found. Much easier :-)\n\nAs for the vt100 emulation, you need to use the codes on [this](http://www.termsys.demon.co.uk/vtansi.htm) page. For example, clear screen is given as:\n\n    Cursor Home \t\t<ESC>[H\n\nWhich in c looks like:  \n    `const char moveHome[4] = { 0x1b,\'[\',\'H\',\'\\0\' };`  \n\nHiding the cursor looks like:  \n    `const char hideCurs[7] = { 0x1b,\'[\',\'?\',\'2\',\'5\',\'l\',\'\\0\' };`  \n\nSo you have to build these up. For example, move to a column and row number, write out some text, and then return the cursor to the home location. This is all achieved by looping through all the connected sockets and writing out the required commands. For example in the mininode code above:\n>    for(const auto &connection : connections) {  \n>    \t    \tif(connection.first != socket) {  \n>    \t    \t\tconnection.first.write("");  \n>    \t    \t\tconnection.first.write(cd.username);  \n>    \t    \t\tconnection.first.write(content);  \n>    \t    \t}  \n>    \t    }  ': 4, "While neither as exciting nor as nicely-formatted, I have created a bash script after having been inspired by OP's work.

If fees and confirmation times must rise so be it. They clearly believe (and probably correctly so it must be said, they are the experts I can't disagree) that the LN will solve these issues down the line. So from their POV, what's the problem? Why not just wait out this little bump in fees and confirmation times and develop LN?\n\n\nThis is controversial but here is what I personally believe..\n\nThe community doesn't REALLY care about decentralization. 99.9% of people reading this will have or have had considerable sums of money sitting in bank accounts. Completely centralized. Does this keep us up at night? No. Sure we ARE worried about an attack on bitcoin caused by centralization, but the simplest attack vectors are ALREADY very centralized. The development team being my #1 on that list.\n\nI think most people already know in their heart of hearts that Bitcoin probably will end up more and more centralized in the future. If bitcoin were ever to go worldwide huge can anyone see anything but the big banks being in control? (they will probably run the network at a loss and sell you other things, or charge the masses to look after their keys) Honestly if it were split between them I wouldn't lose any sleep.\n\nI think what people REALLY care about and why Bitcoin gained any momentum at all are the two below pulls,\n\n1) being in control of your own money 100% in a digital enviroment (digital cash)\n\n2) being able to transact this cash with 0 fees (it was always advertised as effectively zero fee albeit the small print word *virtually).\n\n\n\nIncreasing the confirmation times and developing an artificial fee market are what people really care about.

Supply will be halved. If this is the case and demand is the same there will be price increase.\n\nTwo points I'd make in response to that.  First, people buying bitcoins aren't competing to purchase the block rewards directly  from miners.  They buy in the marketplace from other sellers.  The volume of BTC transacted between buyers and sellers on US exchanges alone is now orders of magnitude greater than the daily block rewards.  People always fall into the thinking that the block reward halving is somehow like halving the supply of available bitcoins, but these are not the same things.  The available supply of bitcoins is whatever people are willing to sell at a given moment in time.  That supply is exponentially greater than the 3,600 (soon to be 1,800) that are mined everyday.\n\nSecond point would be that, in my humble opinion, it's a bit silly to worry about how many bitcoins are in circulation at this very moment when trying to determine a valuation for bitcoin.  Since the distribution schedule is pretty well laid out (obviously subject to slight deviations based on hash rate and how quickly blocks are solved), it would make more sense to just assume that all 21 million BTC are in play and perform any valuation analysis off of that assumption.  \n\nIn short, the block halvening should really only affect the miners bottom lines, as there will be less revenue to go around between them.  I can theoretically think of a scenario when the miners decide to hoard their block rewards to attempt to boost the price to counteract the lower revenue stream, but like I said above, that's still only going to be about 1,800 BTC per day, and there are exchanges that trade that level of BTC in seconds currently. The block rewards are going to have less and less of an effect on the bitcoin economy over time.  Just my opinion though, what do I know?": 4, 'I think it\'s an interesting perspective of the current situation.\n\nNothing is "broken".

So assuming I buy and sell them for relatively the same amount, that's not new money into the Bitcoin ecosystem, it's just changing hands. That make any sense?\n\nWhereas when newly mines coins are sold each day without the price moving much, the market cap increases. The market cap increases proportionally to supply v demand of new coins. When the supply goes down, the price must go up to balance the same demand.

If ever there were a time for Bitcoin, it is now.\n\nAnyway\xe2\x80\xa6here is where we are:  After the carnage of the past few days it seems we have developed a new rhythm, a new formation.  And that is good.  I do not know if \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin is Dead\xe2\x80\x9d but the other day was not the first time that has been pronounced.  Time will tell.\n\nWe are currently in a Column of Xs.  We reversed this morning.  We would have to drop below $370 in order to make this moot.  I am guessing that is not going to happen.  But it might.   This column of Xs will \xe2\x80\x9cbreak out\xe2\x80\x9d if we hit $395.  That is about $10 from where we are right now.  That seems the more likely direction.\n\nHere are the other important figures moving forward.\n\nWe would reverse at any price below $370.  If we do that today, it would make this column of Xs moot and we continue down the column of Os started over the weekend after the bounce.  If that happens after today, it would be another negative break down.  That would indicate price points in the $350 area.\n\nGood news is that for every column we add the long term trend line drops $5.  So we are already down to reversing the trend with a price over $445.  If Bitcoin is not dead; rather that this was just a huge shakeout, you should see $445 soon enough.\n\nAs I\xe2\x80\x99ve stated repeatedly, I am not in the prediction business if it is not seen in the chart.

My buy backs have been mostly in the $465-80 range.

Forcing yourself to achieve an arbitrary quota of profits no matter what\'s happening is not.\n\nSecondly, trading for a living and having to generate profit for living expenses is a whole different animal than flipping Bitcoins on the side. The stakes are much higher and there is constant pressure on you. While it is not mathematically impossible for an inexperienced trader to succeed, it is likely to cause a huge amount of stress and *will most likely lead to a catastrophe*.\n\nJust imagine the following scenario:\nBTC enters a lull at some price level at some point, while you are anxious to trade any move.\nYou\'re sitting there, maybe even with some losses, and Bitcoin just doesn\'t move well, chopping sideways for days or weeks on end. Not only do you want to "make back the money" (a dangerous mindset), but rent is due, you need profits. Haven\'t had a really good trade in weeks. You enter positions with no clear upside only to churn your account, because remember, you "have to" turn a profit. You start questioning yourself and desperation is starting to set in. Fresh losses are coming in. Maybe everything you achieved was down to luck, and luck only. There goes last week\'s profit. Maybe you have been wasting time and money, and everybody is else is just so much better than you. Maybe you have no idea what you are doing at all. \n\n[Nightmare scenario: you enter a big position to "make something happen finally", but things start moving against you. No, you are not getting faked out again and end up stopped out. It\'s sure to turn around. TA says so. It has just fallen through support. This would be a huge loss to take. It has to bounce and then you get out. Time to average down a bit. It keeps falling. You are close to margin call (/huge loss). **You can\'t afford this loss**. It keeps going against you.\n*The rest is up to your imagination*.]\n \nIf the above scenarios do not trigger panic attacks and cause crushing anxiety even in people not susceptible then I don\'t know what would. Inexperienced traders are bound to run into these. Every inexperienced trader will find themselves gambling, opening up dangerous, oversized positions with nothing to back it up, with only the desire to "make the money back" even if their livelihoods do not depend on it at all. Even veterans can fall into these traps if their emotional state is off due to outside reasons.\n\nMy advice, and this is for everyone new to this, would be to forget about trading for income for a long while. If you have money to spare and it really, honestly wouldn\'t make a difference if you lost it all then go ahead, take a dip. Trade on the side, build up experience, make the mistakes you have to make and learn all about the market and yourself. Avoid putting in more money to "make things back", because after a while, if you really figured it out, the account(s) will grow with you. There is no minimum equity level in Bitcoin, other than something above 0.\n\nOnce you have built up a big reserve of capital that would get you through the worst of years *and* you manage to turn a profit comparable to your other sources of income almost every month, then you can start thinking about doing this for a living. Keep in mind though, with trading you are, in theory, able to lose everything with only a few clicks in a matter of days. It\'s all up to you and you only. You are your own boss and your own safety net. All your weaknesses and vices will be out in full force to prey on you.\nYour career, education and work experience on the other hand could pay dividends for the rest of your life without risking it all.': 2, "Programming and trading can be stressful, which is why I don't do it for a career......

But such self-exploration is shaping not just your trading skills, it's shaping your mind, your spirit, yourself as a whole, to live a better life as a whole. The journey of a trader could be the same as the journey of a zen master. In your particular case, the path to become independent professional trader could be your cure for mental issues. But you have to bear in mind that it can go wrong, and your state could get even worse. So be careful. \n\nSo here is what I recommend:\n\n- acknowledge and accept that you won't be ready for full time trading in next 2-4 years, even when you work everyday on that. You have to be patient and disciplined.\n\n- educate yourself on psychology of trading, perhaps The Disciplined Trader by Mark Douglas would be fine for you.\n\n- visit /r/meditation and learn to meditate. Do that every day, don't get discouraged if you see no benefits in it after first few weeks. The brain needs to adapt to new patterns and that takes time. It's basically a study of self-exploration and that's exactly what you need, not just for trading, but to learn to manage your anxiety issues as well. Be psychonaut, but without drugs.\n\n- learn technical analysis, how to calculate risk-reward ratio, money and risk management. Exercise fundamental analysis and apply the technical analysis with regards to fundamentals.\n\n- get $50 or $100, buy some bitcoin and send it to huobi, btcc or okcoin.cn, so you get fee-free trading, that helps to keep you in game for longer. If you lose it, analyse your actions, try to find and correct mistakes, evolve, recharge your balance again with the same amount. Don't trade on leverage. Really, that would be counterproductive. Don't do that until you have made at least several hundreds of trades, and until you make profits consistently. Don't send bigger money to your trading account until you are making consistent gains for 6 months or so. Remember, the fastest way to get pro lies in patience and discipline, not in the size of your account. Greed is a killer.\n\nThere are people that successfully turned their motivation to resolve mental and living issues into life that is better than most us live. And it's not about money.

I recommend reddcoin to start with because their price is very steady, it doesn\'t fluctuate much, which means you can steadily sell teh amount you stake without depressing the price and also because they have a very friendly community which will help you in the learning process.

Not much changes, this debate continues to be very hypothetical and unimportant to most. 2: SHTF before Core upgrades, as in another bubble with a 1MB limit still, or wallet breaking changes to Core.

We\'re aware that trust is created with time and can be lost in a second.\n\n* We\'re basically pre-selling subscriptions in a way that you get the service as soon as you pledge, but the actual subscription doesn\'t start until after crowdfunding. So, not only do you get the service at a discount from the prices after the launch, but you get service for free for the next month and a half, or even longer if we postpone official "launch". There is also absolutely no obligation to continue your subscription after initial pledge; no automatic recurring billing with Bitcoin.\n\n* Pledges are done through Lighthouse. That means you can withdraw your pledge at any time and this is completely under your control, and we don\'t see your money until the funding goal is reached.\n\n* We are raising 17 bitcoins / $6460 by today\'s price, though, admittedly, as pledging is time-based this could overflow into another campaign. If we ran off with that amount, after providing service paid in the meantime, we surely wouldn\'t rank very highly on the [all-time Bitcoin scams list](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=576337).\n\n* We encourage pledgers to pledge minimum amount. The primary reason of this campaign is to gauge interest more than to raise the funds, so small pledgers are actually most valuable to us. Even though we strive to reward larger pledges appropriately.\n\n* Although you can pre-pay subscriptions for longer amounts of time and get a discount, we\'re completely OK if you pay monthly, thus risking only a couple of bucks at a time.\n\n* Pledgers risk is thus zero before the crowdfunding is complete, and afterwards, it boils down to getting only part of the service paid, but maybe not getting the reward in case we dissapear as soon as crowdfunding is complete. Of course, we do intend to ship rewards as soon as the campaign is funded, thus minimizing any risk to the pledgers.\n\n* If there is any other risk to pledgers (I can\'t think of any), or any concerns, please raise them and I\'ll address them.\n\nAs for identity, it\'s not like we\'re hiding it; just drop us an e-mail to crowdfunding@blockchainofevents.com  and you\'ll get response from a human signed with full and real name.

The past couple of days have been interesting and new to some folks.  \n\nAs Hyman Roth said in Godfather II, \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the business we\xe2\x80\x99ve chosen.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSo, while it pains me to post it\xe2\x80\xa6here is the chart for the day.\n\nClearly we reversed down a bit.  All the way down to $352.  Yes, the tea leaves said $360.  Anyone shorting from the $420\xe2\x80\x99s to my target should not be pissed that I missed it by $8 bucks!  ha Ha.\n\nAnd since we dropped to the new low today, this drop to the $350 box is confirmed.\n\nA reversal would happen if the price goes over $365 tomorrow.  It could go over that today (or it might have already, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t looked.  But it would not be reflected in the chart until tomorrow.\n\nA positive break out would be at $465.  Yes, it is going to take us $100 to break out until a new formation occurs.  So we will bounce around at this level and create a new, thinner formation.  That should settle things down a little from the shake out.\n\nThe current overall trend (long term trend) is negative.  It would take a move above $455 to change that back to positive.  \n\nThe current formations are a double bottom break down, which is not horrible.  We are also at a long pole warning.  This happens when the price drops below its breakout point by more than four boxes (which in this case is the drop from $400-$385) without a reversal.  Normally, the dead cat will bounce back up the pole by at least half.  So, a move up to the $400 range would not shock me at all.  It usually happens a lot faster than this\xe2\x80\x94so this level may be the new normal until all of this hard fork stuff is settled.  Some of which I understand, some of which I do not.\n\nI will admit that I liquidated some of my trading shares in the low $420s when it was starting to move.  I liquidated the rest of my trading shares when it hit $410.  I tried to play with the bounce yesterday, but I really suck at that.  I think in the end I netted about $40.  Not exactly a great effort.\n\nSo here is what I am seeing here:  I think we sunk pretty hard on news that scare a lot of people.  I am not sure we will see a recovery from that.  China\xe2\x80\x99s stock market is a mess.  I wonder how much of the activity we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen has to do with margin calls in the world wide stock markets\xe2\x80\x94both in China and the US.  The fact that there are probably a ton of margin calls for Monday morning (closed in the US) that we might see some more downward pressure.\n\nAn interesting support line comes from an older trend line that goes back to August.  That line falls into our column at the $340 level.  So right now I would say that $350-$340 is the support area.  $360 held pretty well.  THAT was the original target.  I am not getting too nervous about severe drops.  But I am not expecting to see $60 moves upward either.  (And by selling my shares, that is exactly what will probably happen!)\n\nMonday should be interesting in the rest of the world.

They are holding a significant amount of capital and one can easily imagine scenarios where they invest those funds in a riskier way for additional revenue, only to end up with losses. Whereas BTC holdings are (hopefully) fully under their control to a satoshi, client funds are sitting at third parties one way or the other. \n\nDepending on the severity, this can be anything from directly investing in losing ventures, engaging in (or lending out the money for) speculation, to the banks experiencing serious liquidity issues or bankruptcy, if things take a turn for the worse. Even in the best of cases, meaning they handle user funds appropriately, no exchange is completely immune from third party risk. Nonetheless, the chance of a Gox style meltdown goes up significantly if they commingle or abuse client money.\n\nWe do have examples of exchanges engaging in last ditch schemes to cover up losses, with some temporary success, only to go bust anyway.
