Let's see, you earn 100'000 cents/month, other people earn a 1'000'000cents/month and an apartment goes for 150'000 cents/month. Are you any further ahead now? No? How about satoshis?

Bitcoin isn't unique or uncopiable.\n\nMisunderstanding the network effect: Currencies have a network effect. The more people that use them, i.e. accept them, the more usable they become, and the more people will use them. Network effects are very powerful and they can lead to things like twitter, facebook, telephones, etc. The network effect is also what establishes reserve currencies.\n\n> Also, the number of coins is technically unlimited because of the divisibility thingy\n\nMisunderstanding divisibility/wealth allocation: A thought experiment, here's the rules:\n\n* There are only 2 people on the world\n* They use a currency, the USD\n* Between them, they own $100\n* They can't make any more USD\n* One owns $1 and the other owns $99\n* they engage in commerce\n\n$1 guy and $99 guy agree on a price for a commodity (let's say food) at $1. How much of their net wealth does each have to spend to buy this commodity from the other? The $1 guy has to spend 100% of their net wealth to get it, the $99 guy has to spend 1/99th of their net wealth to get it.\n\nThey now discover a way to use cents. Does this mean that food becomes 100x cheaper? The $1 guy certainly wouldn't be selling the food for 1 cent to the $99 guy, arguing that the other guy already holds the majority of the wealth, so he can afford the $1 sticker price. The $99 guy won't be selling the food the food for 1 cent to the $1 guy, why should he give a rebate to the other guy while he still has to pay the $1 sticker price?\n\nSo this shows us that, divisibility does not increase the monetary base, or affect the wealth distribution. The price is a function of the distribution of wealth relative to the monetary base. It doesn't matter if you count in $1 or 100 cents or satoshis.\n\n> See my thread about how Amazon could kill bitcoin\n\nA lot of people have not really understood economics.\n": 1, "Divisibility is only useful if the price is going to raise and a lot.

Im not saying it is impossible, but the key to stability is increasing the market cap, and we may enter a period where that has more or less happened.

I think $500-505 is more likely.  The April rally started at $425, peaked at $550, and stabilized around $490, meaning it kept (490-425)/(550-425)=52% of the gain.  Similarly, the early March rally started at $560, peaked at $710, and stabilized at $640, so it kept (640-560)/(710-560)=53% of it's gain.

Withdrawals to cryptocurrencies are usually so fast that most people are probably fine without that option.\nSo quite obviously, the goxing shows that fraud is much easier with fiat than with Bitcoin.

And hopefully the chart looks a little cleaner this time, I felt the last one got a little too cluttered. \n_______________________\n\n**Decreasing volume isn\'t an issue**\n\nPeople have been talking about volume recently, and they think it isn\'t enough to "kickstart" another rally. I think they aren\'t entirely aware of the developments that have happened in the Bitcoin space. Volume will always be decreasing in Bitcoin, because it is denominated in an asset that is continually going up in value, so people will be trading less of it as the dollar figure continues to rise. Add to this that, two years ago, Mt.Gox was the only exchange so of course they had the lions share of volume. Now we have Bitstamp, Bitfinex, BTCe, two major Chinese exchanges that, fake\\inflated volume or not, have stolen alot of the large market makers who were otherwise doing lots of volume on Mt.Gox. And additionally there are Bitcoin ATM\'s, local Bitcoins and a million other sites that probably add up to another major exchange worth of daily volume; so overall there is a much larger distribution which will make the volume seem like it is "trending" down.\n_______________________\n\n**You guys seemed to like yesterdays chart...**\n\n_______________________\n\nThis rally we have been on is quite similar to the previous two recoveries too. The same 5-wave pattern from the peak, and the same extra strong recovery afterward. We currently are entering the "stability" period where Bitcoin needs to maintain a level price point for several weeks to provide a great launching pad for the bubble. Critical times require critical measurements, hold strong folks.\n\nAdditionally, as the liquidity increases in the markets and the economy grows, I think the "bubble pattern" will break it\'s 235 day cycle and start slowing down, along with volatility slowly decreasing over time. We see this in my chart with the time spans on the bottom. This is why the current phase seems to be "behind schedule" to many, but I\'m not worried. As long as we continue the next few weeks with a solid launch platform, we will still be in excellent conditions for a bubble launch.\n\n**[Triple Comparison of the last 3 recoveries](http://i.imgur.com/khsBncr.png)**\n\nhttp://www.tradingview.com/v/5G67X1xt/\n\n_______________________\n_______________________\n\n\nAlso, on a side note, my first ever prediction on trading view just hit it\'s target!

Most of the times people trade on centralized closed source systems that are kept VERY opaque. There seems to be little drive from the community to change that, so all said it is very hard to say definitely what is 100% real.\n\n3) Depends on how close to the current price this is - if I for example set up a buy wall for 1 million BTC at 0.001 USD, this likely won\'t influence the price much - if someone suddenly posts a buy offer at 570 USD for 50k BTC it might drive the price down a bit (some will likely try to "test" it, to see if it is just an error or if they are really buying at that price, it might be possible to profit from that though. Just remember that others out there also have the same or VERY similar information about this and it can either turn in a self fulfilling prophecy (everybody buys because everybody expects others to buy too) OR horribly backfire.': 3, "Or, like we have seen alot in the last week, they are bid walls that ride the front of the orderbook pushing the price up and forcing other people just to market order and push the price up. It's effectively pumping the market and most of the time it works well. Also, those bid walls are entirely fake and will be pulled the moment momentum runs out.": 2, "It has many use : \n- price moves, sometimes really fast, there is bunch of people who just buy/sell at instant price (or place bid/ask at near actual price) and those who put several prices with sometimes more than 100$ range with actual price. In this case, if price move more tgan 100$ they got their order executed even when sleeping. \n- psychological : sometimes when you want to make the price drop some pips, you can put like 300BTC on sell order at 600 for exemple. In this way, other traders see that 600 range will be hard to break, and than can change your strategy. \n- strategy : for exemple, spoofing, is a kind of strategy when this walls are fake walls. \n\nIn fact there is so much reason between normal act, strategic act, manipulation act that occurs to make these walls. \n\nIn fact bid/ask wall are the sum of all traders order + people who has a big amount enough to make change on the market.

This means you decide for example that you are willing to pay 600 USD per BTC and put up a huge limit order at this amount. Anyone who still wants to buy BTC has to bid higher than you now or wait until your 1 billion has run out.\n\nThe opposite would happen if you are Satoshi and have >1 million BTC to suddenly sell. If you put up a sell wall, you are essentially setting a ceiling price that either pushes prices down further (since everyone who sells has to sell below your price or wait) or at least takes some time to be filled.\n\nIf you look at http://bitcoincharts.com/markets/bitstampUSD.html at the order book part, you see how these orders usually get rendered (the chart that looks like a valley/canyon).

A few thoughts:\n\nThe fundamentals of bitcoins\n---\nThere was quite a bit of discussion yesterday about the bubble cycle and why it wasn\'t disrupted with those Mt Gox allegations.  The reason is that Mt Gox was not one of the fundamentals of bitcoins.  I maintain that the cycle of bubbles will continue until one of the fundamentals changes.\n\nWhat are those fundamentals?  I tried to create a list:\n\n* Bitcoins are not able to suppressed by a government\n* In the case of perfect security, it is impossible to trace the ownership of bitcoins\n* The transaction fees are significantly cheaper than any other method of sending money\n* There is a set amount of money and nobody can create more\n* The SHA-256 algorithm does not have a significant number of collisions\n* Nobody has figured out a workable method of factoring large numbers\n* Development of the protocol continues at a good pace\n* The engineering team does not get stonewalled by disagreements between the developers\n\nNotice that **none** of these fundamentals has anything to do with political actions by banks, and most of them are technical.\n\n\nWhat I\'ve been predicting\n---\nThat brings me to clarifying what I\'ve actually predicted, and what I cannot.  Here\'s what I actually predicted about bubbles:\n\n* There will be another bubble, and it will occur around the same interval as the previous bubbles\n* The bubble will crash, just as the previous bubbles have\n* The price is responsible for and required for all the other things that happen, like developers building stuff and the way good or bad news happens\n* Companies are not interested in using bitcoins until the price is above a certain threshold\n* Good or bad news that is unrelated to the fundamentals is irrelevant to the price; any news would have caused the same price movement at that time\n* The market is heavily manipulated and the Mt Gox manipulation, if it was manipulation, was a drop in the bucket\n* It is nearly impossible to make money in short-term daytrading\n\n\nWhat I am not willing to predict\n---\nThere are also some people who have ascribed too much to me.  I am not willing to predict that the bubble cycle will continue past the upcoming crash.  The reason is that the 1MB transaction limit affects several of the fundamentals I described in the paragraphs above.  For example, the 1MB transaction limit could make bitcoins more expensive than existing bank-based methods of sending money, eliminating their usefulness for the remittances market - so that we end up with banks (yet again) sending huge numbers of bitcoins in bulk between them.\n\nThe 1MB transaction limit is a singularity that we cannot see past, like the event horizon of a black hole or the sort of event that Ray Kurzweil predicts.  The idea of a singularity is that there is such a change that it is impossible to predict what will happen on the other side.  The limit affects everything about the future of bitcoins and will determine things as basic as whether bitcoins will be limited to a protocol to transfer huge amounts of money between banks or whether everyone can continue to use them.\n\nPeople who are saying that I predicted that the cycle will continue indefinitely are wrong.  I only predicted that it will continue until there is a change in the fundamentals.\n\n\nIt\'s not cool to make fun of technical stuff\n---\nFor some reason, our society has developed so that people can gain social proof by making fun of people who employ deep thought or discuss things that require some effort to understand.  This annoys me, and I nearly lost my patience this weekend.\n\nSome people at a Memorial Day party wanted to know about bitcoins.  This happens often, and to me it demonstrates that people are fascinated by the idea of a currency that has sprung up out of nothing.  After several people asked the same questions, I told them I would take a presentation I have that takes about 90 minutes, reduce it to about 15, and give them the basics.\n\nFor those interested, I\'ve given the 90-minute presentation enough times to discover that there are several issues that are not worth covering if there is limited time.  For example, I never mention mining when referring to bitcoins.  Mining is a distraction; people always ask how they can start up their CPUs to mine, and while I can explain that, the hash algorithm is not important to know in order to understand the importance of bitcoins.  It\'s also not worth discussing topics like Mt Gox or the dark markets given limited time, because they are also unrelated to the technology.\n\nWhen you explain bitcoins, there are always three types of people.  10% of the people in every group get amazed and want to ask questions long after the presentation is over.  They understand that bitcoins are the future.  Some ask how they can buy bitcoins.  Another portion of the people listens intently and then doesn\'t talk about bitcoins again afterward.\n\nBut there is a third type of person who always tries to interrupt the presentation with rude or denigrating comments.  Every time you mention something that requires some thought, like the idea that I encrypted a 75-bitcoin wallet using a 64-character password, or that the network processes 80 quadrillion operations per second, these people laugh or make rude jokes and degrade the experience for others who want to learn.  It is not a complicated concept to see why it is necessary to practice extreme security for extreme amounts of money.  I wonder where it came to be socially preferred to appear dumb.\n\n* I edited this comment to add that there is another type of person: people who are not involved in the presentation, but who walk by and shout things like "enough of this, it\'s time to eat," or "we can all get rich after we go out there and have our cigar" and so on.  People who want to leave can stand up by themselves and do so; they don\'t need someone telling them when they are hungry, and people who are interested in the presentation aren\'t interrupting the other people who want to do other things.\n\n\nOther\n---\n* Some people criticized previous posts for being too long, but they received 50 upvotes.  I write a lot because I think that it is important to give the supporting evidence for things that I say, and I\'m not interested in saying things without explaining them.  If the posts start getting downvoted, then I\'ll leave, of course, but it\'s easy enough to read others\' posts instead if you aren\'t interested.\n* **Days until July 24: 57**': 92}, ('A massive sell on June 1st will signal the beginning of the next bubble.', 56): {'the term "smart money" is used by fools.': 0, '[deleted]': 5, 'As they say in Thailand " same same but different" ': 4, 'Good call...

However, it is still there for a reason, and that reason is that Bitcoin is not particularly scaleable (in its current form), and while we have never actually *reached* the block limit (or even come close) the 1 MB limit is a good approximation of where Bitcoin\'s scaleability problem becomes a real burden for the network with current technology.\n\nIf you have two people and you want to send 1 MB worth of transactions, and then a 1 MB block of confirmed transactions between them, bandwidth or storage is no problem. If you have 6,200 people (approximately the number of Bitcoin nodes) and you were perfectly efficient, you could get by with collectively sending ~12 TB of data. Its a lot for every 10 minute interval, but certainly not impossible, even today.\n\nBut what if you want that network to be redundant, self healing, and resistant to attack or "bad actors" in the network? You can\'t just send the data out once to each node, you must have some level of redundancy, and so each node will broadcast each transaction (and then the 1 MB block of confirmed transactions) out to at least several other nodes, and receive several identical copies even after they already have one. The more "rebroadcasts", the less efficient the network, but the more resilient. However, more rebroadcasts use up a ton of bandwidth and becomes expensive, leading to fewer nodes and centralization of the network.\n\nYou can see how even 1 MB sized blocks would use up enormous bandwidth across the network even with small amounts of redundancy... However, 1 MB block sizes only provides a transaction speed of ~7 transactions per second. Visa processes up to ~2000 transactions a second, corresponding to a blockchain size of ~285 MB *per block*. This level of transaction volume in Bitcoin would be a significant burden on nodes, and would consume massive amounts of bandwidth between nodes even if there were only a few hundred of them and very little redundancy.\n\nFurthermore, while the blockchain\'s current size is about 20 GB, at a constant rate of 7 transactions per second, the chain would be *growing* at 50 GB / year. (again, difficult, but not infeasable with current technology). At Visa levels of transactions, that growth would be ~14 TB per year, which does not lend itself to individual users keeping a copy of the blockchain running on a local machine altruistically to help the Bitcoin "cause" and promote decentralization.\n\nGenerally, the solutions to the scaleability problems are centralization and off-chain transactions (as you point out in your comment #3), but then what is the fundamental benefit over other third party services like Visa or Paypal? There are some potential software changes that could help curb the growth (or community based "checkpointing" that allow previous transactions to be archived), but there isn\'t really any solution to the problem of decentralized payment processing being highly inefficient. Think of it this way: most distributed computing networks break up a process and run each part in parallel. Bitcoin however *replicates* the same work across each distributed node because it is trustless. This means that as the network grows, there is no efficiency gained, only more nodes replicating the same work which need to be kept in contact (at some expense to the network) with "n" other nodes to maintain resilience against attack. \n\nAs Bitcoin\'s network grows in size, it gets more robust as a decentralized system, but *less* efficient. High transaction volumes may therefore force it to move away from a decentralized model and towards options such as in-house transactions, with a few (corporate?) entities that can afford to run nodes in order to keep the network running, which allows them to run the services that they profit from.\n\nSo, the block limit (and other parameters like "minimum fees") are there to help prevent the network from growing in size too quickly until some technology (or the software) advances to the point where it could handle larger transaction sizes while remaining robust and decentralized. If the limit remains in place, fees will rise until enough transactions are prevented to keep the network below 7 transactions/second. If the limit is lifted without some other solution, it will likely lead to centralization of bitcoin, requiring users to trust the motivation and actions of centralized entities that can afford to keep the network running at great personal expense.\n': 75, "It's basically a Y2K problem.

It\'s the same concept.\n\nThis community seems to think that knowledge of an upcoming bubble just speeds up the process.  While that certainly could be the case, I don\'t think that is a foregone conclusion.  \n\nI would also argue that while that may be true from a duration standpoint, it puts great restrictions on the overall size of the bubble that can occur.  The people that know about it are likely to play it MUCH safer than investors that are unaware.  During the crazy manic run-up phase, as we pass each milestone in value an investor that is well aware of the bubble cycle may be much more apprehensive to let profits ride, taking on average more out of the system than an investor that is completely unaware.  \n\nI don\'t think that anyone is arguing another bubble won\'t happen eventually... it really is just a question of how big.  Investors here I think would be VERY cautious over $5k based on projections from moral_agent and the like.  Someone who isn\'t aware of the previous trends as intimately as we are may be more likely to get emotionally caught up in the craziness and push the price to further highs which are much more unsustainable.  Since at the end of the day, that\'s what a bubble is right?  To me a price of $5k is wildly unsustainable right now given current market conditions.  I\'d be really scared of letting a price of $5k / BTC ride in a chance to see another $1,000 in price rise.  Based on previous data, you best believe I\'m cashing out.  \n\nIn short, once we stop believing in the bubble cycle is exactly when a speculative bubble can come along that truly the majority couldn\'t have predicted.  Look at traditional investments... they don\'t call out Bubbles forming years in advance.  Even though it seems "obvious" to some, and occurs naturally, nearly every time the majority of investors are caught with their pants down.  Seriously, nearly every time.  \n\nThat isn\'t just a coincidence... it\'s the lack of skepticism of the sustainability of prices among the majority of investors that makes it happen.\n\nEDIT: I always wanted to point out that here we tend to simplify choice making when we talk about modeling investor behavior.  We seem to think that it\'s as simple as if X happens, an investor will do Y.  It is always much deeper and more complicated than that, a perfect analogy being a Keynesian pageant.  Investors aren\'t JUST acting on price data and history, they\'re also acting on what they think every other investor is thinking, and what they think every investor thinks that THEY think.

It established correlation. Assuming Markus was a bot, how do we know that it wasn\'t programmed to increase the frequency of buys when the market price/volume was going up? If Markus was a human, then it\'s even more plausible that this human strategically placed entries into the Gox DB during periods of high volume - when they would be much less conspicuous. Being inconspicuous is generally a good idea when you\'re up to no good.\n\n2) Everybody keeps saying that the bot was only 7% of the volume. They\'re wrong. It\'s even less, because Gox was one of many exchanges.\n\n3) The price went up across all exchanges in relative synchronicity. In many cases, it went up on exchanges other than Gox (eg, Huobi) first. Gox wasn\'t the market leader in many situations during the bubble.\n\n4) Bubbles happen in almost every market, even mature ones. Now people are saying they won\'t happen in bitcoin anymore. It\'s crazy to think bitcoin has somehow become immune to this. Bubbles are driven by psychology, and that hasn\'t changed. People see a price going up, and they get exited. They see it going down, and the panic. It\'ll stay that way until the day that we swap out our brains with emotionless computers.\n\n5) Gox is over and done with, and when it collapsed, there was a rather large crash. For months, the price threatened to collapse further at the smallest hint of bad news. And the news coming out of China, mixed in with the bad taste everybody still had in their mouths from the collapse of Gox, was pretty dismal. Yet somehow people still thought, in that market, that bitcoin was worth at least $300. That tells me something: that today\'s price is no longer influenced by Gox. That we\'ve hit despair already, that the price has already corrected in Gox\'s absense, and we\'re well on our way to making our own roads from now on.\n\n6) I tentatively believe everything I just wrote, but it all rests on one perhaps questionable assumption: that nobody else is also pulling a Gox. Kraken and Bitstamp seem trustworthy enough (and they\'ve verified their solvency).

The net effect was a steady upward push, not enough to singlehandedly account for the bubble, but enough to make the market more "bubbly." What should have been a flat market post-Silk Road became a bull market, irrationally stimulating emotions and exacerbating other bubble-drivers like China.\n\n2. Remember that price lies on a curve, and in a bull market, it becomes inelastic as people become unwilling to sell. Linear changes in demand can cause exponential changes in price. If Willy had the effect of keeping the supply of cheap coins bought up, then actual bull events like China entering the market create much greater spikes in price than they otherwise would.\n\n3. I do believe that post-Willy, Bitcoin has already found its new equilibrium price and has entered a bull phase, so this news shouldn\'t negatively impact the market.\n\n4. Willy had the effect of making the market more volatile than it should have naturally been. The December spike simply wouldn\'t have gone as high without Willy artificially driving demand. Technical analysts should take that into account when attempting to predict the next bubble.\n\n5. Maybe i missed it in the article. EDIT: no maybe about it. ~~but i don\'t think we know how long Willy was in operation. Bitcoin has shown an oddly predictable pattern (~234 days IIRC) of bubbles. It is conceivable that Willy is programmed to execute, for example, X days of buys and then Y days of sells, and has led the market on its bubble cycle for some time. If true, the possible good news is that Bitcoin\'s measurable history of extreme volatility may be quite overstated. We could be entering a new era of more stable / less terrifying prices.~~ [EDIT: interestingly, this most recent shift from bear to bull market seems to be happening right on schedule, but is also post-Willy, so take that as you will.] \n\n**TL;DR:** 7% is significant and could definitely turn what should have been a bump in price into an irrational bull run; negative repercussions have already been priced into current prices; Bitcoin is perhaps less volatile than we have been assuming from the data; future TA should consider that previous bubbles may have been overstated in the data ~~or could even be wholly inorganic.~~ EDIT: but do not seem to be wholly inorganic.': 29, "The suggestion being that because Willy only bought, his volume was much more effective at raising the price because it pushed the supply/demand in only one direction?\n\nOkay, yeah.

Keep in mind, if he bought all of them, volume would drop sharply for the very reason you mention: no more recirculation through the exchange.\n\nBut let\'s assume that Gox was almost completely controlled by these accounts (which some people believe was an API for high rollers). If that\'s the case, what of the other exchanges? They had a large part to play in the market price as well.\n\nDuring the bubble, China was leading the market quite often. Not always, but enough that "China waking up" became a meme. The price generally made big moves during China\'s daytime, and price movements on other exchanges often lagged slightly behind Chinese exchanges.\n\nAlthough it\'s unclear how tainted Gox was by Willy, I think the bubble itself was not overly influenced by it. Gox\'s price was long divorced from other exchanges - higher than it seemed it should be. Now, perhaps, we know the real reason why.\n\nAnd about that idea that Willy was an API for high roller investors...
