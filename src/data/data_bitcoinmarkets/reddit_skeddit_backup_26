Then when someone wants to short BTC, the exchange matches that person with the people loaning BTC... The exchange automatically sells the loaned BTC, giving the borrower cash, and at a later point the borrower will have to buy BTC to repay the loan. Hopefully the price of BTC drops, then the borrower will have cash left over after returning the loaned BTC, so he profits.

Keep in mind though that there's a development lag.  As a miner, you have to invest into R&D, you have to build an ASIC farm, secure loans, secure buildings and equipment, all of these things take time.

Sometimes they overshoot, sometimes they undershoot, but the point is that price (or expected future price) is at the core of their decision making process.\n\nIf price gets too low, such that the variable cost to produce a coin goes below the market price for too long, then hash rate leaves the network, or gets replaced by more efficient ASIC technology.\n\nBased on what I'm saying, you cannot use difficulty to predict price, rather you can use price to predict future difficulty, after factoring in the expected efficiency gains between current ASIC hardware and the hardware still in development, and also a margin of error for development lag / faulty manager predictions.": 20, ">The higher the price goes, the more valuable block rewards become.

Then that is balanced against the amount long-term hodlers put in daily, smoothed and scrambled by the day traders, and results in the price trend. \n\nThe interesting question is what happens when the price falls so low that the fraction of btc mined and immediately converted to fiat reaches 100%. Then you\'ll see the price dropping until the amount put in daily by hodlers is sufficient to pay 100% of that cost. For example, if there are 10000 hardcore enthusiasts putting in $1000/year on average, the price will be around $7.6 (`(1000 * 10000) / (3600 * 365.25)`).\n\nThe hashrate will also drop until there are only so many miners who operate on that amount of cash daily.

But just because you make $5 million a year instead of hundreds of millions a year like NASDAQ doesn't absolve you of the responsibility. In that way, it is a fair comparison.

Because YOU won't get in on the ground floor of the ETF IPO. Neither will I. But we can buy bitcoins now. All the ETF does is bundle bitcoins in a trust, and investors can buy and sell shares of that trust.

During a really serious rally RSI will be crazy pegged and stay pegged but this was just a nice elevated rise, not some crazy rally flying through resistance.

": 1, 'Yes, effectively they are the same point, but your way of saying it makes the bears sound like hypocritical chicken littles, which is unfair to them.  I feel like you are distorting what they are actually saying.\n\nThey have a very valid point.  We are still currently in the downtrend that began in June-July 2014 (and ultimately began in December when we came down from the all time high).  Until we break that downtrend, this is still a bear market, and the prevailing trend remains downward.\n\nThere\'s a reason that the saying "The trend is your friend" continues to exist and propagate in finance.  Trend channels tend to hold for extended periods of time, and it\'s easy to recognize when a trend channel has been broken.  Many people get burned by trading against the trend.  A very important concept for investors to learn, understand, and (most importantly) actively practice is that you do not have to hit the sweet spot in every trade you make.  You can\'t time a bottom.  You might call it and be right, but much of the time you will be wrong and you will pay dearly for trying to catch a falling knife in a bearish market.  Trading with the trend is one way to practice the concept I\'m talking about.  When the trend channel is broken to the bullish side, investors should feel better about returning to a longer term bullish trade because the market will have signaled that the trend is changing.  \n\nTL:DR - The cautious pessimism of the bears is a healthy thing at this stage, and any bullish trader should balance their own views against the bears right now to arrive at a more moderate viewpoint.  The bulls can have their day in the sun when the current trend is broken to the bullish side.\n\nEdit: And just for clarity I\'ll discuss where I feel like the price would need to get to in order for this down trend to truly break the trend channel.  The breakout price depends greatly on what points and time frames you use, but the major break points I\'m seeing are around $415, $510, and $565.  Granted, those figures will decline as time wears on and the upper ranges of the trend channels continue to move lower due to their negative slope.  But I will feel successively more bullish as we hit each of the 3 price points I mentioned above.': 5, 'almost there.': 4, "Today's [Bubble-watch](http://imgur.com/a/o8sU6) ...

This primed the media buzz fuel pump in the USA and to a lesser extent, in Europe. Many tech-centric people who had heard only peripherally about Bitcoin in the past took notice of the price and were surprised to find how far it had come in price.    \n\nSecond, the spark that ignited the main bubble booster rockets was [the story that you could not get away from for a week](http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/oct/29/bitcoin-forgotten-currency-norway-oslo-home) about the journalist in Norway who bought $29 of Bitcoin in 2009 to do a story on it and 'forgot about it' (sure...) until he discovered to his joy that he was now a millionaire.

This depends on where their hardware is in its life cycle.  If it is no longer productive, miners are forced to sell BTC for new hardware or accept a smaller hash share and therefore lower pool returns. \n\nBut if their hardware is still fresh, some miners will instead choose to wait until their BTC becomes more profitable before re-investing in new hardware, and hold back some of their coin.  Since mining is an arms race, they know their competition with older hardware is being forced to dump BTC at a loss in order to keep scaling up on today's hardware.  When BTC starts to become unprofitable to mine, it hits hardest those with oldest miners, so those with new miners can play this to their advantage.  It's like punishing the competition by proxy, a kind of financial cold war.\n\nIf the price is doomed, then better not to reinvest in unprofitable hardware, but instead pause and wait a bit to let the market figure itself out.

Bitstamp doesn\'t provide this info in it\'s API, so different apps have to guess. An easy approximation is to just look if the transaction price is higher or lower than the last one. This is often correct, but sometimes wrong. A more correct approach is to check the transaction price versus the best bid / best ask price in the realtime orderbook. Even when doing this, sometimes you can get a transaction price in between those if the "realtime" trade API updates faster than the  "realtime" orderbook.\n\nIn your own application, put timestamps to each trade (take the timestamps from the API).

There are many proven use cases, and its almost guaranteed that worldwide adoption of these use cases will grow. However, it could take 3-5 years, maybe even more that we can speak of a wider adoption beyond niche segments.\n\nI think today many smart people, including those in finance industry got the fact that how big bitcoin will be. Plus we have some bigger holders, who stepped in early on and have immense resources to manipulate. \n\nBasically, I think the race is on to grab most coins as cheap as possible.

Push out small traders, enthusiasts, those who are trading on margins etc. \n\nEventually, market would correct the price, and it would inflate once again.

For example, when a buyer sends me an SMS in the morning that he is looking to buy 200 BTC, how do we determine the price? I introduce him to a seller and they work out a deal, usually a certain % under the current Bitstamp price. Why? The buyer is usually buying for his own holdings, reselling or something.
