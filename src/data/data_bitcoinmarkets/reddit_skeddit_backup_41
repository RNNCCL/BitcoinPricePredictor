The way that Bitcoin handles this problem is with the blockchain, where transactions take ~10 minutes to confirm and ~1 hour before they\'re confirmed beyond a reasonable doubt. Many services require six confirmations before your transaction is considered valid, whereas others are happy with three. So you broadcast your transactions to the network, and 30-60 minutes later your transaction is confirmed.\n\nThis sort of setup obviously doesn\'t work for trading. You want to place a trade and have it go through immediately. You don\'t want to have to wait 10 minutes or more for your trade to get into a block, nor 30 minutes for it to be reliably confirmed. Nobody can trade like that. Trades would get rolled back every time there\'s a blockchain fork, and it would be impossible to figure out what\'s going on.\n\nThe entire point behind trading is for a) transactions to happen near-instantly, and b) for there to be some way to determine algorithmically which order trades happened in.

After all, the number of bitcoin addresses (in use or otherwise) is more of a metric of money flow within the system, rather than a metric of adoption.

': 2, 'Obviously they should be called MauledByPorcupinesBands.': 2, 'OK, then a few things:\n\n- It seems obvious to me that repeated differences will always lead to something that\'s stationary, so that this method will never fail to discover stationarity. You mention calculus, but DSP seems a better way to understand it: when you take a two-point moving difference, you\'re just convolving with the vector [-1 1], which means you\'re just high pass filtering it. If you repeat this process, it means you continue to high-pass filter it until enough low frequencies are gone to declare that whatever you\'re considering to be "drift" has been eradicated, and hence the result is now "stationary." At that point you might as well just apply any minimum-phase high-pass filter to the signal from the getgo and call a spade a spade.\n\n- If the point of the above process is to determine whether or not the signal is stationary, it seems likely that it will always succeed a priori.\n\n- I still don\'t know if I understand the approach to figuring out the stationarity of the "real" market. Stationary is a property of models, not real things - even if you have something that looks like Gaussian noise, I still don\'t see how it makes sense to declare it stationary. I mean sure, you could just look at the probability distribution of the whole thing and apply that to any finite interval of the signal, but then you have *assumed* stationarity, not discovered it - you could also do that for any signal at all, even one with plenty of low frequencies!': 1, 'OK, so here\'s the technical details of the indicator. There are several mathematically equivalent ways to explain this, so I\'ll try them all and hope something sticks.\n\nThe first thing is to understand why normal BB\'s give such weird results. Despite my simplification of the subject matter above, BB\'s don\'t really calculate "volatility"; they do an N-point moving average and a moving standard deviation and then add s standard deviations to the average to compute the bands. I used simple moving averages above, but you could also work it out with EMA\'s as well if you wanted to.\n\nWhen the band dropped to $260, the 70-point simple moving average was about $500 and the 70-point moving standard deviation was something like $380. So, the algorithm takes $500 and subtracts 2*$380=$760 to get $-260. Oops.\n\nFor most "normal" assets, volatility doesn\'t ever get this extreme, so this situation doesn\'t arise - in fact, you can see in the pictures above that in periods of normal volatility, the normal BB\'s and the corrected ones more or less converge. So for Bitcoin, where this happens all the time, something else needs to be worked out.\n\nHere are the two ways of thinking of the corrected version, both of which are identical:\n\n- First, do everything on the log chart. Then do all of the usual BB calculations, and then take exp(price) to un-log it. So rather than doing mean(price) and std(price), calculate exp(mean(log(price))) and exp(mean(std(price))) instead.\n\n- When you normally do a moving average, you typically take the arithmetic mean (i.e. (a+b+c)/3, for instance). Rather than doing this, take the [geometric mean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean), which is (abc)^(1/3). Likewise, take the [geometric standard deviation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_standard_deviation) rather than the normal one. Then, rather than adding mean+s\\*std at each point, do mean\\*(std)^s instead, meaning you multiply the mean by a scaling factor rather than adding anything to it.\n\nThe two are equivalent. If you do things on the log chart as described, you will automagically end up calculating the geometric mean and geometric standard deviation on the linear chart anyway. Also, rather than using a Gaussian normal distribution, you will find you\'ve ended up with a [log-normal distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution) (thanks to /u/myselfbtc for finding this page; I hadn\'t thought of it like that).\n\nThe first way is easier to conceptualize everything, because if you don\'t, and if you ever work with price on a continuous timescale, calculus gets all weird; the normal linear integral operator is replaced by the non-Newtonian multiplicative [product integral](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_integral), which is multiplicative, and who the hell has time for that?\n\nEither way, the big picture is the same: it makes no sense to calculate the standard deviation in absolute dollar terms and add and subtract it to the mean. This way, you always calculate the recent volatility as a percentage of the current mean, and you multiply or divide things by this percentage to get the bands. You can never divide by anything large enough to bring the price down to 0, and so the lower band will asymptotically approach it rather than crossing the line. (That\'s a bit simplified, but it gets the idea across.)\n\nWhat should we call these? "Multiplicative" Bollinger bands? "Exponential" bollinger bands? "Lognormal" bollinger bands? "Geometric" Bollinger bands?': 5, "I'm not sure I understand. What do you mean by de-meaning the timeseries - throwing the SMA out and using the unaveraged ticker instead? How are you suggesting calculating the volatility bands? What do you mean by an envelope, and what do you mean by stationary?": 1, '* I also like the DSP approach, no disagreement there.\n* The point of this process isn\'t to determine stationarity.  As you pointed out with the DSP example, unit root tests are the appropriate tool for that job.  Though for most traders who use Bollinger Bands, a simple diff is a much more approachable technique.\n* My argument is that Bollinger Bands are really just way to observe local parameter evolutions of a Brownian Motion process.  The thought experiment of looking at stationarity is meant to demonstrate why imparting any predictive capabilities to Bollinger Bands might be a bad idea.  I would personally never trade BTC, or any other market on Bollinger Bands (or anything predicated upon Brownian Motion including Black Scholes).  That being said, I would definitely be interested in hearing any rationale for Bollinger Band usage based on sound first principles. \n\nMy perspective comes from developing HFT micro structure strategies in the US Futures and Options markets, which is an area that is devoid of many Technical Indicators.  I personally believe that a successful strategy must be built upon the entire set of market dynamics: prints, book incrementals, matching algorithms, news events, etc.\n\nEdit: Also, my original reply was really just meant to note that the negative values aren\'t a problem in the de-meaned series.  I never understood the visualization benefit of taking something that is a mean reverting indicator by design, and moving that indicator along with the price.  \n\nSomething else to think about is that while the lognormal approach makes sense from a "this thing willl never be worth less than zero" perspective (unless we are talking about interest rates or something), it discounts the fact that many markets exhibit greater volatility on crashes than on the way up.  This is pretty easy to fix but worth considering especially in BTC.': 1, "OK, I think I understand now. So after demeaning, you're left with basically the raw volatility signal, and this signal is stationary iff for all finite-length sequences of consecutive samples, the joint cumulative distributions are equal, which is the assumption made with something like Black-Scholes.\n\nSo in that context, Bollinger bands basically model the demeaned signal as consisting of Gaussian white noise at all times. In contrast, I'm suggesting we use lognormal-distributed white noise instead. So in the context of a stationary stochastic process, I assume that this would mean we'd want all of the joint cumulative distributions to be the thing you'd get if you start with N lognormally distributed independent random variables and go from there.\n\nFinally, you're saying that if the above situation doesn't hold, and particularly if the process isn't stationary and hence the distribution of the demeaned signal is a function of time, then Bollinger bands don't constitute an accurate financial model for this market (though they might still might be useful as a first-order approximation).\n\nHave I understood your meaning correctly?\n\nEDIT: after writing the above, it seems like BB's wouldn't assume a stationary process by definition, correct? The whole idea is that you're modeling the demeaned signal as Gaussian white noise *in which the standard deviation changes over time*, which is not stationary by definition. So how could that be a flaw?": 1, "Or you could just de-mean the time series and use the volatility bands as an envelope around the new series (which should distributed around zero).  If the de-meaned series isn't stationary then just take a first difference.  If the de-meaned series is somewhat stationary then you know that your MA is actually near the trend (which it won't be!).  ": 2, '"De-meaning" is the process of subtracting the mean from the signal (BTC prints in this case).  You might as well use the SMA or EMA.  Usually you are trying to isolate the terms of some underlying diffusion model, say brownian motion for example: dp = a*dt + v*dz.  So if the a*dt (drift or trend) part can be locally approximated by the SMA or EMA, then by subtracting that out you are left with the v*dz part (volatility strength * surprise).  The dz is the part we are checking for [stationarity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process) and if it is not, then your MA is a poor local approximation or your diffusion process is more complicated.  I would think that the latter case implies that B-Band analysis for the particular market is meaningless.  \n\nEdit: By "envelope" I just mean that you would plot your volatility proxy "v" (std, var, iv, etc..) at 0 +- v rather than MA +- v.': 2, 'The stationarity of the noise term as measured in B-Bands is very sensitive to the time window observed.  Long time windows will have more stationary noise but will also have fatter non gaussian tails.\n\nEdit: If the noise is not stationary then you can deal with that by modeling it as its own stochastic process ala GARCH.  In that case your noise is its own random walk.  Then what about the noise term of your noise term (ad infinitum).  Not to mention more exotic processes like jump diffusion or other non linear models.  This is why I was suggesting that it is best to difference the original time series repeatedly until you end up with something stationary.  If it takes 5 differences to obtain stationarity then you know you are that many steps removed from brownian motion (i.e. B-Bands with constant width).  It is no different than in calculus where taking the derivative of a function repeatedly will end at a constant once you have differenced out all the higher order stuff.': 1, 'Bitllinger': 1, "I think you smell what I'm cooking!

I'm not going to overly concern myself with future valuation, I'm going to trade (or not) and take my chances on etching out a profit while learning along the way.\n\nHopefully that's what we're all here for.\n\nConversation, debate, and learning for the win.": 33, 'I like your reasoning and your style, just not your conclusions. :)\n\nYou seem cool. And I wanted to say that, because I just disagree with the conclusions you draw when looking at the same facts.\n\nI agree, especially with the part about your key premise about "it\'s not in their interest" compared to the interest in "creating a trustworthy, world class exchange". However, I think still this demonstrates some naivete that all it takes is creating a trustworthy, world class exchange... There are a ton of risks with that pursuit, and as the markets change, so do the legal regulations, the social biases, and external pressures on exchange operators. They know their position better than anyone, as they wrangle to secure and support it daily - competition is fierce, and in any fierce competition for capital, advantages are rare commodities. \n\nWhile it\'s in the operator\'s best interest to become the most trustworthy, world class exchange, the road to that destination is wrought with challenges and getting an edge over the competition can be the difference between a dominant player and one who fades into irrelevance - look what happened at BTCChina so quickly. A few wrong steps, or a few aggressive moves that are legally questionable, and other exchanges overtook them virtually overnight.\n\nSo it\'s my position that becoming trustworthy, world class exchanges is probably the goal every operator sets out on... But it hasn\'t been the result every exchange has ended up at, and several have already failed due to taking the wrong steps at the wrong time. Why? In the real world there are challenges and competition to get there - this isn\'t a place that is hinged to ideals. And maybe through poor judgement or misplaced trust, mistakes, or bad actors, things don\'t work out despite the best intentions and **exploiting risky opportunities to gain advantage will happen unless it is technically impossible to do so.**\n\nLook at Intel vs AMD. Why does the Intel compiler use the slowest code paths possible when compiling for AMD architecture despite there being known better solutions? Competition. It isn\'t enough for Intel to be the dominant player in their industry, they will also defend it ruthlessly and pay the costs/fines in legal battles... Because it is an effective way to ensure their long term profitability and success.\n\nBut on a basic level, I agree with your belief these things don\'t happen often (or at all) with exchanges. Even more so, I agree that they don\'t happen for sinister or paranoid reasons. However there are grey areas and motivations that ensure toeing the line and going over it will happen, especially in areas where there isn\'t transparency or visibility.\n\nBTW: I disagree with your views about the orderbook making inserting fake trade data impossible. All trading executes at the best possible price - you can place a sell order for 1BTC at $1USD, but that 1 BTC will go to the current highest unfilled 1BTC of bids for BTC, and you\'ll get about $700 currently in exchange for that sell bid. So for example, it is simple for an exchange to add and remove sell/buy walls outside of the positions that are currently trading - they won\'t ever be touched by real people if they are removed before the action actually gets to them, but if there\'s a huge sell wall put up, often the market reacts in the opposite direction because they realize how long it wolud take to eat through that amount of support. Yes fake walls would show up in the orderbooks and through the API - it would look just like the activity of a whale or other traders. It would have to be done really poorly to stand out as obvious against the crowd.': 1, "you realize, though, it's the volume the counts, too, not just the number of traders.": 10, 'Gox, not stamp.': 3, 'Whoops, sorry I deleted the parent of this without realising it had a sub - that wasn\'t deliberate I promice! \nYou are replying to "how can you prove it\'s a whale" or similar.': 0, 'Wasn\'t a "superwhale".\nBitfinex is using the orderbook of bitstamp so it was probably them.\n\nEdit: Okay you said gox, I\'m sorry, in my mind i read stamp ^^': -1, '*Newbies: despite the bravado on this thread buy-and-hold is definitely your only option.*\nYea...lol lets forget again that bitcoin is supossed to be a currency.': 1, 'How is a public ledger different from an orderbook?

I've noticed some lenders try and undercut each other in terms of % interest which is silly and self sacrificing if you ask me.  As long as your interest rate isn't way outside of the norm there will eventually be a spike in demand for funds and your offer will be taken.  Identify what payout you need to justify the risks and investment, set that rate and turn auto-renew on, don't futz about manually making offers.\n\n2. Other people already explained this.\n\n3. With 10k on swap at .3% daily I'm making about $30 a day, which gets auto lent, and so on.  You can use a compound interest calculator to find out your specific return.  At 0.3% daily interest your looking at about tripling your money over a 12mo period.\n\n4. There is very real risk, don't let the prospect of easy money fool you.  There is a reason I have 10k on swap and not 200k.  You have to not only consider the myriad of ways the exchange could fail, but also what your earnings would be either day trading or buying and holding bitcoin or litecoin (or others) over a 12mo period.  Do you expect btc to double in price in the next 12 months?  Then you are making less money lending at 0.19% then you would by buying and holding.  At 0.19% daily interest, compounded daily you can expect to turn 10k into 19.9k.  Respectable, but again, what would 10k worth of btc or ltc be in 12 months?  Things to consider.\n\nMy advice?  Diversify your holdings, don't invest more than you can lose, and don't day trade until you have done so on paper without money and have arrived at the discipline and strategy to actually make money.  Lots of people say they are traders, but they are really just gamblers.  Don't be like them.\n\nAlso, people will typically accept offers with higher interest that are for longer longer periods of time.  Lots of lenders want their cake and to eat it to.  They want to lend for 2 days so as to try and not get left behind on a big market move.  Don't do that.  Commit funds to buying btc and funds into swap, and then maximize the returns you can get on those funds without worrying too much about what the other is going to do.  \n\nJust my two cents.": 3, 'If there was no risk,  everyone would have their savings there. Fact is,  there is huge risk. ': 4, "> Me and my girlfriend are thinking of dumping our savings into there since it just depreciating in the bank right now, what's the worst that can happen?\n\nJust two nights ago, Bitfinex had problems [due to a bug](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1x5jpx/psa_bitfinex_bugged_out/).  This made people nervous (including me), so they started withdrawing BTC, until it became impossible when the exchange's hot wallet(s) emptied.  \n\nThis issue was allegedly due to malicious traders attempting something nefarious, but the fact is that they were able to trigger bugs in the Bitfinex software which led to some very iffy behavior.\n\nSo, if the exchange has a more serious software meltdown, or some sort of regulatory limitations are imposed, like the recent Russian ones, you could lose some or all of your money, or at least lose access to it for a significant period of time.\n\nAnother risk is that Bitcoin has a serious crash, the positions can't be liquidated quickly enough, and you lose a chunk of your money.  Bitfinex apparently offers insurance but I've read that it has limited availability.\n\nNote that while you're just trading, you can withdraw your BTC almost instantly at any time.  If you're lending, you're locked in until the end of the term or until the loan is closed out.\n\nI've experimented a little - I made one 30-day loan which is still active.  Interest accrues every day as expected.  I would probably do it a lot more if I had more confidence in the stability of the exchange.  But it was a bit nerve-wracking watching the above events unfold the other night.  If I had significant money at stake I would have found it nightmarish.  It all worked out OK in the end, but as we see at MtGox right now, there are no guarantees.\n\nPersianSean's advice to spread money between exchanges could make sense - I know there's at least one or two other exchanges support lending, not sure of the details.\n": 5, ">It looks like the risk is next to nothing. Me and my girlfriend are thinkingof >dumping our savings into there since it just depreciating in the bank right >now, what's the worst that can happen?\n\nHonestly, dumping all of your savings anywhere sounds like a bad move. We've seen recently that instability can happen on some exchanges, and the only way you can have 100% peace of mind that you will have access to your coins is to have your own wallet. If you really want to put all your savings into BTC (which, I personally dont recommend- I have a roth 401k, as well as several coins- diversity is key in my opinion but people here will disagree), i'd consider spreading it between several reputable exchanges. I can't speak to the lending on bitfinex because i've never tried it (doesnt seem that profitable).": 3, "[796.com](https://796.com) offers a P2P lending market much like BFX's.

After all, someone could be sending the same money back and forth between their own addresses repeatedly. If you sent the same 50 btc back and forth 20 times, it would look like 1000 btc worth of activity, while in fact it represents almost nothing in terms of real transaction volume.\n\n> With "bitcoin days destroyed", the idea is instead to give more weight to coins which haven\'t been spent in a while. To do this, you multiply the amount of each transaction by the number of days since those coins were last spent. So, 1 bitcoin that hasn\'t been spent in 100 days (1 bitcoin * 100 days) counts as much as 100 bitcoins that were just spent yesterday (100 bitcoins * 1 day). Because you can think of these "bitcoin days" as building up over time until a transaction actually occurs, the actual measure is called "bitcoin days destroyed". This is believed to give a better indication of how much real economic activity is occurring on the bitcoin network.\n\nI didn\'t want to make this post too large, but I suggest going to the source and reading the rest:\n\n[Source](https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/845/what-are-bitcoin-days-destroyed)': 99, 'If this is the gox cold wallet being moved, it can be verified, as a long time ago, gox moved their entire coin stash a couple of times to prove they were still in control of them.

The Bitcoins in these transactions were last moved on 2011-02-28 or 2011-03-01. They are all moved to new addresses in a similar fashion, as can be nicely seen [for example here](https://blockchain.info/address/1FZovYMFRHXhKgHaSVJXpiLQnzkykwiKqk):\n\n* 0.001 BTC are sent to the new address.\n* The 0.001 (minus fees) are returned to the old address.\n* The full amount is sent to the new address.\n\nThe probable reason for this procedure is to verify that the new address works correcly (i.e. there is no bitflip or other error in the private key). Cryptographically, this is a questionable move as it is harder to do a brute-force attack on an address that never sent coins anywhere than on one that had transactions.\n\nThere are also a few transaction in which the test payment was accidentally (?) executed twice (e.g. [here](https://blockchain.info/address/1SYRwzEqDoc1mxjmSrpBWs5YPEf5NS6BG)), suggesting that the afternoon-run of the script that executed this was aborted and the whole procedure retried a few hours later. The time it took to perform all the transactions also suggests that there was some manual work involved (maybe related to security measures such as having to scan the private keys from paper wallets or preparing the transactions offline, erasing the keys from RAM and then sending them to the network). The pause between the steps in the above procedure could also be caused by waiting for a few confirmations - which would only make sense if this was a transaction between two different parties (i.e. a large OTC sale). However, I tend to think that these transactions happened within an organization. If that's the case, a potential motivation for such a move could be that the owner plans to fire one of his most trusted employees who had access to the keys - but wants to move the coins before doing so.

I don\'t know if that money just disappearing or having it all sell out overnight would be better for long term btc - the former means less market turbulance but then all the pundits would go around saying "look how unreliable bitcoin is because people had faith in a private unregulated company to hold millions of dollars in coins, and when said company lost them all, that means the entire currency is bad!" vs the price probably going under $400 if everyone on Gox could jump ship.': 2, "This kind of speculation is too premature given what the market is facing presently.

I'm watching the video right now and just got to that part, and he's talking about both supply and demand being relatively stable. At that point he was talking in the current time frame, where BTC is still being produced.": 3, "Transcript:\n\nGavin, who are you? what is bitcoin?\n\nGavin: I am a technology guy, I used to create 3d graphics software. I started working part-time when I got kids. In 2010 I stumbled upon bitcoin. Bitcoin got my interest. I decided to do the simplest possible project: create a website to give bitcoin away. I bought 10,000 btc and gave them away. At that time half a penny per btc. I got more involved in the project, started create code. Bitcoins then were worthless, now 800USD per piece. The reason why BTC are valuable and why people want them is because there are a limited number of BTC. This is different to other kinds of money as we don't know what the federal reserve might do next year. But with BTC there will only be 21 million BTC. That is what BTC is, and what is has become, but we don't know what it will be. People are talking about using BTC for all sorts of other different things, e.g. payment network, assigning [btc] to houses and cars.\n\nI am not a tech guy, if the software is designed in a way that is reliable dependable open software etc. What do you do when you go home and write code? Do you make it better? Do you find flaws, etc? When you are the chief scientist what do you do?\n\nGavin: When you are an engineer, when you develop software you are never finished. You are scaling up, more people use BTC, more transactions, etc. It has been a steep path and it has been hard to keep up. But software engineering needs to be done when there are so many more transactions.\n\nSo there are no fundamental changes?\n\nGavin: no.\n\nLet's start with the payment system. How does it work as a payment system?\n\nGavin: If you are now paying someone it typically takes 3-4 days. If I send an email it takes a few seconds. Why does it take 3-4 days to transfer money? Our payment systems was not designed for the internet. Bitcoin has been designed for the internet, it is more efficient and faster. When you pay someone, it makes sure it is the one you are paying without someone getting in between. It is global, there are no country boundaries. \n\nSo let me get this straight: Current payment system is slow, it was designed for the paper time not the internet time. But also to abide to regulations. What is the pushback when BTC avoids all regulations? We have seen this recently in the press. \n\nGavin: Regulators try to balance benefits and risks. They try to elimate risks. I think BTC has a lot of benefits. On a larger scale, how does the government adapt to the internet? I don't have the answers.\n\nSo we might have a Bitlicence? There might be some middle ground?\n\nGavin: Consumer protection, makes a lot of sense. Trying to control bitcoin? You can't force someone not to buy a particular shoe from a particular country just because you don't like that country. A government like North Korea will probably be very good in controlling BTC as they have been very good at controlling internet. A regulator might want to control that you don't buy anything from a particular country but it might not be possible.\n\nLet me move to virtual currency. Can you walk me through why do we need a new virtual currency? \n\nGavin: If BTC turns out a miserable failure due to technogical reasons or social reasons. But some governments might decide that they need a new payment system for this century. It really doesn't matter whether the currency is dollars or 'loonies'. If a new better payment system that is for this century is the only effect that BTC has that would be a success. Advantages of BTC: fixed supply, fixed rate of generating bitcoin. If there is a fixed supply and predictable demand, and then you get a stable price. Whether this will happen or when we don't know. I still say that Bitcoin is an experiment. With bitcoin there is no central person in charge, everyone can use it, everywhere in the world.\n\nLet me get back to fixed demand. The human population grows, so demand is not fixed. Bitcoin will go up in the long term, and what you can buy with it will go down and therefore you have deflation. It is one thing to say that it will take care of inflation. Don't governments central banks adjust the supply of money, interest rates to tackle inflation and deflation? Don't you need that human element?\n\nGavin: Deflation does not bother me. Apple seems to be doing ok even though the product you buy now you know that there is a better version of that product next year. If bitcoin is successful, I think it something that we might worry about in 20-30 years.\n\nQuestions from public:\n\n64% of Btc are not used. The fact that I know that I have got it that doesn't matter if most of them are not used.\n\nGavin: As the bitcoin price rises the usage of btc increases. People will want to hold on to BTC, like a safe store matras if you don't trust the banks etc. Bitcoins could function as an easier cash under the matras. But if the price goes high enough, you will use it. For example I paid for my hotel room via bitcoins, which actually saved money as I didn't have to pay credit card fees.\n\nBitcoin shows all signs being a disruptive system. Will the enthousiasm continue if it moves in the other direction?\n\nGavin: I think so. There is so much potential in bitcoins. \n\nWhat is the biggest threat to bitcoin?\n\nGavin: Something that I am not aware of, like astroids killing dinosaurs. Someone might come and develop something that is so much better than bitcoin. I don't think it is likely but it might happen. People might think it is nonpatriatic and therefore not use it and it might therefore only stay very small. A technical glitch might happen. I sometimes worry that we introduce a bug and then the system is down for a day. But banks systems are down every weekends, so maybe that is not such a big threat.\n\nIt is not very attractive to buy 0.0001 BTC\n\nGavin: People are developing ways to make bitcoin more secure and more easy to get. People are talking about millibitcoins, you don't have to buy 1 BTC you can buy 0.00001BTC.\n\nHave you seen any interesting things happening with btc in areas where there is not a lot of infrastructure?\n\nGavin: To give a stable payment system to everyone, even those who don't have it. I think it won't be long until everyone has a mobile phone. People are working hard to make it useful to use bitcoin where people don't have a lot of infrastructure. Something that hasn't been explored is the blockchain, people can be very transparent about how they use their money. People such as non-profit organizations.\n\nOn the side I run a charity and we accept cryptocurrency. You can trade it for cash, flights etc. How much time do you guys spend in trying to get vendors? I can see it being used as an american express point.\n\nGavin: there is no 'you guys' with bitcoin. It is everyone. You don't have to ask permission from anyone to do something with bitcoin as long as it upholds the law in your own country/state. \n\nHow about tax? Societies exist because of some tax revenue. Even if it is an anonymous transfer, do you voluntarily pay taxes?\n\nGavin: I get paid in bitcoins, but I do pay my taxes. I wish the taxing authorities were a bit more clear about what should be taxed. \n\nTerrorists, money laundering. How do you deter unsavoury people in bitcoin?\n\nGavin: that is a very good question. They think they already have the tools that they need to deter people. We have seen this with the closure of silk road. Once you get large enough in size, it will be hard to deter criminals. The more people get involved the bigger chance someone that uses it will be law enforcement. \n\nLast question: What have your interactions been with the government?\n\nGavin: My interactions with regulators have been very open and easy. We are really open. We show what the technology does, we have open source code, etc. The interactions have been positive, because we have been so open. I am not sure whether we can convince every regulator in the world that the benefits outweigh the risks but I think in the US we are on a positive track.\n\nI might not have gotten everything...\n\nEdit: spelling/formatting": 31, 'Summary: a guy is questioned and gives an excellent summary of what bitcoin it is to a lay-audience.

It has taken traditional banks hundreds of years to develop the kind of security they have now. Learning to protect cryptocurrency isn't going to happen overnight. I am expecting much bigger and more complex attacks to occur against various exchanges in the near future as the market cap increases. I would hope that most people are aware that investing in cryptocurrency will have large security risks during its initial growth.

USD may drop relative EUR, but if USD collapsed, EUR would probably follow. Whether the vice versa would hold true is up to debate.

At the very least, there would be, for most people, a flow away from bitcoin and into something they can use to purchase things.\n\nThe Turkish Lyra example isn\'t applicable to this situation, as it isn\'t a major world reserve currency. If Turkey (or the Lyra) collapsed, it wouldn\'t be great for foreign markets, but it likely wouldn\'t cause a global depression. If the dollar collapsed, the world\'s economy would drop pretty substantially (with a few exceptions, like Japan, which in 2008 was isolated due to the language barrier). You could buy bitcoin in that case, but there would be essentially no usable currency to purchase that would give you enhanced value, and meanwhile the value of your bitcoin would be dropping.\n\n\nBullish people would double down in that case and buy more bitcoin. The point I\'m getting at is a) bitcoin is not separate from fiat nor immune to changes in fiat value, and b) isn\'t usable without a conversion to fiat in most places. It\'s allowed to exist because there\'s no realistic chance it\'ll actually become a currency at this moment, and if it did (and stopped being a commodity) you\'d likely see it banned/regulated/etc. very quickly and in such a way that lead it to be tied even more inexorably to the dollar.\n\nHowever, if you live in a country with a non-major reserve currency base, bitcoin could make sense: you can protect yourself from your government collapsing.

I do worry about falling into an echo chamber.\n\nI do want to respond though, because my article DOES contain a fairly strongly stated conclusion. The conclusion is that the gap was closed primarily by a single (or small number) of large actors, and not by a general movement of the market. Specifically, I said: "...it is very clear what has happened here: manipulation. When volume looks like that, it is because it is caused by a limited number of entities trying and failing to hide their presence. I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest it was either 1 or 2 entities."\n\nThe argument I make for that conclusion seems to lead consistently through: odd price movement given recent history, sudden unexpected changes in price dispersion given the prevailing sentiment toward MtGox, volume indicative of a small number of actors. These are all the things I consider important in looking for manipulation in a market. I do think that the evidence I present builds a fairly convincing argument for that conclusion--if you disagree, I\'d appreciate if you\'d explain in some detail.\n\nI agree with you that it does not answer the question we all really want answered, which is whether MtGox is the actor. As you point out, I do not have evidence strong enough to support that claim, and so I avoided making that conclusion, although I am happy to suggest it, because I do consider it a very real possibility. If manipulation occurred, MtGox seems to me to be one of the most motivated parties.\n\nI consider that--my conclusion that manipulation likely occurred--a very important point, because it seems contraindicative of the general claim being made that the situation on MtGox is improving. If the gap closed as a result of manipulation by one or a few large actors, then the best piece of evidence that we have that MtGox is improving (the closing differential) is not actually evidence that MtGox is improving.\n\nMy apologies that the sentence at the top made me come off to you as a "delusional self-serving author [who] seems to truly believe he is important," but it was a sincere statement--I do think I\'m either very right or very wrong.

If I\'m wrong and it isn\'t, then the situation is different in the extreme. I do also think it\'s a very tumultuous situation--meaning noisy.

Gox prices soar to $900+ rapidly and the rest of the market follows into the $820 range before correcting back to about $750 once Gox no longer has any BTC to sell (typical "bank run" scenario).

For instance, "Sell X shares at Y dollars" (or buy), these are what you see in "level 2" or "l2", if you open "bitcoinwisdom.com", this is what you see on the right side of the chart.\n\nThere are "market orders," which are just "buy/sell X number of shares."

What these usually do is chop through the limit orders (see above) until X numbers of shares are bought baught/sold.\n\nThese two types of orders should be considered distinct. Because with every buy/sell, there is a sell/buy. So when people say X shares were "bought", they mean X market orders bought X limit orders. Vice versa with sell.

By "bitcoin withdrawal" we are referring to transactions from a MtGox bitcoin wallet to an external bitcoin address. Bitcoin transactions to any MtGox bitcoin address, and currency withdrawals (Yen, Euro, etc) are not affected by this issue.\n\nThe problem we have identified is not limited to MtGox, and affects all transactions where Bitcoins are being sent to a third party. We believe that the changes required for addressing this issue will be positive over the long term for the whole community. As a result we took the necessary action of suspending bitcoin withdrawals until this technical issue has been resolved.\n\n\n#Addressing Transaction Malleability\nMtGox has detected unusual activity on its Bitcoin wallets and performed investigations during the past weeks. This confirmed the presence of transactions which need to be examined more closely. \n\n\n#Non-technical Explanation: \nA bug in the bitcoin software makes it possible for someone to use the Bitcoin network to alter transaction details to make it seem like a sending of bitcoins to a bitcoin wallet did not occur when in fact it did occur. Since the transaction appears as if it has not proceeded correctly, the bitcoins may be resent. MtGox is working with the Bitcoin core development team and others to mitigate this issue.\n\n\n#Technical Explanation:\nBitcoin transactions are subject to a design issue that has been largely ignored, while known to at least a part of the Bitcoin core developers and mentioned on the BitcoinTalk forums. This defect, known as "transaction malleability" makes it possible for a third party to alter the hash of any freshly issued transaction without invalidating the signature, hence resulting in a similar transaction under a different hash. Of course only one of the two transactions can be validated. However, if the party who altered the transaction is fast enough, for example with a direct connection to different mining pools, or has even a small amount of mining power, it can easily cause the transaction hash alteration to be committed to the blockchain.\n\nThe bitcoin api "sendtoaddress" broadly used to send bitcoins to a given bitcoin address will return a transaction hash as a way to track the transaction\'s insertion in the blockchain.\nMost wallet and exchange services will keep a record of this said hash in order to be able to respond to users should they inquire about their transaction. It is likely that these services will assume the transaction was not sent if it doesn\'t appear in the blockchain with the original hash and have currently no means to recognize the alternative transactions as theirs in an efficient way.\n\nThis means that an individual could request bitcoins from an exchange or wallet service, alter the resulting transaction\'s hash before inclusion in the blockchain, then contact the issuing service while claiming the transaction did not proceed. If the alteration fails, the user can simply send the bitcoins back and try again until successful.\n\nWe believe this can be addressed by using a different hash for transaction tracking purposes. While the network will continue to use the current hash for the purpose of inclusion in each block\'s Merkle Tree, the new hash\'s purpose will be to track a given transaction and can be computed and indexed by hashing the exact signed string via SHA256 (in the same way transactions are currently hashed).\n\nThis new transaction hash will allow signing parties to keep track of any transaction they have signed and can easily be computed, even for past transactions.\n\nWe have discussed this solution with the Bitcoin core developers and will allow Bitcoin withdrawals again once it has been approved and standardized. \n\nIn the meantime, exchanges and wallet services - and any service sending coins directly to third parties - should be extremely careful with anyone claiming their transaction did not go through.\n\nNote that this will also affect any other crypto-currency using the same transaction scheme as Bitcoin.\n\n\n#Conclusion\nTo put things in perspective, it\'s important to remember that Bitcoin is a very new technology and still very much in its early stages. What MtGox and the Bitcoin community have experienced in the past year has been an incredible and exciting challenge, and there is still much to do to further improve. \n\nMtGox will resume bitcoin withdrawals to outside wallets once the issue outlined above has been properly addressed in a manner that will best serve our customers.\n\nMore information on the status of this issue will be released as soon as possible. \n\nWe thank you for taking the time to read this, and especially for your patience. \n\nBest Regards,\nMtGox Team\n': 3, 'sounds like all the did since shutting down was come up with this BS..\nPulling a runner and buying time.': 2, 'My landlord in Hollywood is an old Israeli man and by god, he was tap dancing in the apartment above me last night.': 1, 'Works for me without logging in: \njust go to the gox main page and click on it in the news feed.': 1, "What's more, [he predicted it before it happened](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1xg8xv/the_mtgox_debacle_explained/cfb2fxr).

Everyone else knew about it and designed their system to work around it, but you didn\'t, so don\'t blame us for your own stupidity.  We\'re actually working to fix the problem for everyone while you wouldn\'t even understand the issue if we hadn\'t pushed you in the right direction..."': 17, "In short, no.

In order to do big international transactions, you need a higher market cap because a high market cap generally means higher volume and more liquidity. The use of bitcoin for international transactions is going to come much earlier in time than an "all-bitcoin ecosystem" where major companies are selling things for bitcoin, paying suppliers in bitcoin, and paying employees in bitcoin. The former is already happening. The latter may never happen at all. \n\nSo if I have a large remittance company (call it Eastern Alliance) and I want to take 500 million USD and have it arrive in Eastern Alliance\'s Chinese bank account in RMB using bitcoin, then I\'m going to have to buy 500 million dollars worth of bitcoin on the US side and then sell that bitcoin in a short period of time on a Chinese exchange. \n\nAccording to http://coinmarketcap.com/ , bitcoin\'s market cap is ~10 billion and its 24H volume is ~13.2 million. My 500 million dollars in volume is going to rock the boat too much for this to be feasible (setting aside the the trust/legal/legacy banking/exchange issues). Without a high market cap, I can\'t even think about trying to do major transactions using bitcoin without causing chaos.  \n\nI read posters saying "The price is going up too fast! There are too many bubbles and crashes. We need stability to attract business!" But they don\'t actually ask the question "What will give bitcoin\'s price stability?" The answer to the question is that a much, much higher market cap is what will give bitcoin\'s price stability. And we can see that bitcoin\'s volatility has been decreasing as its market cap rises. Bitcoin becomes more stable and more useful as its market cap grows. And it\'s a higher market cap that will attract the developers and entrepreneurs to develop the bitcoin ecosystem, not the other way around. Bitcoin exploded in value at the end of last year and then all the sudden 120+ bitcoin ATMs were ordered and are being built for deployment in just about every major city in the world by the end of 2014. Do you think that would\'ve happened @ $20 per bitcoin and a market cap in the millions?

The effect that the price of a BTC has on making purchases.\n\n2. The effect that adoption rate has on raising the price of BTC.\n\nFor the first, I mostly agree that it doesn't matter in so far as the personal mechanics are concerned. You just use more of them, or fewer of them, to make your purchase. The problem is you can't have a lot of people making a lot of purchases if the total market cap for BTC is too low to enable that. That would be like giving 100 people $100 each and telling them to each buy a car. Combined they might have enough money to purchase one car (or several cars), but each of them has way too little.\n\nFor number 2, absolutely it has an effect and matters quite a lot. Adoption is one of the primary motivators behind price increases, especially sustainable price increases. We see bubbles pop when speculation outpaces utility, and one of the types of utility is being able to make purchases with BTC.": 5, "How can I not save your comment?

Had the cascade continued most lenders would have lost 90%+ of what they offered on swap.  It's easy to say that that is just their counterparty risk, and it is, but from the point of view of a margin trading platform this would destroy their product.  If that occurred lenders would either leave, or only offer at substantially higher interest, effectively making margin trades untenable.  I would also point out the difference in risk profiles between lenders and traders, but that is getting off topic.\n\nNow whether this meltdown of the liquidity market should be allowed to happen could easily devolve into a free market debate, but ultimately in this free market bitfinex decided that they didn't want that to happen to their product, so they halted trading.  Again, not saying it's right or wrong, but I will say that had they not taken action their wouldn't be hardly any liquidity available on bitfinex today.\n\nSo, in the event of a sudden cascade of shorts forcing the price sky high, in this case their isn't a risk of the liquidity pool being destroyed, and so I doubt that bitfinex would necessarily step in, though they might.  This might seem unfair in a strictly lender vs trader framework, but really the issue is long vs short traders.  The lenders are necessary for either one to work, and so I think most would agree that there needs to be a system that at least manages some of the risk of complete wipeout of the liquidity market.  It's just that the short traders get the short end of the stick (ha) because they are the ones having their profits squeezed to protect the lenders.\n\nNow, I've carefully avoided actually stating an opinion here because honestly I haven't made up my mind on what the best course of action is.  In between the various vitrolic posts on the bitcointalk thread there were some legitimately good suggestions to bitfinex about how to handle cascades to better protect lenders in the case of a downward cascade, and protect borrowers from unfair and arbitrary trade halts and rollbacks.  Solutions varied from circuit breaker, to time dilation on trades, allowing traders time to close positions in a queue that is timed to avoid massive cascades.\n\nSo I guess what I'm saying is that I'm sympathetic to the people who shorted and saw their profits vanish, because I've experienced losses because of liquidity issues on bitfinex, but I do think that bitfinex did step in and protect the overall market and product that they offer, and have tried to reimburse some of the short traders.  They are in a position where they will face these kinds of growing pains and tough decisions and I think the main thing will be to have clearly articulated policies.": 11, "So... their exchange engine borked out, you managed to squeeze in a highly profitable trade during that time and proceeded to gamble with that money right away again?!

This created a cascade where every single margin position was going to be force closed and the price of bitcoin on their exchange would have dropped to near $0 for a loss of nearly $16 million in loaned funds.\n\nSo to prevent this they halted their trading engine.  It didn't crash, or at least that isn't what they have said on bitcointalk, but that they halted it to prevent that cascade.  Now, right or wrong is subjective and you can feel free to claw your way through the umpteen million posts on bitcoin talk beating that dead horse if you want.\n\nThe only real fault I can have with them is that the protocol wasn't established before hand.  It looks like they are taking steps in that direction though, to have some sort of circuit breaker mechanism to prevent a cascade of forced closure of margin positions.  Even the regular stock markets will halt trading and roll back trades that shouldn't have happened.  The difficulty with bitcoin is that it is not a centralized entity so one exchange halting doesn't stop the rest of the market from either continuing to crash or recover.\n\nThat's the nature of the beast though, this is an unregulated, decentralized market.  You need to make informed decisions about your investments into this market and whether or not you are willing to accept the risks that come with it, which include events like we had this week.  I lost money last November/December when bitfinex lost liquidity on bitstamp and didn't halt trading, so it's a damned if you do damned if you don't scenario.\n\nAlso, your implication that the only reason to use bitfinex is for shorting isn't true.  Lots of people go long, or just trade without margin.  Given the difficulty of the other exchanges this week, I don't think it is fair to single bitfinex out, especially given that they have made an effort to reimburse people.  Their is only so much counter party risk that they can assume (to the tune of millions of dollars) in how much usd and xbt they keep at bitstamp, so I wouldn't be surprised if this were to happen again, so plan accordingly.": 12, 'So it\'s just about terminology, right? Stops get taken all the time at currency and stock market.

You are primarily addressing concern #1 where we disagree but I do appreciate your well reasoned response. We don't agree on #1 because cascading margin calls should be closed. If you are long at a certain % and someone ahead of you is forced to dump into you, that is the risk you have when you go long.\n\nAsk yourself this, if Bitcoins jumped to $1200 on Bitfinex because of the opposite situation (a bunch of shorts getting margin called), would people insist those that sold at $1200 get their profits clawed back to $800 levels? This only addresses concern #1 but I am interested in your response.": 1, "Thank you again for another great post, exactly the kind of discussion I wanted to facilitate with this thread. One thing I will note is that they only compensated short traders who lost money AND cashed out immediately at $630 -- a very small portion of people.\n\nIf you had a short at $720 and tried to cash out anywhere below $630 you got no reimbursement. If you had a short at $660 and got rebounded past the $660 mark because the engine came on at $630 and shot past $660 very quickly you got no reimbursement and had to accept a loss. There are very few shorters who made any gains despite that being an ideal night for shorting. There was absolutely no reimbursement for any profit lost from $530-630 or losses accrued beyond $630 price in the reversal. Essentially shorters weren't allowed to close their positions for profit and if you did not cash out the INSTANT the engine came online you accrued even further losses.": 6, "Ouch that is unfortunate then.

Then a few days later, the price of LTC dropped to $1.70 or so, and I thought it might go down lower due to the failure of uptrend.

A traditional double spend would be when I pay person A with 5 BTC from my wallet, and then somehow I manage to also pay person B with the same 5 BTC, and both transactions get included on the blockchain despite not enough BTC.  So effectively, a double would create new BTC on the chain without mining them.\n\nWith Gox, they aren\'t creating traditional double spends, they are just idiots who may be paying some people twice because they couldn\'t tell that transactions with adjusted tx IDs were getting rebroadcast to the network and accepted on the blockchain. They never spent the same BTC twice with a true double spend, but they may have to come out of their own pocket to true up their BTC balance if they paid some people more than once on a withdrawal.': 2, 'Enjoying your uncited blanket statements?\n\nGo back to /r/bitcoin.': 3, "This is incorrect.\n\nThey are exploiting transaction malleability, however the problem isn't the same as Gox.

Nevertheless, I would strongly argue that in terms of making money, litecoin does have its merits. As the current price point is far below bitcoin, the percentage fluctuations in its price is quite more variable and as a result, if one can purchase at a decent price and hold, they will typically see much higher percentage gains than with bitcoin.\n\nFor example, during the bitcoin crash to $380, litecoin hit a point of approximately $9-10 depending on the exchange. Bitcoin eventually bounced back to a high of $995 give or take which is something like a 130% increase.\n\nOn the other hand, Litecoin during that jumped from $9-10 to approximately $30 which is a 300% increase.

I\'m sure many early adopters invested in Bitcoin for the same reason: They saw an opportunity to make money in the long term. Heck, I might take a loss but not a significant one.\n\nThink about this: If you were to invest $100 in a coin such as LTC October 2013 when it was worth $1.11 you would have gotten approx 90 coins. Just 1 month later in November those 90 coins were worth ~$48. You just brought in $4000 by taking a guess that LTC would one day grow. \n\n\nThat being said: This is just my opinion. I\'m not a professional and you don\'t have to agree with me. I just think that if no one took a chance on Bitcoin when is was factions of a penny then it wouldn\'t be where we see it today.

In order to have less volatile prices and less server load, Coinbase may have switched from using bitstamp for exchanges to using campbx or perhaps even doing their own internal trades.\n\nTL;DR: \n\nPreviously, coinbase was reliably tracking with bitstamp's pricing. From what I could gather, the spread between the buy and sell prices had a direct relationship with the spread between the high and low on bitstamp over a 1m timespan.\n\nDuring a volatile 1m timespan on bitstamp, the spread on coinbase would be high. I saw the buy price at one point more than $15 higher than the sell price. At the same time, the bitstamp chart on bitcoinwisdom indicated there was a spread of near $15 between the high and low over a 1m period. But when a 1m timespan on bitstamp had a small difference between the high and low, the spread on coinbase was small. I've seen as low as a $0.30 spread.\n\nThe coinbase price followed bitstamp's so reliably, that I wouldn't be surprised if they were pulling prices from them, or possibly even using the bitstamp exchange.\n\nAt some point during the last 24 - 48 hours, this all changed. The coinbase price no longer tracks bitstamp at all. It is closer to bxcamp's pricing, as @nomadismydj suggests. However, although it is similar to bxcamp's price, it doesn't seem to track it as closely at it used to track bitstamp. \n\nFor instance, as of 9:53AM PST, there is very little volume on bxcamp, which has a price of $733.00. On coinbase, the buy price is $731.46 and sell price is $729.38. Note that the campbx price is greater than both the buy and sell price at coinbase. Previously, the coinbase buy price was always higher than the bitstamp price and the sell price was always lower. \n\nWhen I was buying BTC via Coinbase during the price drop (it wasn't a crash) the other day, often while confirming the purchase, it would say the price had changed. Then I had to confirm it again. At one point, I had to confirm the change 3 times before I could buy. And I wasn't waiting any time between confirmations. \n\nThis price volatility could lead to much higher load on Coinbase's servers. It may be in coinbase's best interest to not use a highly volatile exchange. This could be accomplished by changing to using an exchange with much less volume such as campbx. Or perhaps coinbase now does enough volume on their own that they have started doing their own internal trades?\n\nIt may also be in Coinbase's interest to have less volatile pricing. Their goal is to provide a way for the average Joe to convert between fiat and bitcoin. The more stable their pricing, the easier it is for their merchants as well. They are not trying to be a service for day traders.\n\nBottom line is that something has certainly changed at Coinbase. It will be interesting to see what kind of impact it makes.\n\nI have no idea if I'm right, but I'd love to hear your thoughts.\n\n": 4, 'I remember when their was a $200+ price difference between CampBX and Coinbase. $900 to $1100 was a great arbitrage opportunity.

So yes, keeping them consistent with each other will be to your benefit so you get different perspectives on the data about that same 10/16 pair.\n\nAs for stop-limits, BitStamp lacks that functionality, unfortunately. While you can do limit orders for buying below market and selling above market price (so you can effectively set a "take-profit" limit), they don\'t have a feature to protect against extreme loss. The best thing to do is know what your stop-limit is, watch the markets at regular intervals, and obey the limit when it gets crossed.\n\nGood on QT\'s developers for adding that in soon - it\'s an essential part of trading.': 2, "Sorry about the delay on the reply! \n\nThe parameters here are described as Stochastic Length, RSI Length, K, and D. The first two are your intervals, just like when you set intervals for your EMA and MACD. To better understand the K and D values' use, [this explanation of the StochRSI's calculation](http://www.barchart.com/education/std_studies.php?what=std_stochrsi) seems to be pretty clear. %K and %D are poorly-named (or at the very least, non-descriptive) components to the Stochastics Oscillator, and are used in this case for smoothing. For example, if you start turning up the %K and %D values on Bitcoinwisdom, you see a lot of each line's noise start disappearing in favour of a smoother path.\n\nFor the StochRSI to be matched to your EMA (10,16), you could go with StochRSI(16,16,3,3). This will keep the %K and %D where they are by default to introduce some smoothing, and will have your RSI and Stochastic lengths matched for that 16-interval window. The reason I recommend 16,16 instead of 10,16 or 16,10 is because, as described in the link above, the Stochastic RSI is *an indicator of an indicator*. Where in RSI you will want the 10,16 arrangement to compare 10-day calculated information to 16-day calculated information, the StochRSI should be giving you information relevant to one timeframe, just a different perspective on it than you'd get with only the RSI. In fact, simpler sites like [Bitcoincharts.com](http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg2zig15-minztgSza1gEMAzm1g10za2gEMAzm2g16zxzi1gStochRSIzvzl) only show one parameter for the StochRSI (theirs defaults to 14), since that value is used for both the RSI Length and Stochastic Length calculations.\n\nNow, you could go with 10,10 for the StochRSI, but take a look at your chart - that's one hell of a volatile indicator! The fewer intervals involved, the harder it will be to have it produce a usable signal.\n\nI hope that explained it and helps with your analysis!

I think if we did finally get a quality, legal exchange in the US the price would rise. The current state with the exchanges isn't helping price, but is built in. The exchanges have always sucked, really, though they are getting better. Used to be that Gox was really the only name in town, remember. Competition is a good thing, as is not having all of our eggs in one basket.\n\nTo address individual points: We don't know that Gox is about to implode. Seems that Gox has always been a little wonky, and this $100+ spread vs other exchanges is certainly not a new thing. People also seem to be slowly leaving Gox, or at least setting up accounts elsewhere which can quickly be funded if need be, so unless Gox pulls a runner then I think an implosion will have limited repercussions. A small pull back probably, until everyone has switched to other exchanges and we see if those exchanges can handle the new volume.\n\nOn Huobi vs BTCC, this is actually a great case for the ingenuity of the BTC community, and of people who just simply want to make money. Huobi went from having very little volume to taking on all of BTCC's in the space of what, a week? And they handled it quite well. Another point in favor of a Gox death not being a big deal. \n\nAs for them working outside of the bounds of the law, no one actually knows what the Chinese gov't intended the law to be, and China (th gov't) seems to like it that way. Bobby Lee has reinterpreted the PBOC's statements to mean he can use a business bank account for transfers, and Huobi and OKCoin made that determination a month ago. I'm not Chinese, I'm not from China, and I don't pretend to understand their culture, but the exchange operators over there seem to think they're operating in the clear. They also seem intent on keeping BTC. I think people can be a little too quick to discredit that.\n\nHuobi and questionable volume: We've all always questioned the supposed volumes coming out of China. It was no different when BTCC was leading. They have exchanges with no fees, so of course the volume is going to be higher. That could certainly explain a large chunk of it. But in the end, does it matter? If we learned tomorrow, definitively, that Huobi is faking volume, do you honestly think it would hurt the price? It might actually help the price if people think that fewer BTCs are under the purview of the fickle Chinese gov't.\n\nBTC-e certainly has transparency issues, but they handle their volumes beautifully. Bitstamp is very reputable and also seems to handle its volume well. There are a few other, smaller exchanges out there as well (Kraken, for one) which are well-respected in the community. We have a pretty large assortment of exchanges now vs a year ago, and I have a feeling a year from now there will be even more. New ones keep popping up in Hong Kong, e.g. Exchanges are money makers, and capital will flow into their creation.

Because the history isn't just some tiny factor on the side, you get history from the combonation of many many factors and how people react to those factors. While history never repeats itself one for one, it almost always has repeatable patterns within it.

I don't think averaging is a valid overall strategy (the reason being you can only trade less and less volume the farther you get from your starting point). It's something you can flip to in uncertain times with low volatility, further decreasing volatility. So yes, that strategy might be what locks the price in place right now, but it's not the cause for the low volatility.\n\nThere is something else. Prediction decreases volatility and reaction increases it (see panic). Lets do some primitive prediction. If the last upswing's high was 100, many will assume it will not go past 100 in the next upswing because nothing has changed (news and such). So you want to sell high but you think others will do that too so you decide to sell at 95 or 90 or something. This means the new high will be lower, decreasing volatility. This happens with every swing, and that's how triangles work (revealing a possible underlying macroscopic trend, that will then be affected by predictions too).\n\nSo long story short, volatility is low because nothing happened that caused the price to swing, not because of bot strategy fights. By the way, I don't think there is a real difference between bots and people. Bots are tools and strive to do what an experienced human trader would do.

It\'s a completely fabricated argument based off of growth in the Dogecoin subreddit and their active users.  /r/bitcoin is freaking out over it.  Currently /r/bitcoin has about 102K subscribers, of which about 1600 are active at this very moment.  Compare that against Dogecoin\'s sub where they have a little over 53K subscribers and about 2K active in the sub right this very moment.  What people are freaking out about is how quickly Doge picked up steam.  However, they\'re not actually looking deeply at the market stats, they are just observing how the doge hivemind differs from the bitcoin hivemind.  The Doge community is very friendly and welcoming, and doesn\'t take itself seriously.  They aren\'t out to profit, they are out to help and participate in something bigger than themselves.  That\'s a pretty stark contrast to /r/bitcoin.  So they fear that Doge\'s rapid growth in users could continue, and that before we realize it Doge could actually become a more viable alternative due to sheer user adoption rates.  Again, this is all bullshit.\n\nDoge is just an entryway into cryptocurrencies.  It\'s the training wheels to bitcoin.  It\'s not going to surpass bitcoin anytime in the near future.

See [Multipool](https://www.multipool.us/).\n\nAssuming that the profit-switching mining pools convert their doge -> btc, because it has more utility, then it will cause an increase in btc/usd value and a decrease in doge/usd. Some of the miners will convert doge -> btc -> usd, because it's a better store of value, which won't have an impact on the markets.\n\nAs a currency btc enjoys more adoption. For the most part the firms that accept doge are a subset of the firms that accept btc. This is the argument for the network effect. Having said that doge is enjoying a rapid rise in adoption.\n\nAs a currency doge is to btc as craft beers are to multinational beer manufacturing operations(MBMO). Their existence is possible because it takes advantage of the existing network that the larger operation created. In beer's case this is the distributors.\n\nHowever the MBMO's have market hegemony over craft's distribution. They could make their distributors exclusively sell MGMO. Bitcoin cannot do this. It is conceivable that doge will usurp btc.\n\nWhich brings me to as a protocol. As a protocol doge is scrypt based, making it more resilant to advances in computing power. It is possible that parallel computing architectures will be engineered to support larger RAM. The high ram ASIC markets have already been incentivized by litecoin. Fibonacci(April), Alpha Technology(Q2/Q3), Flower Technology(August). We'll see when the hash-rates are posted how much of an impact this makes.\n\nAll the perceived advantages of ltc are enjoyed by doge, except one. Due to the hilariously large doge/block the blockchain and volume of doge is growing massively. If someone was so inclined they could send a bunch of tiny transactions and bloat the blockchain.
