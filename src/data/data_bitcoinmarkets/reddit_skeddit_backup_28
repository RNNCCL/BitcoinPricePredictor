This is what happens when the price "stabilizes" and the difficulty keeps right on growing... I would classify it as, biting the hand that feeds. You see... In order for me(and the rest of the miners) to continue securing the network and processing trades and withdraws *quickly* the value of the coin needs to keep pace with the difficulty increases(that doesn\'t mean that horrible B word >.> either).

I mean... I might cash a few out every once in awhile but having to leave the table would be devastating! :O\n\nSo... Someone(came over to the darkside for a visit) posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMining/comments/2ccu02/anyone_mining_hard_in_countries_with_apparently/) little gem and suggested that miners are making "a killing" with cheap electicity(and while that might be true for the mining "whales" AKA your worst nightmare) and that\'s obviously NOT what\'s happening and something we need to work on <3together<3. I think more destabilizing might be in our near future(just a guess with what\'s coming down the pipeline) and when those scary "difficulty explody" months come, we must ban together! \n\nSo....

I have informed many of my friends about the benefits of bitcoin, and have urged them to use it.  But very few have followed through after a cursory glance.  Why?\n\nTo me, it\'s as simple as the fact that bitcoin is a relative pain in the ass to use.  Not for me, nor anyone else in this sub of course.  We have all taken the requisite time to learn how to utilize wallets and make purchases.  Many of us came from backgrounds where, though we may not be cryptography experts, we were knowledgeable in creating strong passwords and confident in our ability to safeguard our keys.  But for the majority of people out there, there is not enough incentive to develop the skills to utilize the technology in its current state.  Denying it won\'t help the cause for bitcoin adoption.\n\nThe plain fact of the matter, IMO, is that we will not see mainstream bitcoin adoption until the whole process is as easy and secure as pushing a button to pay.  Once that simplified user interface exists, we could see mass adoption very quickly.  But doggedly defending bitcoin\'s value on this sub does nothing to further our progress to that goal.

If you set the price variance to 0 or something very low like .001% you\'re practically placing a lot of smaller market orders.\n\nLets say I place an iceberg order with 0 price variance. The first order will go onto the order book and be filled immediately(0 price variance means at market price) and lets say it pushes the price up $1. Now, since the first order is filled the second order is placed, again at market price, so it is filled immidiately, and once again pushes up the price $1. This will be repeated since every new order is pretty much a market order. The orders pretty much come self-fulfilling since each new order pushes the price up higher and triggers an order at that higher price that will continue to push the price up triggering an order at that higher price that etc etc...\n\nHowever, if I use a price variance of .5%, the first order will go into the order book a little under the current price.

I lost almost 200k. While I do not share the setiment of the OP, I am of course down on my outs right now. I feel this is my fault entirely, and has nothing to do with btc-e, but the fault lies more in the interpretation of how the Margin Call/Stop loss works. I\'ve gone back and pulled conversations between me and support to reference.\n\nHere is what support told me when I quesionted them thoroughly on the specifics of precisely when the stop loss occurs:\n\n*"The Company closes the Customer\'s open positions without the consent of the Customer or any prior notice if the Equity is less than 15%of the (Initial) Necessary Margin.\nIf the Customer has several Open Positions, Company has right to close all open positions or the first position with the highest Floating Loss or closing open positions by FIFO (First In, First Out) method.\nIf a Stop Out execution has resulted in a negative Balance of the Customer\'s Trading Account, the Customer remains fully liable for this loss.\n\nFor example, you placed a Buy order of 1 BTC at price 500 USD. Your leverage is 1:3. It means that the Necessary Margin for this order is 500/3=166,66 USD.\nLosing trades are closed automatically when your Equity becomes less than 15% of the Necessary Margin (i.e. at Margin Level of less than 15%).\nIn this case Stop Out level is 166*0.15=25 USD.\nStop Out is executed similar like Stop Loss Order.\n\nPlease note that Margin call happens before Stop out (Margin call - less than 30% of the Margin level, Stop out - less than 15% of the Margin level)."*\n\nNow, HERE is where they confused me. I would like the communities input on this because I thought I interpreted it clearly. After receiving that message, I responded with questions asking for further details and providing specific examples, they responded with:\n\n*"Please be advised, it is the responsibility of the Customer to maintain the minimum Margin Level requirements to support all open positions without notice from BTC-e.\nBTC-e is not obliged to make any warnings to the Customer prior to liquidating the position for insufficient margin.\n\nIn case of Margin call no email will be sent to you. Margin call will not close your position, this will occur in case of stop out."*\n\n^^ The last sentence is what had finally clarified it for me, and which is why I have lost all my money today. Had I known that the MC occured precisely at 30% I would have put more funds in to prevent it, but I was certian that *the margin call would not close my position* ...because they stated it clearly. Instead *it will close in case of a stop out*...in which case that meant:\n\n*"Equity becomes less than 15% of the Necessary Margin (i.e. at Margin Level of less than 15%)."*\n\nSo I thought I still had plenty of breathing room. \n\nWhile this definitely sucks for everyone involved, hey, thats all part of the \'betting game\'. You make a badly timed bet, you loose. I just wish I did not misinterpret the scenario, because the information provided by support seems very very conflicting to me now.\n\nIf anyone could respond with clarifications or whether you see the conflictions, please let me know. I just want to know at this time and point that im not crazy.\n\nThanks all, and hopefully a lot of you guys made a ton of money shorting.': 14, 'QQ much?': 2, 'deserves more upvotes.': 1, 'Better rates than 0.00 % ?

My first exposure to the internet was walking into 6th grade in September 1994, where my teacher had a PC connected to the internet. He showed us on the first day of school how to connect to the web and every single one of us was instantly amazed. If I recall he logged into a chat room "quickly" and asked people where they were from, responses came back from other states, but one person wrote "Germany." The teacher turned around and said "see that kids, you can talk with anyone from around the world instantly now."\n\nThis sounds overdramatized, but he was an overly dramatic person, I think he had practiced this little event before school began, either way it blew us all away and each of us got to use the internet in class all year. Few if any of us had it at home yet, but we all now wanted it and bugged our parents incessantly. \n\nAnd that is my point, the internet created a buzz that I remember permeated all groups in a way that Bitcoin has not yet done. Sure, more people know about Bitcoin now than in years past, but the internet had become a major buzzword in 1994, it was in the news constantly, kids and adults talked about it all the time. Even my late great uncle, 68-years-old then, was telling us about how "amazing" this internet thing was when he ran into us at a 50s diner one night. Using it was incredible, and those who hadn\'t been online yet wanted to try it. \n\nComparatively, if you polled my present co-workers (including IT guys), family and friends right now about Bitcoin, you\'d get a mix of "I thought it went out of business?" to "I\'m not really sure what it is." I am known as the Bitcoin person, so I get random thoughts thrown at me about BTC, an unbelievable amount of people think Bitcoin was Mt. Gox and all the coins were stolen/are worthless now. I still get asked "did you lose a lot of money?" or "I hope you sold everything" by people who are slightly more knowledgeable. I then have to explain Mt. Gox was one exchange, and that I bought my coins a long, long time ago and lost nothing.\n\nI\'m sure few could explain how the internet functioned in 1994, but they knew it was this "thing" that got you "online" where you could visit web sites, buy things, see cool video clips (even if they took 2 hours to load) etc. Today, Bitcoin is largely confusing to people or they think it died. \n\nGranted, anything could happen, but another thing to be leary of is that the internet was successful and so it\'s arc followed a trajectory of increasing popularity. Bitcoin could follow it, sure, but in this lingering middle phase, it could also die entirely or be replaced by a competitor. Like some crypto-currency owned by Visa, sold as a safety upgrade, that you buy through them and spend "without fear of getting your card stolen any longer." ': 42, 'Awesome story.

And I don\'t think that is as good a comparison because as amazing as http is, it\'s really just a gui skin over a bunch of underlying technologies - the "killer app" that made the Internet relevant to everyone. \n\nThe Internet was developed in the early 1970s and by the early 1980s was rolling out to most University campuses. By 1985 some students were starting to use email a little and you could dial up to internet based services.  By 1990 it had become apparent that the Internet had commercial utility and companies started rolling out systems like email. \n\nSo for decades it was a very promising technology with seemingly obvious commercial and social implications - for those few patient people who could envision the use cases.\n\nNow, we all use email. But amazingly, email was not the Internet\'s killer app. Which really is amazing if you think about it. People and corporations did not mass-adopt email. Faxes reigned supreme. Think I\'m wrong? Watch Back to the Future 2 (1989) in which there is a scene that accurately predicts videoconferencing but somehow still includes a fax machine. Email was almost twenty years old when this movie came out. That\'s how slowly it penetrated social consciousness. \n\nSo for twenty years it goes like this, with usenet and email and irc. Nerds only. If you were a non-nerd using email in 1992 it\'s because a nerd got you into it. And you were *still an early adopter even though the tech was 20 years old*. \n\nThat\'s where we are now. The killer app for Bitcoin (which could be remittances or anything else) doesn\'t yet exist. Infrastructure for the killer app isn\'t ready yet and is still being built out. And nobody here really knows what the killer app will be or what will happen to the Bitcoin world when it arrives. \n\n"Mosaic" for Bitcoin hasn\'t yet been conceived. \n\nI can tell you this: for a lot of geeks in 1995 the WWW ruined the internet that they knew and loved.

It wasn\'t easy to get, and for a while you had to go looking for it. No one was advertising it on TV. There was news reports and things (just like bitcoin) on the technology, but no *company* was going out and advertising. In addition, if you think back to the internet, you had to give up your phone line to use it. So not only did you have to pay for a land line (which was the primary form of communication... think about giving up your cell phone today), but you also had to pay on top of that for the internet AND you couldn\'t use the phone at the same time. You essentially had to give up your phone just to use slow, undeveloped internet. Oh, and of course you\'d have to have a computer to run all of this (but most people had them at the time, just like people have smartphones capable of containing bitcoin now).\n\nIt\'s not just looking and seeing, it\'s having a friend tell you of a better way to do things. Then you want that advantage so you buy in. People don\'t buy shit just because someone else has it, they buy it because they see a way to make their life easier.

I think a more relevant comparision is with "IP convergence". Before IP (or the Internet) there have been several proprietary networks, like the public telephone system that have later been converged to IP.

Nevertheless, the transformation was large-scale and massive over the past 20 years. \n\nOne of the few networks that resisted convergence were the payment networks. And this is where Bitcoin steps in. Sooner or later payment processing will converge to IP using the (or a future version of the) Bitcoin protocol. VISA, Mastercard, all will be using it as backbone network just to save money and increase their capabilities. It happend before and it will happen again.\n\nRemember when you were using modems to dial-up to your ISP to surf the Internet? Back at the time this was the only way to get Internet access from home: by using the legacy technology and put IP on top. Of course it was slow and sucked, but it was the only widely-viable option. Compare this to Bitcoin debit cards: same story. Bitcoin is being tunneled on top of the legacy technology just to make it widely usable. It took a few years until broadband internet access via cable TV or fiber became available to get the real deal of the Internet, and IP phones could be used on-top of it. Similarly, it will take some time until everybody will natively accept bitcoin. Maybe a couple of years later the same POS will accept VISA USD but route it via some USD-colored coin on top of bitcoin or similar, as a legacy option. These can be exchanged for real USD at VISA\'s or Mastercard\'s exchange and transferred to/from your bank account. The user won\'t notice what happens behind the scene.

I think the ratio is something like 15%.  So I can buy something like 6 times as much by borrowing.  That means if the price doubles, I get 6 times the return.\n\nHowever, if I hadn't borrowed, I can ride out a downturn all the way to zero.  Since I borrowed, if it starts heading down, I need to have collateral in my account.  As soon as I don't have enough collateral, they liquidate my position (sell the borrowed coins), and pay back the loan, which can wipe me out entirely very quickly - to zero.  So the price might only move down 100 points, and my balance is then zero, because they had to take ALL my collateral to pay off the loan.": 5, "So this happened to a lot of people all at the same time?

If the price was to fall more, you could no longer pay back the loan with your bought bitcoins and your collateral.  To ensure that lenders get their money back, the exchange will sell your bitcoins (both the borrowed ones and the ones you keep as collateral) and pay back the lender.  To prevent slippage the exchange can sell the coins at a slightly higher price, they show this price or an estimate of it to you if you open a leveraged position.  \n\nOf course, if a lot of people have taken out long positions (borrowed USD to buy BTC) and the price drops so low that the exchange is forced to sell their coins to pay back the loan, you can end up with a cascading liquidation, where the sale of some persons coins drops the price enough to trigger the sale of the next persons coins, and so on.

PayPal has yet to reach any agreements, the people said. The timing of when Braintree would accept bitcoin is dependent in part on such a deal.\n\nBraintree provides software for payments processing to many online and mobile companies like Uber and Airbnb.\n\nEBay and PayPal wouldn't initially accept bitcoin, the people familiar with the matter said, but that could change over time. EBay Chief Executive John Donahoe told The Wall Street Journal last year that he was considering ways to use bitcoin.\n\nA deal would provide a boost to bitcoin, a virtual currency that backers believe can someday displace cash or credit cards in many transactions.\n\nOverstock.com Inc. is among the biggest retailers that accept bitcoin, through a deal with Coinbase struck earlier this year. Overstock said this week that it expects sales of goods using bitcoin to be $6 million to $8 million this year and to average $1 million a month by year-end.\n\nBraintree was processing more than $12 billion in payments annually when it was acquired by eBay in December for $800 million in cash.\n\nBitcoin is created by computers solving complex math problems. Once created, bitcoins can be traded on currency exchanges or used as money to purchase goods and services from merchants that accept it.\n\nBecause ownership and many transactions are recorded, backers believe the virtual currency is less subject to fraud. Some bitcoin users have adopted the currency because it isn't backed by any country and can be traded with less scrutiny.\n\nBut bitcoin has been plagued by volatility and the collapse of a major exchange. The currency was being sold on some exchanges for more than $1,000 at one point last year and is trading at about half that value today. The value of all bitcoin is $6.7 billion, according to Coindesk's price index.\n\nThe virtual currency is also attracting regulatory scrutiny.

The value of an open short position is derived from the following formula:\n\n(Price Asset Sold - Current Asset Price) * (Quantity of Asset Sold)\n\nStep 3. You now hold that asset--the open short position--in your margin trading portfolio on Bitfinex. In order to stop holding it, you must successfully buy a number of coins in Margin Trading equal to the quantity you sold. You can buy them three ways: MARKET, LIMIT, STOP LOSS, or TRAILING STOP.\n\nA stop loss order works by selecting a price. If the ticker price (last trade) of the asset reaches that price, a market order for the quantity of your stop loss is created. As such, if you\'re working with a large number of coins, it\'s advisable to divide up your stop losses, staggering them slightly, to prevent placing large market orders (due to slippage).\n\nA trailing stop on Bitfinex sets a static number, like $10, and then places a market order for the quantity you selected if the ticker price of the asset ever reaches $10 higher (or lower, in the case of a trailing stop sell) than the lowest ticker price the asset has seen since you place the trailing stop.\n\nI write reviews of Bitcoin exchanges, and you may find some of the information on the (slightly outdated) Bitfinex one useful.

It has less value if it\'s bouncing all over the place.

If it were a fluke or an anomaly, then it would not be stable at that price. An extended period within a certain price range convinces people that this price is solid - a minimum.  Bitcoin is a high-risk investment, but if I can convince myself that at least there\'s a base at $585, with a high potential, then it feels like less of a risk.\n\nc)  Bitcoin price is generally on an upward exponential climb, but over certain periods, "irrational exuberance" drives the price to be much higher than the "natural" exponential climb.

I personally predict that hash rate will fall amidst yet another squeeze, as the last time we saw price at $60 less than average cost, we saw hash rate plummet. Let\'s see if it holds true again.
