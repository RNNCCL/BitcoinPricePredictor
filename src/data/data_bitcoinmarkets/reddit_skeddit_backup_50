Also, when I talk about VJET I do realize that it is common for newly public companies to be volatile.\n\nLet\'s take a relatively new industry in the stock market: 3D printing. The market leader in the industry is an eponymous company called "3D Systems" (DDD). A "silver" company in the 3D printing sector is Voxeljet (VJET) and Stratasys (SSYS) (among a few others). The three stocks, along with the whole sector, have price changes nearly identical to each other, although VJET recently had its IPO and more than doubled its price in about a month (we\'ll see where it goes from here). This leads me to believe that they do have roughly similar price movements, but they also can change as a result of their benefits, technically and or fundamentally.\nSecondly, SSYS is an older and was a more had more stability in price when compared to DDD. The market realized around Jan. 2012 that DDD had, and was developing, certain things that made them near, and eventually surpass, the value of SSYS. In other words, the company was undervalued and had shoes that it could fill. Now the two companies have a roughly similar and large market cap that seems to be stable and growing.\nMy point is that there can be two or even more cryptocurrencies that can coexist; it doesn\'t have to be one or the other. Right now, Litecoin has certain technical and fundamental advantages to Bitcoin as blocks generate quicker, there isn\'t nearly as much Chinese investment ATM, leaving it room to grow, hasn\'t been picked up by the major exchanges yet, leaving it room to grow, etc.\nEven if Litecoin were to be the same as Bitcoin technically, and the two were identical, Litecoin should be priced right now at around $250. As we all know it is around $30 now, leaving it LOTS of room to grow.\nI guess this was my long-winded, roundabout way to get my opinion across that Litecoin has potential.

It could skyrocket up more in which case not buying in is bad.  But i would wait at least till this weekend.  \n\nMy reasoning is if you buy back in at 720 and it goes down 200 dollars you'll lose a lot of money.  Presumably that 590 you sold at is made of some reasonable profit.  Its crashed a few hundred quite a few times recently, it would be logical to think it will again.\n\nThe risk is a lot of new money is coming on board and they are willing to buy at any price because of the potential future gains (so don't give a shit about paying 720 a coin or more).\n\nHowever as we know some people are making a killing trading, doubling their coins.  The market must be being manipulated to some extent and to make money some people have to lose, therefore we get large movements, as someone else stated for people to make money someone has to be losing it.  So it moves, especially if the new money buying high gets scared.   \n\nAn extreme argument would be Bitcoins are going to be eventually worth millions or become worthless.  Or both at some point. I love bitcoins and i think they will become worth a lot more and be really useful.  However i don't think the system is good enough to last forever and could be improved.  Those improvements might lead to something else.  Also regulation risks - something really bad could happen.\n\nMy plan is to just wait it out and wait for it to go down.  The problem is it definitely will bounce and judging that point is the skill.  If it goes below 600 i will have some difficult decisions.\n\nIf it keeps rising and doesn't touch sub 600 again, say hits 1000, i would expect it to then crash to at least 700, i might consider buying back then.\n\nApologies that turned into an epic bitcoin ramble.

': 1, "My sympathies noggin, as this is almost my story (and I'm sure many many others) but for the fact I've just edged ahead this last week.  My opening trades were spectacular gambles of ill conceit, fueled by the excitement of having finally gotten money onto an exchange, which earlier this year from China was a feat in itself.  I missed a low buy in of $55, though I did manage a low of $67 amongst various others.  Hindsight is a funny thing, I've had so many positions that would have made 6 figures to date, but there's no way of knowing how they would have alternately played out had I had them run into such substantial profit.  Would I have held for so long?  Where would I have sold?  What would I have done with these wins from a trading perspective?  I started my speculative 'career' by margin trading $10k+ of my own money, and for a while there it seemed like I was being plugged into the matrix for the sole purpose of sending the market in the opposite direction of where I was headed.  Interestingly for me the volatility I've seen stemming for the SR shutdown to date has made me rethink my approach considerably.  When you find yourself sitting and watching the market almost every waking hour (as many here do) you should know something is up.  You don't need to be in this every minute of everyday, I'd argue that will likely sting you in the long run.  Instead learn to take a position that makes sense fundamentally (though for bitcoin this is no guarantee), instead of executing while your heart is beating like a drum out of your chest while you can't see straight for lack of sleep.  I had a 24 hour run once (where I did actually make good) that ended when I literally passed out.  I woke up 3 hours later with my position still open, not knowing what the hell to do with myself I was in such a daze.\n\nI almost gave up on trading a few weeks back, but realised I was being too emotional about my experience and not thinking so concisely about what I'd been doing.  Anyone in here who's a little fresh at this game I'd advise forgetting what you coulda, woulda, shoulda done before today but to learn from it, and set in place a methodology that doesn't suffer the noise of such thinking.  Being able to ride all the waves would be some insane luck given all the obstacles and unknowns, so instead look for ways to make consistent though perhaps albeit smaller profits.

How did they do it? Since QQ was centrally managed, all the Chinese government had to do was tell Tencent to limit QQ's use or face a total shutdown of their business. So Tencent reeled it in.\nSuch a move is not so easy with the decentralized cryptography of Bitcoin, and Chinese officials know that.\nWithin months of the chop on QQ, the Bitcoin algorithm was released anonymously online. Bitcoin is difficult to trace.

They have been doing the opposite for decades, and killed a virtual currency as recently as 2007.\n\nYou shouldn\'t ask so much why would they "suddenly support" Bitcoin.  You should ask why **are they supporting** Bitcoin.  Because the quite clearly are.\n\nThe answer is that they export more goods and services than they import.  If trade shifts to a fair currency, a level playing field, exporting countries win.  Because the currency flows into those countries and out of countries like the USA.  \n\nNow the USA just prints and prints money to keep the game going.  That allows us to buy goods and services from China, then devalue the money we paid by printing more.  Which we continue to use to buy more goods and services.  \n\nChina is very upset about this.

Usually when the bitcoin price goes up, the litecoin price follows, the same for when it goes down. But this usually happens with some delay. Wouldn't it be possible to exploit this delay and trade bitcoin -> litecoin and then back again to make a profit? And the same goes for between exchanges. The prices between exchanges are usually connected, but not that much (because of this delay). Isn't is possible to similarly exploit this and always come out with a profit, without any risk of losing money? (since you'd only trade when certain conditions are met...

If I buy a bitcoin at 10 and sell it to you at 20 and then you sell it to someone else at 30, and so on...everyone makes money, as long as the price continues to rise over time.\n\nThis is *only* true if prices keep going up, as you mentioned. In your example, the creator makes a coin, someone buys at $10, then sells at $20, who then sells at $30, etc. The profit flow is $10 for the 1st guy, $10 2nd guy, etc. However, the last guy who buys in before the prices crash is left holding the bag. So say he buys in at $100, and prices crash shortly after to $0. Guess what, zero-sum. Of course, while crashing to $0 is highly unlikely, **if the possibility even *remotely exists*, it is zero-sum**. Prices will never reach zero (barring an exploit), so it may seem like everyone is winning at the moment, but the system itself is still zero-sum.

The second model supports your assertion about slope and has the benefit of larger sample size although the adjusted r^2 isn't very striking.\n\nFor those without a stats background, a rough and tumble and sorely oversimplified explanation (my apologies in advance to my fellow scientists): in addition to calculating statistics that show the relationship between two variables (say, variability over time), we can calculate additional numbers to help us interpret how likely the relationship we've found is due to random noise or chance. That is, we can calculate additional numbers to give us a guideline to assess whether the relationship we are observing is likely due to chance or if we are likely to see that relationship if we continued to take samples (that is, the relationship we've found is likely to be a significant one, not a spurious one). The p-value statistic is one such number we calculate. A general rule for interpreting this statistic in the social sciences is to consider a regression statistic significant if p < .05, and some accept p < .10. The cut-off we choose depends on how willing we are to risk accepting results that are due to chance. The small the p value we use, the more confident we can be that the trend we are seeing is not due to random noise/chance.\n\nGiven that, it would only be statistically prudent to consider the second regression (using 41 months/41 data points) as providing a reliable estimate - that is, we can have some confidence that the negative slope found there is more likely than not due to noise. That said, other statistics suggest that the specific slope given (-2.57) is a very rough estimate at best and has a large margin of error (although all values within that margin are negative).": 8, 'Go Banana!': 1, 'So you drive locomotives by day and trade bitcoins by night?': 2, 'Yeah, I never took a statistics class.

So you could have an internal protocol that worked domestically with member banks, and for international transfers they could use something like bitcoin.\n\nHonestly though, a lot of these sorts of issues are things that ripple was designed to handle.  The problem with inter-bank transfers is that they need to send exact amounts of fiat around, which is difficult if you use a system like bitcoin.  Ripple sort of solves that by allowing them to perform transfers in USD over the ripple network.  If each member bank became its own USD gateway (or whatever currency) then member banks could all trust each other up to certain amounts and have quick, exact transfers.  The transaction fee is in XRP which are cheap, so no real cost there outside of maintaining the gateway.  You could also have banks running public gateways for their customers, and BTC gateways so you could seamlessly transfer bitcoin and USD in and out of the same bank account.\n\nRipple has a lot of hurdles though, one of which is PR.

What I am unfortunately NOT able to do: I'm not competent to evaluate if the current Bitcon price of $950 is still ridiculous cheap assuming the described scenario I believe in - or if all those hopes are already over-reflected in the price. I don't know if there even are any economical tools at the moment to answer this question (like P/E ratio with stocks etc.) and I normally don't invest in things I don't completely understand - but I'm afraid I will become weak and bet some gambling money in this case.

My personal believe is that mined bitcoins are treated as income (minus expenses) base on the value at the time of production. Then, if the miner intends to subsequently hold the bitcoins long term for speculative purposes, the subsequent change would be a capital gain or loss.

If so, I disagree with that. The the wording "nonfunctional currency is disposed of by an individual in any transaction" is in the context of a clause that is just saying that if its an individual and its a personal transaction (less than $200), then "any transaction" in that situation cannot apply 988 treatment.

So, the regulation says non-functional currency (any currency other than dollars in the U.S.) gains and losses are income (specifically interest income), not capital gains. The forward contract clause (a)(1)(B) is not defining 988 transactions but is defining a subset that allows capital gains treatment. \n\nSection 988(c)(1)(C) has an awful title "Special Rules" and so I glossed over it as the previous section B seemed to be where the 988 definition ended.

You\'ve allowed for the possibility that it turns around at a bunch of different placses, or that it doesn\'t... \n\nYou can cobble together a weak form of falsifiability from a vague prediction so long as it differentiates between outcomes at least a little - if the thing you said is least likely keeps happening, then we can take that as you having been proved wrong, but it would earn more respect to *take the risk* of being abjectly entirely wrong - to declare a certain outcome to be impossible under your theory, so that if that one were to happen, we could all say once and for all "That theory is broken, let\'s not use it again".

A good example is the stock market crash of the 1920s. So many people were making money hand over fist in the stock market that it was getting to be very popular. Everyone was doing it. The markets grew so quickly, it was unprecedented. Eventually there were no more people to buy in, the price stopped climbing and so a few people sold. This acts as an incentive for others to realize their gains and also exit the market. \n\nMost bubbles occur around new technologies, such as the 1990s Dot-com bubble. A lot of people claimed that there was no bubble and that many of these companies could continue to grow due to the advent of the Internet and others. Unfortunately the true value was much lower than what the market has been lead to believe and so it eventually corrected way way down.\n\nWhether a bubble is rational or irrational, it doesn\'t really matter. Money comes and comes, but eventually the majority are bought in. There\'s not much driving the price up now, at least not at the wild rate it was previously.\n\nWhat seems to be occurring with bitcoin is a positive feedback loop. Basically many investors who hear about bitcoin are content to invest in it with no other reason than, "It\'s going up." This means that they will buy in at whatever price, thus driving the price up, thus attracting new ignorant investors.\n\nUsually a stock will self adjust its price: if the price is high there is an incentive for people to sell and drive the price down. Conversely if the price is too low, people will buy and bring the price back up. However, in a bubble there exists a state of disequilibrium. All the new investors will buy in, driving the price up and up, until inevitably the market crashes back down to it\'s actual value.\n\n**TL;DR: There can only be so much new money. Eventually there\'s only people with bitcoins, so the only option is to sell. At that point to find a buyer you\'d have to offer a heavy discount, thus the price will drop rapidly.**': 29, "Well I've made a lot of profit considering I bought in at an average of $50.

There's no reason to downplay that by putting it on log scale and saying it's not as radical as the linear scale shows.\n\nBut that is exactly what is happening with bitcoin. The price is growing exponentially because the population willing to invest in it is growing exponentially. Each person that has invested in bitcoin tells X of their friends about bitcoin over some period of time T. A certain percentage of those X people decide to buy bitcoins, call it Y. Those Y people tell X people about bitcoin, etc. This is just like each cell of bacteria dividing into two cells, which divide into four, etc.\n\nJust like bacteria growth slows down once the colony starts to run out of available resources to reproduce, bitcoin growth will slow down when the world starts to run out of new people that are first hearing/learning about it.\n\n": 4, 'Again for argument\'s sake: Perhaps the 2011 + 2012 \'little bubbles\' were "something that happens to very young markets", and now were knocking on the door of the BigTime... the whole exercise (~30yrs) is now a bubble [a phwor-massive-huge bubble]. \n\nSomething I liked a few days back was "when it\'s a bubble - nobody knows it\'s a bubble".

Suppose you have a population of bacteria and you believe that the population will behave like:\n\nP(t) = A e^(r t)\n\nwhere P(t) is the population at time t, A is the initial population at t=0, and r is the rate of growth. If we take the natural logarithm of both sides of this equation, we get:\n\nln(P) = ln(A) + r t\n\nNow this is just a linear function of t. So if we plot ln(P) on the y-axis instead of P (i.e. a logarithmic scale), then our x intercept is the natural logarithm of the initial population and the slope of the line is equal to the rate of growth, r. \n\nIt is easy to see why this is helpful to do with bitcoin. Plot the price history of mtgox on a linear scale and the huge crash in 2011 will look completely insignificant because it was a small movement in absolute price difference (30 -> 2 is only a $28 swing and we have those all the time, right?). However, on a log scale you will see the rise and crash because absolute price differences are not what is important.

The steepness of the slope represents nothing other than "how much" it takes to go in one direction.\n\nIf the first guy you see on the left is trying to buy $1,000,000USD worth of bitcoins it means the sell wall is steep and it will take a $1,000,000USD sell off to lower the market price to the next guy below him.\n\nIf the first guy you see on the right is selling only 0.1XBT and the next guy after him is selling for $10USD higher price it means you only need to purchase that 0.1XBT to raise the market price.\n\nHowever, there are other factors that go into your purchase/sell decisions.

If the Bitcoin market crashes, I wouldn't be the only one upset, so at least I wouldn't be alone.\nActually, to be honest, if that happened I'd probably buy a little more just in case.": 1, 'More people wanna sell than people that want to buy. Or there is a standoff between buyers (low) and sellers (high) one group has to give in and act.\r\rSo if there are too many sellers, they now have to compete for these "few buyers".

I know that should be something very obvious, I\'m just very confused as to how people sell for lower than the ask and still manage to turn a profit. I\'m all sorts of mixed up.': 1, "I keep hearing about how day-trading is a hopeless effort and how you will lose money in the long run.  And with trading fees, I can understand that.  But what I don't understand is, even if you only make pennies by selling at a higher price, it seems simple enough to just buy at a price you think is low and sell when it goes higher than what you bought.  Even if the price continues to rise afterwards, it still seems simple enough to just buy, wait for the value to appreciate more, and sell again.  You might not be making much, and it'd probably be better to just hold, but you'd still be making money.  So why is it that people keep talking about how complicated it is to day trade, saying don't even bother, you will lose money, etc.?  Is there something I'm missing?\n\nAnd also, why *wouldn't* you sell when you see a huge spike in the price like we did last week?  Is it because you're waiting for a bigger one in the future?  If that's the case, wouldn't you at least sell a percentage so you can take advantage of the bubble while keeping some in store for the future? Then you can use the cash you got from the sell to buy more if the price drops, but if it doesn't, you still have BTC.": 6, 'Great explanation. I\'d also add here that like most things in trading, walls can sometimes be counterintuitive. Like you said high or steep walls might indicate resistance and you\'d expect the market to move in the opposite direction away from them. But sometimes when there\'s a constant price rise or drop you get what I\'d call momentum in a certain direction. And if you look at the depth you see the walls a lot more steeper in the direction of the move.\n\nThis is opposite of what your instinct will tell you, but if you think of it as a bush or forest fire - if the fire front is moving in one direction, consuming everything in it\'s path, it leaves a trail of burnt destruction in it\'s wake. In the market it\'s eaten through all the walls on it\'s way in the current direction, leaving the "dominant" seemingly weak and thin. Just wait - it\'ll fill in again like a forest growing back even stronger after the fire.': 1, "I use that chart as well but is there anywhere I can set the moving averages?

They are cancelled at the end of the trading day if they haven't been filled. \n\nHowever, you can specify that you want the order left up forever by marking it good 'til cancelled (GTC). \n\nFrom what I've seen, most bitcoin exchanges use GTC orders by default. Perhaps because there is no real trading day to be defined. It's truly a 24/7 market.": 1, 'logarithmic vs linear?\n': 1, '> "24/7 market"\n\nIndeed.': 1, "I'm not saying hold on forever. The point I'm trying to make is that traders are often quick to cash out winners and tend to hang on to losers. This creates a lot of small gains and then a few large losses that more than offset those gains. \n\nThis is in regards to daytrading for a profit. Your scenario of cashing out your initial investment is a fine strategy.": 1, 'I had a market order ride through about $50 the other day. Not doing that again in a hurry. ': 2, ">  A market order is designed to be filled immediately, regardless of price.\n\nYes, that's what i meant.  The intention of a market order is to be filled once it is initiated at the current market price.  Yet they can be filled at a much different price depending on the que rank.  I should have been more specific.": 2, "If the price rises significantly and then pulls back, it lures in a bunch of bears thinking that the top is in and it is time to sell. If the price then continues up, that dip becomes known as a bear trap. It lured the bears in and then rose, causing the bears to lose money. \n\nReverse all of that and it's a bull trap (people buying what they think is the bottom, but it is not actually the bottom).": 3, 'That\'s not really true. A market order is designed to be filled immediately, regardless of price. So the "market price" may be 800, but by the time your whole order is filled you could get prices significantly different than the price where you entered the order.': 1, 'So a market order is different than a bid/ask? \n\nI came across this as an example:\n\nThe "Bid: 13.20 x200" is an indication that there are potential buyers bidding $13.20 for up to 200 shares. Their bids are the highest currently bid; and there are others in line behind with lower bid prices. So the "bid" you\'re seeing is actually the best bid price at that moment. **If you entered a "market" order to sell more than 200 shares, part of your order would likely be filled at a lower price.**\n\nThe "Ask: 13.27 x1,000" is an indication that there are potential sellers asking $13.27 for up to 1000 shares. Their ask prices are the lowest currently asked; and there are others in line behind with higher ask prices. So the "ask" you\'re seeing is the best asking price at that moment. **If you entered a "market" order to buy more than 1000 shares, part of your order would likely be filled at a higher price.**\n\nA transaction takes place when either a potential buyer is willing to pay the asking price, or a potential seller is willing to accept the bid price, or else they meet in the middle if both buyers and sellers change their orders.\n\nThe bold: How do you avoid buying at a higher price and selling at a lower price?  How does this work when people are panic selling and the price is crashing and you want to get out?  \n\nI\'m really showing my ignorance with this stuff but just trying to understand so I don\'t screw myself over once I get verified on the exchanges. ': 1, "That hasn't stopped the market price from following an envelope of 10^(current_year - 2011) USD/BTC plus or minus one year. \n\nThere is a lot of interest in BTC as a long term store of value. I think most BTC holders and most market activity is centered around this fact. Without the network destroying itself, I don't think this use case of bitcoin is going away. It appears to be enough to prop the price up on its own (albeit with the occasional bubble). \n\nThis is why I feel safe buying and holding at almost any price. I'd rather know I _will_ hold x btc, rather than _hoping_ the price goes down so I can buy 2x btc later.": 1, "Since this is the 'ask dumb questions thread', I feel okay in saying that I still don't get why this is a bad thing? So let's say I bought 10 bitcoins when they were like $100 each. My outlay was $1000. I sold them at $200 so my balance is $2000. I've made a grand (which in this simple example was also my break even point relative to my initial stake). The value of BTC drops to $150, so I buy a $1000 worth, so I have like 6.67 BTC and I wait until the value goes high and sell.. as long as I never spend my profit after I've broken even on my initial stake, then surely I'm doing okay? After all if Bitcoin slumps to an extreme and my coins are worth shit-all in USD, then I just hang on to them, it's not really any skin off my nose since I've kept back the amount plus profit that I originally committed. \n\nSorry for the noob type questions. I'm purely coming at this from a casual investor kind of perspective. Ie. not someone who's envisaging making a lot of cash from BTC, but just to skim off a little profit each time. I get that there are transaction costs and this way of doing things has diminishing returns in the long run due to this.\n\nAlso, when you say:\n\n>You should hold on to winners and cut losers short\n\nI understand cutting losers short, but holding on to winners seems pointless if you never sell?": 1, "I did a rudimentary ticker against Gox a while back.
