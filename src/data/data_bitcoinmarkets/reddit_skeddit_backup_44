They might offer this because it saves them banking fees, credit card fees, and other labor costs associated with handling money, or for other reasons like business partnerships, investor stakes in bitcoin itself, etc..  Leave it to the market to get creative on how to use bitcoin to its advantage.\n\nThis is the infrastructure that is needed to make things really easy.': 1, 'The "instant-buy" feature on coinbase allows you to purchase 1BTC without having to wait 30 days for your account to be verified.

People just sell some BTC for what they need over their stay': 1, "See, I don't think its such a big step forward.  You talk about how not much has changed in the last 5 years, but to me that sounds absurd.  5 years ago Bitcoins were trading between a handful of people for pennies (the 5 year anniversary of the genesis block was fairly recent, like in the last week or two).  Since that time we've seen countless exchanges emerge, merchant services, gift card systems, lots of different wallet services, a plethora of different Bitcoin-centric companies, and so much more.  That's just 5 years time, and for most of that time (4 years, 80%) the price of Bitcoin was less than $10-$15 each.  Most of this development has really happened in the past 12-18 months.\n\nNow we have retailers beginning to look at Bitcoin and accept it.  Now we have the public's eye and mind (even if they don't understand the basics).  Now we have the finance world's eye, and various private investment vehicles springing up to invest in Bitcoins or bitcoin companies.  \n\nYes, in the near term, bitcoin still isn't a currency yet.  What I mean when I say that is that the average person can't do normal daily transactions with Bitcoins yet, they still need fiat.  But look at the growth and expansion of the infrastructure that we've seen in the past year alone, and to me it's clear that improvements are arriving all the time.  That's one of the beautiful parts of the protocol, how it can always be updated to accommodate new market needs and trends.\n\nI don't disagree that right not the infrastructure is still poor, but what I'm saying is that Rome wasn't built in a day. The improvements are coming all the time though. First step is to get businesses involved and accepting BTC.  There's no point in getting the general public to understand bitcoin without getting business on board first.": 6, '> But what benefit does that give to new investors? None.\n\nSure it does. As early investors spend and retailers convert bitcoins received to fiat, that pushes down the price of bitcoins so that they are cheaper for new investors than they otherwise would be.': 2, "I would argue that all of those things are coming (or already here in some way/shape/form), except for chargebacks.  I'm not sure how they would write that into the protocol.\n\nEasy fiat conversion - this is already getting easier.  Yes, getting money out of exchanges like MtGox and Bitstamp are not simple, but the average US consumer can just use Coinbase, which is very easy.  In fact I'd go as far as saying that Coinbase is the simplest way for anyone in the US to buy bitcoins.  But in the future, exchanges will be capitalized to a level that allows them to pursue money transmitter licenses, and bank transfers will become far easier to/from exchanges.\n\nDebit Cards & ATMs - Your phone will be your debit card, and the internet will be your ATM.  You will be able to pay with things directly from your phone via wallet apps.  I envision redesigned POS systems where the cashier will ring you up, and if you choose to pay in bitcoins then a QR code will pop up on the payment pad, and you'll scan it with your phone, and that will automatically set up the payment details in your phone's wallet app, and all you'll have to do is hit send.  In seconds, both sides will show the incoming/outgoing transaction, and you'll be on your way.  To facilitate quick transactions, they may need to adjust the protocol (for both more transactions processed per minute, but also the speed of confirmation).  Personally, I think this could be achieved by adjusting the block reward downwards, and then reducing the corresponding difficulty to solve a hash so that a block would be solved every minute, thereby allowing for much faster confirmations.\n\nFraud potection/charge backs - Bitcoin will remain the wild wild west for a little while when it comes to fraud protection.  Hopefully developers will come up with a safe and secure wallet which can be widely used, but in the end it will come down to people being safe with their wallets.\n\nWallets in the cloud - doesn't this already exist?

Overstock and Zygna are just the beginning of retailers stepping into Bitcoin.  In the short term, retail adoption will not drive the price sky high, it will likely hold the price downwards because of selling pressure it puts on the market as the retailers convert their BTC to Fiat at the time of transaction.  But in the long term, increased amounts of retailers accepting BTC will make it much easier for the average person to use BTC in their daily lives, and the market will be far healthier.

I had the same questions you're asking, and it was literally a paradigm shift in my way of thinking.

Not buying that desk retroactively earned you $25,000.\n\n4: You don't buy the desk, but you don't by $500 worth of bitcoin either. 3 years later bitcoin is $50,000. Not buying that bitcoin retroactively cost you $25,000.\n\nAs you can see, if you think about it, spending USD that you could be spending on bitcoin is no different than spending bitcoin directly.\n\nWhen you buy something with fiat instead of bitcoin, you're spending money that you could have traded into bitcoins that could have been worth many times more a few years down the road. It's the same thing.\n\nTLDR; BUY YOUR CRYPTO! SPEND YOUR CRYPTO!

It's one thing for Bob's Coffee Shop to get a custom terminal and take BTC via phone QR, but quite another for it to work in every retailer in the country. A real debit/credit card (as antiquated as it is) is a much faster path to adoption. Also good point re: transaction speed - it will get interesting once difficulty is crazy and miners have to subsist from transaction fees, will that be the point where commercial entities will have to start acting as miners to keep the ecosystem alive?\n\nWallets - Coinbase is essentially a wallet in the cloud, however if it goes out of business (or turns out to be a scam like some other exchanges, or loses liquidity, or etc etc), the users can get screwed. \n\nAs many problems as I see, I still think cryptocurrency is a very interesting idea, and am curious to see how it shakes out.": 3, "You're right, I bet early crypto investors are really enjoying themselves.

However, since you\'ve heard that all before, let\'s fast forward to the 9th inning -- what would the end game really look like?\n\nIMHO for BTC to be really usable by the average Joe/Josephine, we\'re gonna need:\n\n* Easy fiat conversion (i.e. Travelex easy)\n* Debit cards and ATM\'s\n* Fraud protection / chargebacks\n* Wallets in the "cloud" so that users can\'t lose them, along with insurance (FDIC) style protection for the company holding the wallet\n\nSo, basically what Bitcoin needs is real banking infrastructure. Once someone manages to do that (and gets over all the regulatory/technical/protocol hurdles), then the main selling point for the end consumer is that they can have a regular bank account only backed by something completely separate from government-controlled fiat currency. In other words, a Bank of America which isn\'t tied to USD. I\'ll call it "BTCBank". If the BTCBank is willing to instantly convert BTC->fiat, then you solve the adoption problem by essentially just giving people regular Mastercard/Visa and letting them use it anywhere they want (with BTCBank debiting your account at transaction time for whatever the conversion rate is, and giving the merchant their fiat). If there are multiple BTCBanks, then BTC is also being useful as a means to settle inter-bank transactions. Consumer would be protected from fiat / governmental issues, but would also inherit whatever the volatility of BTC value is. Also they\'d likely trade the above benefits for some loss of anonymity, since BTCBank would have problems if they give average users raw access to their wallets (i.e. fraud protection wouldn\'t work).\n\nA note: Even in this world, with lot of user adoption, the price of 1 BTC would still be hard to determine. Since there is no utility to BTC besides being an arbitrarily "weird" set of numbers, the value is really whatever people collectively decide it to be.

The only reason the internet really flourished is that it was (and still largely is) a government-backed project which kept a handful of the most critical choke points (such as root DNS servers) out of the reach or private corporations and their legal encumbrances. They almost screwed this up by gifting out large sections of another critical choke point, Class A IPv4 address ranges, to private corporations (who have largely wasted them) but fortunately it wasn\'t enough of a loss to cripple broad IP address adoption.\n\nBitcoin and the blockchain itself have no such protected common ground - it\'s a truly free market system which government protection will probably never be able to catch up with at this point. What chance does Bitcoin and related tech have to remain free with zero such protection when you consider that the internet itself, even with government control*** over key infrastructure segments, is already bleeding from wounds inflicted by patent troll maggots and apex predator corporations alike, a situation which is a minefield for businesses and developers to navigate, which weighs down everything you do online with an invisible, unpublished, un-voteable, private tax code in the form of royalties, takedown notices, and surprise C&D lawsuits.  \n\nAnd consider that while money is only one aspect of the internet\'s functionality, Bitcoin is literally nothing but money.

So if "all of november\'s transactions" on bitpay happened all at once, it would still not really rock the market.\n\nI personally have quite a sum, but other than token purchases at sellers that accept bitcoin (to support a rise in bitcoin\'s value by showing that accepting bitcoin = more sales), it isn\'t going to change my mind on where I spend my money.': 5, "Overstock's 2013 revenue is around $1.2-1.3 billion.

Overstock's share of the daily volume = less than 1/1000.\n\nThe real effect of Overstock.com is, it gives credibility to bitcoin, it keeps bitcoin in the news, and it increases the likelihood of other merchants joining.

If 'everyone' starts accepting bitcoin (even if they convert immediately back to USD), then this will bring up a new wave of people who work for a BTC paychecks and not USD.  Soon, their entire savings will be in BTC.  Why?  Because 'everyone' accepts it.  And as the value grows, it is only a matter of time before these merchants begin retaining part of their profits in BTC (either to pay employees, or to pay vendors).  Then we're to that moon.

Perhaps they were going to sell their bitcoin for Fiat anyway.\n\nYou don't know how the data stands either way for any of these claims - including your own.\n\nHere's one thing to consider though.  If overstock isn't holding bitcoin - and given coinbase would want to minimise its own risk by holding only as much bitcoin as it needs to satisfy demand - then it's likely that first day of trading worth of bitcoin has already hit the market.  Doesn't seem to have had an effect.": 0, 'Overstock reported $130k bitcoin revenue in one day. Bitstamp reports BTC 14k trade volume the past 24 hours, worth $13M.

I realize this is a possible scenario Bitcoin, but it is also possible with many things.  I am betting a total ban on Bitcoin is not carried out in the US nor will it be carried out in many Euro nations.  Yes, that is an assumption, but it is what I believe.  I also believe many small business owners will elect to retain profit in the form of BTC from BTC payments.  Even if employee paychecks cannot be in BTC, land lords and other small business owners will still save up BTC from their transactions.  And it makes sense, to me, as the dollar devalues by roughly 2-3% year after year.  \n\nPeople always put a lot of emphasis on the volatility of BTC.  What kept the USD stable in price when it was locked to the gold standard?  And if it wasn't stable, how did the economy still do so well in the 20's?  The trade off for perceived stability for the cost of devaluation just doesn't add up for me.  The issue you bring up with gold has many negative implications when it comes to storage and transportation.  If gold could be moved and stored as easily as BTC, I'm sure many people would still elect to receive payment in Gold.\n\nAnyways, I can foresee a future in which a small, but significant percentage of the world's population elects to live entirely off a form of crypto-currency.  Maybe it's Bitcoin, and maybe it's something else.  But as more and more merchants accept BTC payment, this will become a trendy thing to do.\n\n\n\n": 1, "You could set up smaller wallets to pay using BTC, tough to do with a debit card. If you don't want to put your debit card on a website, putting a public key of a wallet that only has .01BTC in it may bring someone a bit more comfort, as that is their maximum risk by doing that transaction. This point isn't as big of a deal with sites like overstock, but if you are dealing with a smaller unknown company this is a much bigger deal. \n\nAlso, if vendors see their fees drop significantly by more people adopting technology like BTC, then average prices from that vendor should eventually adjust (or at least take longer to increase in the future) because their profit margins are being impacted (in a positive way) by not having as many fees.\n\nIt may not be much, but it's certainly more than 'precisely zero'....": 3, 'There are two forms of adoption:  As a medium of exchange and as store of value.  Adoption as a medium of exchange might/should also encourage adoption as a store of value.  It is adoption as a store of value that will boost the price.  So I agree that people purchasing items through sites that convert to fiat is basically the same as selling and therefore puts a downward pressure on the market, but I can\'t see it plausible that this downward pressure wouldn\'t be more than offset by the affect that these announcements have on the adoption of bitcoin as a store of value.  \n\nOne of the biggest turnoffs for people I have spoken to about bitcoin has been my answer to the question "what can you buy with it?".  As my answer to that gets better I can only see more people concluding that they wouldn\'t mind holding some bitcoin putting pressure upwards.\n\nThis doesn\'t even consider that many purchasers on reddit report to replace the bitcoin that they spend thereby nullifying the effect on the market.': 2, 'While the first is a utility which Bitcoin has, again arguably this is rendered moot by the fact that fraud committed on debit and credit cards is refunded and that the consumer has chargeback rights should their card be debited without authority (often backed up by strong legislation e.g. the Consumer Credit Act in the UK, and the Payment Service Directive across the whole of the EU). There is also nothing stopping banks from introducing limited-amount one time card numbers - indeed, this has already been implemented by some banks - and using PayPal or even bank transfer also solves the issue by not allowing a payment to be "pulled" from it without express agreement (i.e. to pay a retailer you have to "push" the money to them). It\'s also arguable that there is any sizeable consumer demand for this facility - average Joe generally doesn\'t care too much.\n\nThe second point is a lot more speculative. While, yes, a reduction in fees might lead to those savings being passed in, it\'s debatable as to whether they would actually do so when they could simply treat it as an increase in profit margins. \n\nIt\'s also a bit of a chicken and egg problem, in that retailers won\'t see a significant drop in fees and be able to create the lower price incentive unless lots of consumers adopt Bitcoin, but lots of consumers won\'t adopt Bitcoin unless there is an incentive to do so. Right now, for the sort of person who behaves like the average retail banking customer (someone who gets their wages, pays their bills from their bank account, buys some groceries and maybe a few luxuries) there is very little Bitcoin could offer them right now, and a lot of the things it *could* potentially offer them are just that, potential.\n\nAlso, cheers for being more constructive than the /r/bitcoin guys... not that that\'s hard ;)': 3, "I had to double-check to make sure I wasn't on the Bitcoin subreddit. That reference to the moon there completely threw me off for a minute.\n\nI see you make an incredible number of assumptions there in your argument. One being that bitcoin will eventually grow to the point where it is no more volatile than the US dollar. I don't see bitcoin reaching this point as long as most people that hold BTC do so as a speculative investment, not as a tool of bartering. I know people say that bitcoin prices are slowly getting more stable over time, but the real thing to look at is whether the BTC will ever be as stable as the USD, something I have reservations about.\n\nThe second assumption is that people would be allowed to work for BTC paychecks. As long as BTC remains a novelty (which it does as of right now), the government will not care whether people are paid in BTC or USD. But you do realize that if the BTC becomes so popular to the point that more and more people start requesting to be paid in BTC, all it takes is one piece of government legislation to put the kibosh on such forms of remuneration.\n\nAnd that's even a rosy scenario. I don't see that many people opting for BTC paychecks over USD paychecks. Truth be told, I don't think many people have a problem being paid in USD, especially given that all taxes will have to be paid in USD anyway and all merchants accept USD anyway, whereas BTC may never see full adoption by merchants across the country.

There was a triple top at about 900 (Bitstamp), indicating that there was a significant level of resistance. \n\nIn general, when the market breaks upwards out of a period of consolidation, as what happened a couple days ago, the previous level of resistance is established as the new level of support. This was illustrated perfectly by the mini crash. The level of resistance during the consolidation period was about 830-840. This is the exact level that the price bounced off. \n\nWhat should you take away from this? If we decisively break below 820-830 on Bitstamp, expect a significant drop to the next resistance point (about 770-780). Until then, don't be surprised if we bounce around 850-900 for a while.

Continue monitoring the current range bound trading according to the resistance and support levels that you decide.  In the event that you feel the price is going to break out, you should analyze where you think the price can get to based on higher/lower resistance/support levels.  For example, if the price were to break out to the upside, then the next levels of resistance look to be at 900 and 930.  You'd then have to calculate potential returns from trading on the breakout, and whether its worth it for you to make a trade.

Does anyone know if this has been done before?\n\nSomething else I haven't seen yet is the ability to place orders and set priority of execution, so for example if I have a long position (1), I would want to set a sell (2) followed by a possible short sell (3) and so on.\n\nThis: http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1upmbt/new_alt_currencies_exchange_for_professional/ was posted yesterday with users responding with feature requests they'd like to see.": 1, "yeah it doesn't need to be open source to be trusted with key pairs... \n\nThat's how https://cryptrader.com works too!": 1, 'What I would like from QT trader or any other trading bot would be the ability to set up sequential and concurrent orders in one group as you please.\n\nEx: Order 1: buy at $1000. order 2: If price goes above 1050, sell. order 3: If price goes below 950, buy. order 4: (sequential to order 2) if price goes below 1000, buy. etc etc.': 1, "Yeah, priorities sounds like a great feature.

Unless there is something changing on Jan 31 that is not already made publicly aware, then there is no reason the market hasn't already reflected this information.

If there is still money to be made until the 31st, Chinese with skin in the game will play until it isn't profitable anymore, and likely get out before restriction make it difficult to exchange back to CNY. If most Chinese holders are in fact just small-time netizens hoping to make a bit of profit they're not going to want to stay in BTC once the 31st restrictions come in. They will, however, stay in as long as possible while the price keeps rising.": 5, 'Hence the "kind of" suffix in my post. Good pointing that out though!': 1, 'I still pretty strongly disagree, not going to downvote though because its a solid different perspective and the kind of questions that are good to ask.\n\n>I posit that a strong incentive for Chinese players is getting around capital control laws, and thus there is little incentive to rush back in into RMB come Jan 31st.\n\nOf course, but this incentive will largely apply to the strong and dedicated traders. You have to keep in mind the vast majority of those using exchanges simply aren\'t the type of trader to be tuned into places like BitcoinMarkets, and a lot of it is casual investing. People who are wanting in to make a quick buck, rather than those who are hedging for long term positions.\n\nThose strong long-term holders can likely continue to trade bitcoin using these backdoor methods, but the government shutting down avenues for easy access is what is going to kill volume, and it already has had an impact. That volume is how the market grows in the first place. Without that volume, how can we expect the chineese as a market to ever grow? It won\'t. \n\nOne of the reasons that Bitcoin worldwide hasn\'t gone absolutely viral yet largely has to do with how hard it is to get bitcoin even with normal exchanges. Currently the easiest option is Coinbase, but its only open to those with US bank accounts, requires a lot of waiting if you are new, has plenty of fees, etc. When the government offically makes it even -harder- to aquire bitcoins, it will destroy any real growth potential that market can have.\n\n>Further, what mindset does a Chinese person holding lots of btc have that has them wait until right before Jan 31st to dump their coins? Why would they not being doing it now, slowly, if they really were trying to get out? Wouldn\'t they see the writing on the wall, know there are others like them and try and get out "first"?\n\nMany are doing it now and have already done it. That said, why leave now if you don\'t have to leave till the 31st? Especially as the price rises in the interim? Its the same reason why people tend to simply get projects done and turn them in when they are due vs getting it done early. There is no point to really getting out now if you are looking to make as much money as possible most efficiently when you don\'t have to worry about that just yet. Especially when there are signals of the price going up in the meantime.\n\n>The more I think about it, I more expect panic buying as we near the date if it does indeed look like it will stop all RMB->Exchange transfers; as my understanding is that there is a significant subset of the population in China that is RMB flush, but not able to get their assets out of China easily; and if the main motivator for the people is moving capital; they have little incentive to re-lockup their cash by selling their crypto.\n\nThis is a plausible situation - but the result would be the same in the end I think, except the big drop might happen a little bit after when that well dries completely up, rather than before. \n\nHowever the only reason why I do not see this as happening, is that we are already getting price rises right now. Price trends and history removed from all news/outside forces is the strongest force on the future price in an market. If the price rises already happened earlier this month (i.e. right now), it makes it that much more unlikely it\'ll suddenly shoot up at the end on of the month UNLESS a true new trend is started and the price increases keep happening.\n\nI think that is highly doubtful, because of where we were a month ago.\n\n>I\'d really like to hear from those who are convinced than Jan 31st is "not yet priced in" the mindset of a holder of bitcoin who still holds coins but will definitely have sold them by Feb 1 since that is when the turning point happens.\n\nTo close, I think we will see more lows before this roller coaster ride is over. Its not yet priced in, because there are still people clearly trading, and there is no reason to not trade as long as you still have the freedom to do so till the 31st if you are in china. Some of it is priced in though - a lot of the drops we got were likely due to this news. And a lot of the buying in we are seeing now is people hopping back on to make a bit more money before its too late.\n\nReguardless, the volume speaks everything. This current price rise is of signifigantly less volume than the actual bubble\'s rise. People are already out and not getting back in just yet. The price can rise so much right now, because not nearly as many people are needed to push it up as before. This doesn\'t spell good things for the near future in my mind. The higher it gets at this low volume state, the easier it will be for it to fall very hard.': 8, '*Simple Question*\n\nWhat is the work around for China BTC holders?\n\nIf you hold 100k CNY worth of BTC how to you cashout?\n\n<current state> ...\nhttp://www.ofnumbers.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/btcc-voucher.jpg\n\n': 2, 'And now this is the top comment': 14, "hmmm.. bear here, and I still very much share your sentiment.

The deadline is for third party payment processors to cease business with Bitcoin exchanges and other Bitcoin related businesses.  That has been done.\n\nExchanges are now accepting deposits through direct bank payment.  At first, I thought this was a last-ditch work-around, and that the government would shut these down as well.  However, I believe I was incorrect.  These exchanges have been openly using these methods for deposit and withdrawal without any problems from the government.\n\nThe deadline is irrelevant now, regardless.  The payment methods being used are not those mentioned in the deadline.  Those payment methods are essentially gone already.  Maybe some websites like BTC China still allow withdrawal with them, but who cares?  99% of the volume in China is being done with vouches / bank transfer.\n\nPeople need to stop focusing on the deadline.  There is no doomsday being set for BTC.  If this was truly what was awaiting, the government wouldn't allow exchanges to re-open business through alternative payment methods.  It's setting people up for disaster, which is something they openly looked to avoid.\n\nThe risk with China now goes back underground.  It's a bit scary, really.  At any point they could come in and decide to put a new restriction on BTC, or ban it all together.  I don't think either scenario could be considered as shocking.  Or, they could just let it carry on silently, without further input.  We really just don't know now.  We can definitely see reasons as to why they would decide to ban BTC or regulate it further (capital controls, high risk to investors, etc.), but we have no idea when and how it would be done.\n\nWithout some new inside information, China is a mystery again.

I know that sounds stupid.  I am just using the nomenclature they use for setting these up.\n\nThink of them like this:  When the column of Xs exceeds the previous column of Xs by one box it is indicative of the buying pressure overwhelming the sell side.  In stocks [and this is different because its new] that is the best time to buy with the lowest risk.  In stocks, you will have a 30+% gain in over the average of the next four months.  This is accurate some 80% of the time.  The opposite is true on the sell side, and the time frame is a little quicker.\n\nThat is a guideline.  This Bitcoin does not act like a stock that way, it moves a lot faster and in wider swatches.  BUT, when that column punches up from the last colume of Xs and a buy signal is triggered, the thing has gone up a lot, and fast.\n\nThe Tall pole warning is where the column of Xs has risen above the last formation by at least four boxes.  I think this makes common sense--if it is rising too fast without significant relief it will come back some.  Think of a tall pole standing without support.  The taller the pole, the more likely its coming down.  So, the warning is based on half of the rise.  In this case the rise was 29 boxes, from 710 to 990 (bitstamp), therefore the warning sign of a larger drop would be at 14-15 boxes (pick\'em).  So, when it falls to that warning sign you should be paying attention.  If it goes much further down, it is a sign its going down further (again, common sense.)  So, I watched for a while and bailed around 830.  I bought in those shares at an average of 680 or so over the past couple of weeks.  So, I protected my profits.\n\nThen it bounces around for a couple of days and will go down further or start back up.

Yesterday it triggered a High Pole Warning signal at $860, which was a drop of 1/2 of the way down the spike to the most recent high.  This morning that trend continued down to a current formation low of $762.  The failure to hold the warning sign led to the sale of our trading BTC at the $830 mark.  Reentry would be upon reversal back up the pole, or the establishment of a new "buy" signal in the formation.\n\nThe formation has set up a new "Buy Signal" at $1,000.  The "sell signal" moved up to $690.\n\nWe remain in an up-trend, with the reversal point at $430, the upward-to-the-right trend from the previous sell signal column.  The long term, original bullish support line is 128.\n\nVolume continued to ramp back up towards pre-year end amounts.  I think we will have to see how a return to normal affects the stock price.\n\nMy concerns at this point is whether or not BTC is still operating in its manic/bubble phase.  The price action reflects the bubble graphs pretty closely, which means we may be in for a sharp decline back to the mean, which in this case would bring us back to near $600 levels (I am simply eyeballing it.)  A revert to the "pre-bubble" support level would be about $130.

I either want it 100% perfect, or to 100% fail and most No SQL implementations can\'t do that yet, or at least not without some serious limitations (no nested statements such as in HyperDex).  1 in a million might not sound like much but for a system that would process millions of transactions that have to be perfect, it\'s too much of a risk.\n\nNow, enough tech talk, on to features.

What i mean is, people see stable prices and expect a movement, and I think most people were betting that movement would be up just based on long-run data. \n\nThe recent mini-run was just an assumption by a few, i think, that BTC would appreciate inevitably. However, the volume was so low that it quickly got taken out. We went from the bottom band early january (in a 6-month viewing period, what i consider long term in the BTC world) to the top of the band 2 days ago. From a technical perspective, we poked the top of the band as a test, and prices obviously fell due to lack of support to push outside of it.\n\nObviously the chinese news also plays a role, although i think that most of that is over and priced-in, not to mention any private information that has already been acted on. \n\nHowever, I don\'t agree with your comment "any price over 800 is exuberant," which seems arbitrary. I assume you\'re just looking at a long-run pricing band and saying, "oh, 800 is in the middle of this band!" That thinking is justifiable, but long term technical trading is an absolute joke. \n\n"I don\'t expect a big push for another 4-6 months" also seems ridiculous.

Double spend is difficult to do, and if you\'re shipping something, you can simply have your software wait 60 minutes before sending the confirmation email (which is by no means a long wait when it comes to shipping things sold online).\n\nTransaction fees "can" get more expensive over time, if you want them to be. You can set your transaction fee to whatever you like, and the miner who actually mines the next block determines if your fee is big enough that they\'ll include it in the block or not. If they don\'t, you get passed off to the next block. So nobody is forcing you to pay more in transaction fees, you\'re just trying to bump to the front of the line (and there is a proposal to make each block include more transactions to compensate for increased bitcoin movement).\n\nSure you can say the blockchain is bad for the enviroment, but at a total-yearly-cost in the less-than-10-million dollar range for the elctricity, the cost is negligable. How much do you think Visa\'s server farms, or paypal\'s server farms cost to maintain their payment networks? I can assure you it is far more.\n\nYou list "no private transactions" as a detraction, but that isn\'t really true. Your transactions are private from the vast majority of users, only people with access to your fiat-to-bitcoin transaction points can actually track who you are and what you\'re spending. Which gives you about the same level of security as credit-card-transactions. So at best, it is a neutral point, and with careful use of bitcoin mixers you can actually get more security than traditional transactions.': 6, '> Can somebody explain to me what it aims to achieve\n\nbitcoin is **decentralize peer-to-peer digital transaction system**, that\'s it.\n\nto achieve that, bitcoin produce side effects :\n\n* since it is **digital**, you need to store monetary value into digital form, thats why we see bitcoin (BTC) can be exchanged into fiat currency\n* to store a value into digital form, bitcoin need currency publishing system (system to create BTC), where user will convert or exchange their fiat currency into "BTC". this **creation** system done by miner through mining\n* to move that value (transact) from address to address, bitcoin need **transaction** processing system, this is where miner come in to store and keep the record of public ledger, as a reward miner will get transaction fee and before 2050 miner will rewarded a prize of BTC (this is where btc is created)\n* since bitcoin wants **decentralized** system, there can\'t be only one miner or institution, so bitcoin need miner network which is should be peer-to-peer, no server or whatever\n* since bitcoin is run by millions of miners, the next problem is how do we make all miner agree into one **public ledger** (blockchain)? to achieve this, we need to make writing public ledger is time consuming, so that only one miner can come up with a valid next block within 10 minutes.\n* to make it time consuming, bitcoin need a hard problem to write a next block on public ledger, this problem is so hard that no computer can solve it in short time, the best way to solve it is just put random answer and we hope our guess is correct, this guessing process is called **hashing**, the more hash you do, the more chance you come with correct answer\n\nbecause of that effects, bitcoin is a **store of value**, **transaction system**, a **bank** that create a token and a **tradeable** currency\n\n': 1, 'Wrong sub for this. /r/bitcoin is where you should be.

Currency markets *and* commodity markets are far more accessible than BTC markets right now.\n\nAnd I have a hard time believing that at present there is a real and direct relationship between the value of a local currency and the value of BTC.

The value of a currency should be measured using it's relative purchasing power.  \n\nThe purchasing power of 1 BTC when it was at its all-time high was not the same as 1 BTC where it is now. If I purchased BTC at its peak, I would have ~10% less relative value today.  \n\nFiat currency under a well governed central bank protects purchasing power much more than a currency that derives its value exclusively through demand forces.  Deflation can be just a destructive as inflation, and BTC has no controls to mitigate Deflation.  \n\nFurthermore, a finite supply of BTC makes the currency extremely vulnerable to manipulation by whales. As it stands, less than 1,000 people own over half of the bitcoin in the market.  With trading and transaction volume as low as it is, even a small movement by one of those whales would have serious ramifications for the purchasing power of all bitcoin holders.  \n\n": -1, 'But at that point your scrap of paper would become worthless as well.

Look into the Network Effect for a rationale of why this can still be expected to grow for a while longer. As the Bitcoin ecosystem grows, it logically becomes more attractive to participate in it, since you can acquire a wider variety of goods/services within it should you choose to do so. \n\nTL;DR: S-curve ': 5, "First of all, it is not logarithmic growth, but rather exponential growth. \n\nThe reason that bitcoin grows at an exponential rate right now is easy to show. For simplicity's sake, suppose that all people are either bitcoiners or not, and suppose that the number of bitcoiners in the world at time t is denoted N(t). Then, on average suppose that each bitcoiner tells X people about bitcoin per unit time and R of those X become bitcoiners. Then R is the rate at which bitcoin adds users. Therefore, we can write an equation for the rate that N(t) changes in time,\n\ndN/dt = N(t)*R,\n\nin words, bitcoin gains new bitcoiners per unit time equal to the number of current users times the rate at which they are added. We can see then that the more people that are bitcoiners, the more they increase the rate of new users. We can solve this differential equation easily as the solution is well known. You can check that this\n\nN(t) = e^(Rt)\n\nis a solution to our differential equation with the boundary condition that N(0) = 1 (as it was only Satoshi at t=0). \n\nNow if we assume that each bitcoiner invests on average an amount of money into bitcoin, call it M, then the total amount invested in bitcoin as a function of time, A(t), can be written\n\nA(t) = Me^(Rt)\n\nThus we see that the total amount invested in bitcoin should grow exponentially. If we assume that the amount invested in bitcoin and the price of bitcoin are approximately linearly related (a reasonable assumption which I can backup if anyone actually reads this far), then the price will also rise exponentially. \n\nThe key assumption in this analysis is that we have assumed an unlimited pool of new people that can be converted into bitcoiners. This is obviously not the case and eventually everyone in the world will have some knowledge regarding bitcoin and will have made their ultimate decision regarding adoption. At this point our assumption fails and exponential growth will stop. However, this does not mean that price growth must stop.

But, it's a consideration. Those costs are a tax on all Bitcoin users. Possibly a necessary tax, we don't know yet (Peercoin tries to solve that one, I don't know if it has solved it, or will be a relevant contender).\n\nOther cryptocurrencies can plausibly replace Bitcoin at some future date. Maybe five years from now, we'll look back and think how ridiculous it seemed for everyone to be betting so much on Bitcoin, when it was the first of its kind, and the barrier to entry on creating competitors (real competitors...I don't consider all of the Bitcoin forks competitors; I mean something novel that solves one or more problems of Bitcoin, again, possibly something on the Peercoin evolutionary branch).\n\nEvery government on earth could make Bitcoin illegal (which is not all that unlikely, given how states throughout history have cracked down on private currencies). Would that stop Bitcoin? No, I don't think it would.

In five years, I expect Bitcoin to be a huge part of the world economy, and I have placed my bets accordingly. But, I don't think your scenario is the only scenario.

Similarly, if you had the world\'s only telephone, it\'s worthless (other than looking like a rich BSD), but the more telephone users exist, the more valuable your asset becomes. \n\nso you have supply increasing at a decreasing rate, and demand increasing at an increasing rate.

The value of a bitcoin is just a collective idea.\n\nAs more and more people hear about it, and digest the information, then realize what a trustless ledger of ownership does, the demand for Bitcoin gradually increases. But it increases exponentially, like any viral phenomenon, because our networks propagate information that way. Each success story breeds more new demand, and that demand has to compete for an increasingly scarce thing - bitcoins for sale. This drives the price up. Thus, price is an exponential like curve.\n\nAlso note that while it looks exponential now, there probably will be a saturation point, meaning that the growth is actually sigmoidal. If you look into the historical price, you can see "steps" of this sigmoidal growth in any year. My hypothesis for this is that there are slightly insular groups of thought, and Bitcoin breaks into and saturates each one. The one it\'s breaking into right now is Wall St. Before that it was Chinese investors at large (supposedly). Before that it was maybe the people on Silk Road. Before that it was maybe only cryptography and economy enthusiasts.
