Let\'s say ETH price rises 10%, suddenly its "market cap" goes from $1.0 Bn up by $100M. **What use at all is this arbitrary $100M, vis-a-vis Bitcoin?** Ofc there isn\'t anywhere remotely close to $100M of BTC, USD, ETH moving around anywhere.

From a glance at Kraken\'s market, there is fairly limited ETHEUR/USD depth such that the grand total of ETH you could buy is equivalent to about 300BTC worth. And needless to say, selling 300BTC (~100K USD or EUR) would hardly make a blip on BTC markets as a whole. \n\nIn fact, speaking to actual fiat value moving between ETH or BTC, it would be equivalent to the the profit from arbitrage, which would be 10% of 300BTC, or 30BTC. \n\nSo for a $100M "market cap" increase to ETH, there\'s negligible "market cap" decrease to BTC, and in reality about 30BTC = $12,000USD "moved" between the two cryptos.

If we account for the other exchanges the figure might be in the 1,500-2000BTC. So you can cash out around $700K without moving the price much.\n\nEth on the other hand has only a couple exchanges and the figure is in the 30-40BTC. So to move the price with the same %, you only need $15k. Yet, ETH has 15% of the market cap of bitcoin.\n\nSo if you have $700K of wealth in bitcoin, or $15k of wealth in Eth, the market cap is quite accurate for you.

And if you send 100 BTC after waiting 100 days, you destroy 10,000 Bitcoin days.\n\nThe number just means "How many bitcoins have been transferred multiplied by how long those bitcoins have remained dormant prior to the transfer". It\'s a much less manipulable metric because you can\'t just send 1 coin back and forth to yourself to inflate it, you\'d have to wait a long time before sending it again to maximize your BDD.\n\nIf there is a spike in BDD, it means that a lot of coins that haven\'t moved in a long time have just moved.

This isn\'t a multi-billion dollar economy considering nobody (in any significant volume for a global currency) shops with it or uses it for remittances. I don\'t think the price will necessarily tank if/when Classic gains favor (nor vice-versa if Core remains) but rather that no additional speculative value (price increases) will occur during this uncertainty. Once the path forward is clear perhaps the price can resume appreciating but I figure we\'ll linger in this tight channel until that occurs.\n\nIf the struggle for power goes on much longer Bitcoin will continue to seep out the current speculative value it holds as owners lose faith in the eventual "success" of Bitcoin. \n\nTL,DR: Whether classic gains support or Core holds it, the price isn\'t going anywhere until we have an answer. There\'s nothing but the resolution of this war to look forward to - 21 is a non-issue for growth and so is OB. No catalysts on the horizon and even when the blocksize debate is sorted I\'m not sure Bitcoins can justify the current value/market cap without more economic use. Other cryptocurrencies are starting to gain favor on the strictly cryptocurrency side of things and most business users seem content with foregoing Bitcoin use for their own blockchains\n\n\n\n\n': 4, "I think that tis the most likely scenario that bitcoin will end up with.

I speculate bitcoin based on price and I personally believe that price is forward looking to bitcoin's future, just like stock index is forward looking to the economy. If price tanks here, it will be doom and gloom in the short term. If we just chop around, then people are waiting for news to break; halving, segwit release and classic support.

So nicely, we have some significant changes in the chart and the patterns.\n\nFirst, we went down to a low of $399.  But we bounced pretty quickly right back into the $400s.  The beauty of this move is that we reached a higher low than the last column.  And since it has gone back up to $415 (just a few minutes ago) we breached the trend line coming down from the $445 box.  \n\nThe trend is now reversed to a positive trend.  And since it is a positive trend, I can increase my optimism.\n\nOf course, with swings as wild as we have had, the negative trend is just a couple of boxes away.  We need only fall below $405 to hit that again.  During times of consolidation, these things can swing from one direction to the other in minutes.  \n\nThe positive break out would occur at $425.

So, while we are \xe2\x80\x9ctechnically\xe2\x80\x9d in a new trend, it is tenuous at best.\n\nThe best news of the weekend is that the high of today brought us up to the point where our formation now contains 9 columns.  That means that the pressure in play is STILL pretty significant.\n\nIf we were ONLY at the reversal point I would be concerned about a bull trap.  But because it popped up fast, and followed through today that case is less likely.\n\nSo what do I think?\n\nI am thinking that we will probably see another try at $420.  If we can break through that will some strength and speed, I think the battle will be won, and the bulls will  be in  charge for a few days.  My guess is if we hit $422 or higher will are more likely to see $450 than $400.\n\nAnd\xe2\x80\xa6here in Mass. we are getting, hopefully, the last snow storm of the season.

If you think that can keep moving--at that rate -- you would have to believe in Skittle-Shiting-Unicorns that can fly.  If you see the Dow drop to below 17450, that sucker is going down another 300 points.  And that would be 1/2 the column.  It could drop a LOT more than that.\n\nThe SP chart shows that we are on our sixth visit to this level since the end of 2014.  Now, normally I would be thinking, "Wow, this may be the time we finally \'make it\' to new all time highs."  I WOULD think that if the Dow was not going stratospheric.  Yes...I think we are in for a helluva week or two.

Speculation drives volatility and keeps Bitcoin from a price determined sufficiently by transactions demand (the part of the demand curve determined by a consumer\'s intention to trade bitcoin for goods).  In a market where there was no incentive to hold bitcoin except to be able to trade it for consumption goods in the future, the clearing price would be a perfect indicator of the value of the "currency" (I use scare quotes because it is controversial whether Bitcoin is a currency or not).\n\nHowever, much of that demand (if you can tell how much you can probably win a nobel in econ) is attributable to speculation and acts as a multiplier, sending prices alternatively soaring and crashing depending on small changes in underlying fundamental aspects of the currency (the small actual transactions demand) and completely masking true demand as traders try to predict one-another\'s moves based on exogenous variables like national regulatory frameworks, etc.\n\nVolatility in turn increases speculative demand (traders only make money when the market moves up and down, not sideways) and discourages transactions demand (decreasing marginal utilities of income make consumers wary of holding volatile currencies), almost guaranteeing that widespread adoption will not occur.  \n\nThe paradox of Bitcoin is that, until widespread adoption does occur, Bitcoin will be seen as a good way to speculate and as long as it is seen as a speculative bet, widespread adoption will not occur.\n\nThe real potential of this amazing technology will only be realized when short-term traders\' demand for Bitcoin becomes significantly lower relative to transactions demand.

Bitcoin releases blocks on a schedule that has been predetermined and, as such, is immune to monetary policies that may work for or against "holders" of currency.\n\nTo put it another way, let us imagine all money will be worthless tomorrow.  Who would hold money overnight?  No-one.  It would all be spent today and no-one would demand it as a store of value.  As demand for money dropped to nothing, the prices of goods in money would skyrocket.  This is inflation (albeit on an absurd scale).  If the value of money drops enough due to inflation, it becomes worthless as currency and it would fail the on this account.\n\nTaking a step back, we can now understand that (fiat) money will be of value only as long as there are people who will wish to hold it for the future in lieu of goods.  [Note: This is sometimes called the Overlapping Generations Model when introducing the problem of wanting to smooth consumption between periods.]\n\nIf consumers believe money will be worth less in the future, they will spend more now, which also has dynamic effects to increase inflation.\n\nIf they believe money will be worth more in the future, they will wait to spend it, adjusting consumption to future periods.  This is a deflationary situation -- also with dynamic effects.\n\nThe problem with the comparison to Bitcoin is that there is a very definite schedule which anyone can understand.  If we look at Bitcoin\'s float over two periods and we know the algorithm, we can know EXACTLY how many coins will be available at any one time (OK, not exactly, but close enough for hand grenades).  This means that any inflation effects due to "money" supply increases will have been accounted for and present value will always be a perfect reflection of transactions demand as long as there is no speculation demand.\n\nThis is not so with national currencies.  There is a way that national currencies can be more like Bitcoin with respect to the eminently predictable monetary policy; it is called "rules-based monetary policy".  I believe there are currently zero rules-based monetary policies in the world (which would be something akin to a software algorithm determining monetary policy without human intervention), therefore the comparison is specious at best and harmful to understanding at least.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto, whoever the hell he/she/it/they is/are, has crafted an elegant and wonderful invention that will change the world in ways we can\'t even imagine right now.

BTC price fluctuation != inflation.  Everyone on this board keeps abusing the term "inflation" when what they really mean is "depreciation".  Money supply growth is what I mean when I say inflation -- not changes in the price of BTC.  \n\nIf what you mean is actually inflation then yes, money supply growth = inflation.  Read on.  Gotta keep that straight for the rest of this to make sense.\n\nThe term inflation comes from the notion that the money supply is being diluted (inflated) with intrinsically worthless fiat currency.  As more currency chases the same number of goods, the price of the goods rises in direct proportion to the growth of the money supply.\n\nEcon 101 lesson over. Monetary Econ lesson about to begin:\n\nLet\'s say there are M^t coins in circulation in period t and a full one-third are lost in the period they are mined.  Specifically, this would mean that, for every block mined (M^t - M^t-1 / M^t )in period t, 1/M^t / 3 are lost in that period. \n\nWe are not, then, talking about a comparison between what we think the money supply is and what it truly is -- we are talking about a fundamental miscalculation of the true *rate* of coin generation (increase in nominal BTC availability = increase in perceived money supply vs. increase in real BTC availability = increase in actual money supply), in which case, suddenly finding that we have *fewer* coins than we thought we did would lead to a finding of a miscalculation of the **rate** of money growth heretofore, and, therefore, a comparable *deflation* of the money supply relative to what we thought it had been.\n\nBut none of these things matter to inflation (money supply growth) and here is why, if we assume that BTC is still being lost at a similar rate, since coins are fungible, there is absolutely NO EFFECT on the money growth rate (BTC "inflation"):\n\n* Let the perceived money supply M in period t be denoted **M^t**\n* Let the perceived money supply M in period t+1 be denoted **M^t+1**\n* Let the gross money supply growth rate between two consecutive periods = **M^t+1 / M^t**\n* Let the money growth rate described above be denoted **z**\nIf one third of all coins that are generated from t=0 through to the current period are suddenly lost, the rate of growth in the money supply through the next period is:\n\nM^t+1 / 3 / M^t\nIf M^t+1, for example is 12 BTC and M^t is 10 BTC, z = 4/10 = .40 money growth rate.  Whoops!  This is *massive deflation*!  As it should be!  Losing a bunch of coins suddenly deflates the currency, as I originally stated.\n\nThe reason the loss of BTC is not perceived as deflationary (and who in God\'s name would ever think losing coins could be *inflationary*), is because the loss occurred at a *steady rate*.  There was no sudden loss of coins -- it was only a misperception.\n   \nTo illustrate:\n\nIf money supply in both periods \n\n* (M^t / M^t+1 )^perceived = z^perceived \n* (M^t / 3 / M^t+1 / 3 )^actual = z^actual \n\nz^perceived = z^actual and there is no difference in actual inflation rate.\n\nNow look at your last reply.  \n* Where you have *x*, I have M^t+1 - M^t\n* Where you have *y*, I have M^t\n* Rearranged a bit, our definition of *net* money growth rate agrees in this way: x/y = {( M^t+1 / M^t ) - 1}\n* Where your assessment fails is the assumption of a sudden decrease in M^t.  There was no real decrease in M^t, only a misperception of the true M^t=i where i is an element of the set of all periods of BTC existence (people are wrong now and were always wrong).\n* Since we are talking about future periods when we talk about inflation, your calculation should be \n\n* M^t+1 = ( 1^millionAdditionalCoinsMined - 4^millionCoinsLost)\n* M^t = 14^millionCoinsInCurrentPeriod\n\n**( M^t+1 - M^t ) / M^t  = 1 - 4 / 14 = -.21** inflation rate, which is, again, *de*flation\n\n\nBonus BTC Econ Lesson for reading through to the end:\n\nBTC is immune to inflation because there can be no "surprise" money growth.  There will be 21 million coins someday in the middle of the 22nd century and then no more forever.  So it is written; so shall it be.  \n\nBecause of this, you can think of the total supply of BTC over time as 21E9 and forget all this nonsense about inflation.  There is no inflation because there *is no surprise*.  Markets discount future certainties into the price of present values, just as I stated in my previous post before I was accused of "transcribing an econ textbook in lieu of answering a question" or some such nonsense.\n\nMaybe it sounds like a textbook to you because it is textbook econ.

This will be confirmed by the end of the day today.\n\nThe down turn also took out the trend line and reset the trend to a negative bias (the little blue crosses) and the price would have to exceed $425 to reverse the trend back to a bullish bias.  Therefore, whenever I am making a prediction  about which way the chart may go, I take into consideration the  bias of the trend.\n\nSo, here are the new settings:\n\nWe had a negative breakdown.  So the target while we are still in this formation would be about $375.  I would think a strong bounce off of $380 would confirm this as the near term bottom.\n\nThe trend line was broken, so in order to revert to a positive bias, the price would need to exceed $425.\n\nOur next positive break out is also at $425.

IMO it's just plain fascinating. \n\nSome people are calling for a crash because the network is becoming more expensive/troublesome/slower to use. Generally, I would agree that this was very bearish, but the thing it, this is happening because adoption is going up. \n\nSome users are worried that, in the event this fee market plays out until SegWit, fees will get too high for Bitcoin to offer any sort of advantage over services like paypal. I can understand that concern from a user standpoint, but there is a reason I'm posting here and not in /r/bitcoin. I am here to make money. If somehow the average fee paid to get in the next block gets all the way up to 25 cents... 1 dollar... 10 dollars... or whatever they may think is the breaking point for them, you have to realize that it got there because the demand caused it to get there.\n\nAt the same time, I don't see it as bullish. Why? Well it's caused me to be more hesitant to be holding right now, and I expect it's doing the same for a lot of other holders. I already said that I don't see it as bearish, but I know that plenty of traders/holders will, so I have to take that into account. \n\nI'm very excited to see how it works out. Classic is out there. Altcoins are out there. The Bitcoin market and cryptocurrency market needs some time to see what path is the best path forward. Internet discussions will never end in consensus. Humans are stubborn, prideful creatures. Persuading others from their initial stance is rarely accomplished. Sometimes the situation has to play out by having consequences become realized. \n\nPersonally, if I had to guess right now, I think that if this kind of network activity keeps up for an extended duration, we will reach a point where the high-priority fee level will plateau. I predict that will be somewhere around .0003-.0005 btc fees per transaction. Blockstream/core and the miners saw this coming. RBF being implemented was indication that the developers saw this coming. Miners are hoping it pulls in extra money through fees. I don't think blockstream is going to cave unless miners start switching to classic. I don't see miners switching to classic until their business becomes less profitable. With rising fees, there business becomes more profitable, but only as long as the price doesn't crash. They are still much more dependent on block rewards for income than fees. \n\nIt's times like this that I really do have some faith in the free market to work itself out. It's a fairly complex negative feedback loop that will eventually resolve itself. I'm infinitely more confident in the free market working itself out than I am in groups of developers and miners all trying to reach a consensus. \n\nMy trading advice: Zoom out and look at the weekly.

': 2, 'The most important thing you can do right now is to take a step back, assess your position and goals, and write out a full strategy for short, mid and long-term. I mean it -- open up a Google doc or whatever and write it all out. Why did you invest? Are you speculating each BTC will be $1MM in the future? If it went up to $5k would you sell a portion? How much? What if you had enough suddenly to buy that car you\'ve been wanting, or a down payment on a house? And if it went down to $200 what does that mean? Would you sell it all forever and put that money into stocks? Or will you simply hold on to it and hope it goes back up?\n\nThe worst thing you can do is react according to your emotions when you see a large drop or spike. And unless you have it written down or are a stoic (you\'re not), you will definitely react to those emotions. With a plan all written out, you don\'t have to make a choice anymore. You just look at your plan and say "oh hey bitcoin hit $600, I\'m going to sell 5% of my holdings as written according to my investment plan" or whatever. And that also prevents you from investing MORE during a huge rise, which may be the top of a bubble (you never know).\n\nIf you feel you are over-invested and are losing sleep over it, there is absolutely nothing wrong with reducing your position if it allows you to be at ease. Who cares about lost potential gains or any of that -- the psychological benefit of feeling comfortable and not checking the price ever 10 seconds is worth more than any amount of money. You should have enough where you feel excited about the potential, but if it drops in half you are able to shrug it off and focus on other things. Do you have a 6 month emergency fund in a savings account? What about an IRA or 401k? That should all be part of your investment strategy (and all written out) because the same stuff happens in almost every investment (e.g. the amount of people that sold their stocks after the 2008 crisis at the bottom is insane...if they had a strategy written out and stuck to it they wouldn\'t have lost half their wealth).\n\nLike it or not, cryptocurrency is still new and considered speculative, so think of it that way: how much of your net worth should be locked up in a speculative investment that could drop to $0 overnight?\n\nFor more info read up: https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Investment_policy_statement': 13, 'Probably the opposite, if classic really takes over, I expect a major drop in price.': 5, 'http://imgur.com/ciINCB0': 1, 'This whole exercise reinforces my belief that there will be no major rally until very few people believe there will be a major rally.\n\nThe first rule of fight club is that you do not talk about fight club.': 5, 'Unless it goes back up and you have to buy back in higher :P': 1, 'Got all that margin-call money for rocket fuel.': 4, "Thank you for the great input.

During that period I collected nearly 6 bitcoins when it was in the $200 range. Now i\'m sitting on top of nealry $4,000 from selling off my btc when the prices pumped to $450. It is all about how each miner handles their own btc. I for one held onto mine for months until the price rose dramatically. Sure I sold a little bit off once we hit $350/$380. \n\n6 months ago I wasn\'t mining at a loss either. The difficulty was low and the reward was valued for what it was. I was easily paying for my hardware due to the low difficulty and handsom payout. If the price per bitcoin starts to flatline who knows what will happen. Sure the Chinese miners are mining for a lesser value, but you also need to think about what they\'re spending on their own hardware. \n\nI for one do not agree on the "coins won\'t be mined if it\'s not X amount of dollars." I believe that the small time miners that aren\'t running farms in their garages will be pulled offline. Due to the high difficulty and low value of bitcoin. There would be no point for people with less than a Th/s or two to even consider mining unless they are perfectly ok with burning money for the network. There would be absolutely no point in mining at that point in time unless their pure goal is just to support the network. \n\nA lot of people that got into mining, including myself, started mining because there was a profit to be made. Sure there are miners out there that are purely doing it just to support the network, but a vast majority of the major powerhouse users out there are still mining for a profit. people with Terrahashes of power would more than likely not continue to throw money away on thousands of dollars on equipment that isn\'t creating a return in revenue. \n\nIt will depend on each miner at what point they will stop mining at. I for one, and a few of my friends, will be taking our equipment offline if mining becomes unprofitable. It\'d be a better "investment" in buying Bitcoin out right than just mining for it and hoping for a return from our investments. \n\ntl;dr I saved my Bitcoin back in $220 days, sold some in december, sold lots a few weeks ago.

Mining at a loss can be considered in a handful of scenarios. Some have free energy and their only loss is for the mining hardware. What they make from mining they hope will cover the cost of their hardware and will hope one day to prosper in the bitcoin mining currency. Others lose money for the cost of electricity. One person I know actually managed to write off 3 S7\'s as "business expenses" from his job. Lucky SoB. It depends on the person and why each person got into mining.\n\nFor myself, I\'ve invested in mining hardware just to make a profit, but later down the road decided to also do it in pursuit of helping the Bitcoin network. Sure it would\'ve been more profitable to straight up buy Bitcoin itself, but I wanted to make some what of a profit back in the early days of mining and people were exploiting the shit out of mining. At first I wasn\'t seeing returns that I wanted to, but surely after time passed I started making more because the difficulty was increasing and small time miners were logging off, and the rise of bitcoin value. \n\nMining hardware is always changing. Back when the little USB miners came out by Bitmain those were the cats meow. Even if you had at least 40 of those you could easily be making a nice chunk of bitcoin. As time progressed the S1\'s popped up, then S3\'s, and so on. With mining hardware always changing it\'s hard to consider a time for "buying hardware when it\'s profitable." Most of the time you\'ll see people selling miners on eBay because they aren\'t seeing the returns they\'d like. You can never be ahead of the game in terms of buying mining hardware, miners are wetting themselves over the new 16nm and 14nm chips from BitFury because there actually might be a point in time, shortly, where you  can mine bitcoin and not have to worry about mining into a hole for possibly 6 months. But, time will tell when Bitfury releases their new miner in March. I would like to purchase some when they are released, but I probably won\'t get my hands on one until June or July, just to see how well they perform and if they drop in value due to the halvening growing closer. \n\nIn terms of an "economic argument" in the mining  world, it\'s specific to each miner. Miners that invest thousands of dollars into miners are usually the ones running farms in their basement or garage or rented out building hoping for returns. People that only do it as a hobby aren\'t looking for much of a return when they buy a few miners. With the ever changing difficulty and amount of miners going on and offline it is hard to say how much longer mining will be profitable. Sure people will continue to leave their miners up and running, but to determine how many farms will keep their hardware running is unknown. I think that it purely comes down to how much miners have invested in their hardware before they take their rigs offline. In terms of a ontinued profit in the coming months/years just depends on the constant need for upgrading miners themselves. Like I said before, Bitfury has made their 16nm miner that seems EXTREMELY energy efficient, so I can totally see lots of farms upgrading to those in order to save money and make a bigger profit....but it\'ll only be for so long.\n\nTechnology is always being out dated. Technology is like dog years. 1 year USB miners are the norm, and a 2 years later everyone is pissing themselves in joy when they learn about 16nm processors. It\'s always changning, which is good, but also bad. With the constant upgrades and easier mining and higher rewards, miners are controlling more and more of bitcoin. I see a lot of people in the /r/Bitcoin subreddit that are extremely pro-core. More often than not those kinds of people are usually trying to make it harder for miners to make more bitcoin. But that\'s a different argument for another day. \n\nMiners have the "power to vote" but it\'s not enough to influence a HF or switch to classic. Sure we can aim our hashing power towards a specific pool, but people also need to think about the rest of the users out there that aren\'t mining. Those that are purely using it for normal tasks, and buying things in the real world. I agree that miners do hae the ability to vote for a change, but I don\'t believe that it should be more meaningful than users. Sure miners support a big part in the network, but what gives them a right to what controls the network, but it also comes back to what will benefit miners the most. If the community chooses wrong and fucks over the miners then users will start to take their miners offline or elsewhere that will be more beneficial. By taking miners off the network it opens up doors for, more than likely, the chinese to control a bigger part of the market because of their massive amount of hashing power. Miners should have the same amount of influence of those that use it daily. \n\nI use Bitcoin a few times a week. Of the Bitcoin I gain from my miners I use to pay for gas, a meal at Jimmy Johns, or something like that. The rest I like to use for trading and have fun with it. I\'ve already broken even with my miners, and I\'m making a nice amount of coin from trading for fun, why not have fun mining and trading. This is what, in my opinion, makes Bitcoin so great! There are so many possible outlets for things you can do with it, things that you can do for it, and the things you can do for the network/users. I don\'t see Bitcoin going anywhere any time soon, or if ever. I don\'t know how many people there are out there that are as passionate as me when it comes to Bitcoin. But I believe that Bitcoin has one of the brightest futures ahead of it, and hopefully that it continues to revolutionize global currencies!\n\ntl;dr, It depends on the miner on what THEY consider "a loss." Some mine for money, some mine to help, some do it for shits and gigs, people stop when THEY think it\'s best, unless wanting to support. Buying bitcoin is profitable, but mining gives you the opporunity to make an even bigger profit depending on your investment. Mining hardware is always changing, same with mining difficulty, there isn\'t really a "ahead of the game" situation with hardware. Miners shouldn\'t have a bigger effect on voting than users. Bitcoin is awesome!': 2, 'I remain skeptical that the halving can be truly priced in.

Looking through the charts, it comes down to the following: during the dump from 500-300, China dumped further on the outset than the West causing a lower start to the triangle. Following this, after the move back up to 465 and subsequent crash to 352, here is an example where the *West* dumped further than China. Essentially China has a lower starting point to the triangle but a higher mid-point, causing a steeper angle on the bottom support of the triangle (or you could think of this inversely - the west's line is shallower). I feel the markets are kind of divided over which is more important, if only because I was expecting some *massive* dumping if the triangle broke down. There's no way to draw the triangle on OKC or Huobi without it being breached. However on all western exchanges the triangle is still in play. My ears are up for my long.

I'm not trying to tell you how to trade or that you're wrong or anything like that.  \n\nI love bitcoin.  I think that the idea behind it is incredible and that its potential applications will never go away.  However, I also feel that if bitcoin demonstrates signs of starting a bear trend, it is a very bad thing to hold.  \n\nBeing a long-term holder is a great idea; it helps you ignore the crazy price swings, pump and dumps, and technical drama that comes and goes periodically.  However, this current bull trend has been going on for close to a year.  The downtrend off the original pop took almost 1.5 to end.  \n\nI think that there's a very good chance bitcoin will continue upwards here.  I also think that if it were to crash, there's a very good chance for it to recover.\n\n*However, if it does go down, it's going to go down significantly.*  Think of these triangle patterns on charts as massive springs.  The longer they bounce back and forth, the tighter it gets, and the larger the resulting price move will be.  Look for yourself on historical charts; the longer the triangle, the larger the price move.  Once it gets moving in one direction, **nobody** is going to want to be on the wrong side of that trend.  Leveraged positions, like those on OKCoin, are going to get liquidated.  When that happens, the trend just gets stronger causing other positions to liquidate, stops to be hit, and people to panic sell harder.  \n\nI can't stress enough that I'm neither a bitcoin bull or bitcoin bear; I trade bitcoin to make money.  Long-term holding is a good strategy and it works because there's a better chance of bitcoin going to $1000 in 10 years than $0.  However, if every signal on the market is showing red flags and it looks like they may remain bad for 6+ months, it's probably a good idea to sell as well and buy back cheaper.  \n\nTL;DR I don't know where the market's going to go.  However, I think the chances are **very** good that the next move is going to be a big one.

I came to it of my own volition just by thinking through the economics of the ecosystem and how the crypto economy works.

The problem is Bitcoin is not in a vacuum, it exists with 1000+ other cryptos and alts.

The only reason bitcoin as a settlement layer exists as a proposal is because users have given it that value (utility for payment) via network effects. Without these network effects Bitcoin is just "crypto #1" and can be replaced easily by crypto #2. As users leave the value proposition falls and bitcoin acts neither a currency nor a settlement layer. This is why alts are rising as btc is falling, it\'s not an attack on bitcoin by shadowy forces, it\'s financially invested actors acting rationally.

Sold everything today.': 4, 'This is more of an general education point.\n\nBitcoin is considered by some to be a Giffin Good.  A Giffin Good is a product (an inferior product in some examples) that rises in popularity as the price goes up. \n\nIt is a little different from the true supply and demand economics in a key way:  The supply doesn\'t matter.  \n\nLet me use gold as an example:  As the price of Gold goes up, generally the demand goes up.    The supply of gold above group hasn\'t change remarkably in a long time.  It is a very scarce product in and of itself.  Therefore, supply is simply the willingness of people to part with it.  As the price goes up, people are willing and in some cases, crazy about owning it.  That is what causes "irrational" gold bubbles.\n\nBitcoin too has a limited supply.  While we are still mining them, that mining is controlled so as to be scarce.  If people see value in holding onto their bitcoin (not transactional) of course the price goes up.  \n\nThe question is whether or not it could be considered an inferior replacement for another store of value, or as money.  Right now, I would much rather use my fiat to buy coffee instead of using bitcoin.  Its just what I have always done.\n\nHowever, as a store of value is it easier to get an alternative?  Or is the ability to transfer the value to someone else easier than the alternative?\n\nIt is certainly easier than a wire transfer.  I can do it in seconds.\nIt is easier than the US mail or Fedex.\nIt is easier than gold or silver.\n\nIf I am trying to transfer my money out of the country?  Bitcoin is superb, but is still looked upon as an inferior product because of the ignorance.\n\nI suggest that as currencies start to fall (Brazil and Venezuela as examples) the ease with which you can maintain value with bitcoin will become a much better known store of value.\n\nHow many days until we see vendors in Brazil accepting BTC (unless it is banned by the government.)  \n\nSo, while you gaze at your navels about miners and hard forks (I am being cheeky when I write that) you might want to consider what happens "next."

(Nevermind that in practice "consensus" when it comes to bitcoin really only means consensus by miners.)\n\nMoney can\'t be apolitical because almost every decision will affect different groups of people differently; every change has its winners and losers so it comes down to a policy (i.e. political) choice.

Hell, the problem with trading *bitcoin* (at least in the US) is liquidity. Good luck opening or closing a position larger than $20k without significantly moving the market. I realize this is an issue for the larger traders and not necessarily everyone, but even a year ago when I traded LTC/BTC with $15k I had to be careful as shit getting in and out so as to not move the market. It was 100% necessary to sell into a rally, because if you tried to dump after buy pressure subsided and it was trading sideways you could get some huge slippage (like, trigger a crash and cascading fall type of slippage).\n\nI do tend to agree that bitcoin is pretty boring these days. If it moved $40 in a day, everyone would be freaking out. That's 10%. Go do a scan for the number of stocks that moved +/- 10% today and you'll find tons. None of which are dying, none of which are going to the moon... but if bitcoin did a $40 move in a day *my god* the heads that would roll... really makes me wonder why or how it's actually so stable. Something to do with information symmetry? Stocks typically move on news which is pretty well understood at the onset. Bitcoin news takes time to digest and unfold, making me think it just takes longer for things to take place. We've all seen stocks shoot up 20% after earnings. Bitcoin never does this because it never closes and doesn't have news events, so the information flow is steady and no one really has a jump in disseminating it. At least, that would be my take...": 6, 'Point and Figure Chart of the Day\n\nToday is another one of \xe2\x80\x9cthose\xe2\x80\x9d days, where what is happening in front of me is not what is showing up on the chart.\n\nWhen I look at the candlesticks for the day, we did not hit a new low box so I look at the high for the day and it hit a new high at $422.  That triggers a reversal to a column of Xs as long as we do not reverse down to under $405.  That is why the chart\xe2\x80\x99s last column is shaded\xe2\x80\x94it is a pending reversal that will not become \xe2\x80\x9cofficial\xe2\x80\x9d until 7PM tonight.\n\nIf it reverses to a column of Xs here are the new target numbers:\n\nIt would reverse to a column of Os if we dip to under $405.

(Sounds like a horoscope doesn\xe2\x80\x99t it.)\n\nWe would have a positive break out at prices above $445.  That is pretty far away this morning.  \n\nThe trend reversal would come up $10 to $395.  That is getting closer every time we reverse into a new column.  I think it shows how weak this \xe2\x80\x9crally\xe2\x80\x9d is right now.  But positive is positive.  \n\nThe formation is five columns wide.  It is starting to look like a descending pennant.  My guess is that we are going probably hit the $430 range and fall back down into the teens again.  This has been the pattern over the last few break outs.  We have a pattern forming of lower lows and lower highs.\n\nIf you look at the one day MACD you will see that the sell signal triggered two days ago.  That has been another useful tool to track trend and direction.  Since last summer that has indicated a trend change that lasted a month or so.

My post was at 9 points a few hours ago and now down to 0 (and still going down...). "Somebody" must have created a bunch of accounts to down vote it.\n\nHere\'s the deal: the fees are a rip-off. Their answer is "well it\'s 0.075% on the notional value" and that\'s how everybody does it. I don\'t disagree. But charging 0.075% at 100x leverage is just unheard of.\n\nExample: I put up 1 BTC margin to open a 100BTC trade. If I open and close at market price, **I am charged 15% (0.075% * 100 * 2) on my margin**. Meaning I am down to 0.85BTC before even starting to count my P&L for the trade.\n\n^ This is what I\'m afraid retail traders on your platform are unaware of. These fees are absolutely excessive and you should lower them considerably, or make this fact absolutely clear on your page, which it is not.\n\nNot everyone may use 100x leverage and enter at market, but obviously many people do because that\'s how the price moves on your exchange.\n\nNow I say all this not to be mean, but having worked in compliance for a while I have seen these kinds of rip-off fees in a lot of would-be brokers. They are designed to take advantage of the retail trader, while market makers will use passive orders and less leverage. If this were a regulated business they\'d be in big trouble.\n\n---\n\n**Original answer**:\n\nThose are pretty darn steep. Did not know they charged such high fees. Do people actually trade there?\n\nProbably not everyone uses 100x leverage though.\n\nFor comparison, my Forex broker charges < 0.005% on 100x which is about 10 times less.\n\nEdit:\n\nI did further research and what you posted is indeed correct. \n\nIt\'s quite horrendous what they\'re doing. They\'re taking advantage of the retail traders who trade at 100x and enter at market, charging them **7.5% in fees on every execution = 15% fee to open and close a position**. This is humongous. This fact is not clear at all on their webpage. \n\nHad they been regulated they wouldn\'t be able to charge nearly as much and would have to disclose their fees much more clearly. They are clearly taking advantage of retail traders who start trading without researching their fees properly.

Very few BitMEX traders use the maximum 100x leverage.\n* The settlement fee is no different than closing an open position before the contract settles.\n* We pay traders 0.025% to provide liquidity, which means you can place passive limit orders on BitMEX and get paid to trade with us.\n': 8, "I am a longtime trader on BitMEX and have tried many different exchanges.
