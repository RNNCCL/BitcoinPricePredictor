Do you have any guesses on the lowest possible value when this parabolic spike corrects itself? I'm thinking 138-140 based on the bid orders placed. http://bitcoin.clarkmoody.com/\n": 1, 'Gah, still no window to buy in :/': 2, 'Oh, where to start?\n\nToday we had a little [milestone](http://i.imgur.com/nuIrr19.jpg). For the first time since sliding down the crash, we broke $140. On /r/bitcoin there were no celebratory posts, no "$500 by june!" insanity. It was almost impossible to know that we had just risen above every price level since the crash, and stayed there for hours. This makes me happy. Because the good people of /r/bitcoin are a barometer for the attitude of the new people coming into the market. 2 weeks ago, the front page of it would be littered with memes and fanfare and outlandish, circle-jerky pronouncements of the glory of BTC as it shattered a new all time high.\n\nIrrational Exuberance, Alan Greenspan called it (A man who was not just good at identifying bubbles after they popped, he was good at helping make them, but that\'s an opinion for another subreddit).\nWhen everyone around you seems to be greedy, then it is time to be fearful. Nobody seems greedy. Not yet. \n\nThe rate of increase lately may look a bit worrying, but we have to zoom out a bit. I\'m not worried about rising 228% in the past 7 days, because 7 days ago I believe we were just beginning to climb out of capitulation, and the shockwaves of the crash were still distorting our view. If the crash hadn\'t happened, then yes, 32.5% average daily returns would be insane.\n\nWhat I\'m happy about is rising 100% in 30 days. 30 days ago, we were at $70. 3.33% daily return sounds a lot less exciting, but it\'s also a lot more stable. Someone could make the argument that if you zoom out more, to 6 months, our near 1500% increase is completely irrational, but I don\'t believe it for a simple reason. \n\n3 years ago, bitcoin was the equivalent of Jeff Bezos selling books online in 1994. A fair number of people used it, but nobody knew how much of its potential would be realized. Jeff IPOed in 1997 at $16 a share, for 3 million shares. This valued his company at 48 million dollars. In 6 months, a share of his young, still growing company was almost $50. Holy shit, some people said, 312.5% in 6 months? This is a bubble, this is insane. \n\nThey were right, but Jeff\'s company had resources, as every public company does, to combat irrational inflation of its shares. In June \'98 (It had continued to climb, now at $100 a share), Jeff\'s company split their stock 2:1. In one night, the price of a share was manually cut in half, to $50. In 6 months, that **halved** share was worth $312.  Jeff\'s company enacted an even more aggressive 3:1 split, turning each share into 3 shares. 6 months later they did a third 2:1 split, meaning every share you see today is a twelfth of an original share, which would have cost you $1.50 on the day Amazon.com went public. It trades for more than $250 today.\n\nBitcoin doesn\'t have the luxury of releasing more shares of stock or splitting. When not many people know about it, like 6 months ago, it\'s not that big of a deal. But as people start to take notice, business accept it as payment, and the US government issues guidance acknowledging its existence as a currency? It has no way to vent buying pressure like Amazon.com did, it can only shoot up. Yes, there will be crashes along the way. Yes, I imagine the next one will hurt just like this one did. No, I don\'t think the next one will break $100. I don\'t even think it\'ll break $150. \n\nIn 2011 bitcoin had a bubble that dwarfs this one in percentage. In early 2011, you could buy a btc for 30 cents. At its peak in June, 6 months later, it hit $33. It crashed over the course of a few months, catastrophically, with people pulling their hair out and wailing, all the way down to **$2.51**. What if the crash never happened? [In 10 months, bitcoin went from $.30 to $2.50.](http://i.imgur.com/bQTYESy.jpg) 743%. And it never got lower than that. Never has.\n\nThese bubbles hurt when they pop, but the underlying movement remains as bullish as you can get, because you have to look beyond that garage full of books, and see the *future.*\n\nI didn\'t mean to sound so non-technical, but I truly believe that this past bubble will one day, just like the 2011 bubble, look like a little stepping stone on the way to being something that makes $250/btc look like pocket change.\n\nOk, I promise, next time I\'ll go back to my shiny cold hard charts and hourly trends. Thanks for reading.': 9, 'Thank you for all your analysis/contributions to this sub.\n\nI\'m wanting to get your opinion on when the next bubble will strike. It\'s definitely too early to say, but I think it will either be around $500, or $1000.\n\nSee... the way I figure is there\'s still too much naysaying around BTC from the last crash at 266, and I feel that happened early because of the DDOS. We could have easily hit 300-350 before the crash would have "naturally" happened.\n\nGiven that, I think we\'ll see very progressive, moderate growth up to $300. After that, you\'ll start to hear the media piping in about how BTC has recovered and grown, despite the crash of April \'13! (Hopefully the quality of this journalism will have improved by then, but that may be wishful thinking ;D).\n\nNew blood will be curious and start buying again, and the value will continue to grow (simply because of shrinking supply and growing demand), and this will push it past $400. After which, big money becomes interested again, and we repeat the bubble. \n\nOr not... Maybe the markets wisen up, and we keep going. 600. 750. 850. And finally... 1000, when people start cashing out (because 1000 is one of those numbers that sticks in the brain). At which point the bubble pops. I\'m not going to speculate on how low it will go, as that will largely be a function of what you can use BTC for in the marketplace.\n\nAt least, I think this is what we\'ll see. Pure, pure speculation on my point. Thoughts?': 4, "I think you're dead on with the DDOS triggering an early crash.

That said, I think there are a few things going on right now.\n\nFirst, I just don't think there is much money going into bitcoin right now.  From the last length of the Gox queue and their rate of processing Friday would be the day the queue went empty.  But they also doubled their verification staff, so it could be we are seeing what happens when the new money into the market starts to get exhausted.\n\nSecond, the new lines of asics are starting to ship, including BFL.  This could mean a few things.  It could mean that large mining groups like ASICMiner who probably have a large store of BTC have been trying to sell them off slowly without disturbing the price, but now are dumping large amounts as they see market support waning.  Additionally, people who bought into the new lines and start mining will likely sell off so that they can pay back their original investment.  The miners are in it for the money, and they have bills to pay so they can't just sit around and horde them.\n\nThird, there is a lot of fear about buying in, and the mindset of why buy in at x when I can buy in at (3/4)x in a week or (1/2)x in a month as the market turns down seems to be hampering any rally.  I can't say I blame people either.  I bought big at $90 and held to $152 where I sold, didn't like how things looked and stayed cashed out.  Why would I buy into something that I expect to depreciate quickly over the next few weeks, when I can wait and buy more.\n\nAnd lastly, no one cares about bitcoin (or at least very few).  The bitcoin ATM, even if it was successful wouldn't have done much, because all the people chomping at the bit to put in serious money already did, and the ATM crowd would have only put in a small amount to test the waters.\n\nAnd I don't think any of this is bad.

I would much rather have a stable growth chart that corresponded to increased adoption than a double exponential growth, because we all know what happens there.": 7, "With the BTC ATM release today you'd think the market would be stable or at least on a very modest upward trend, however it's been going down pretty significantly which is not a good sign for a Thursday.\n\nThe market usually starts dropping around Thursday and then continues to remain stagnant until Sunday. This much of a drop though leads me to believe we could see sub $100 by the end of the day and for sure by Monday.\n\nWill this BTC ATM affect prices at all? It does not look like it, usually with the announcement (like Apple is holding a new press conference Iphone 5 expected) the price actually goes up before the conference regardless of the features being unveiled.

You pay the funds to the escrow, and the escrow waits for a confirmation from Freidcat himself that the shares are ready to transfer, and once he gets that confirmation, he releases your funds to the seller. Most escrow services including John charge 1.5% for their services. Trust me though, paying 1.5% is much much better than having to worry if you'll be scammed or not. Especially if you're buying thousands of dollars worth of stock.\n\nAs for me, luckily I was not scammed, and the seller came through.

Take advantage of the volatility instead of loathing it.\n- Never give in and sell for a loss unless you are absolutely sure the price may go down further. NEVER TAKE A LOSS.\n- Never buy in if the price goes parabolic but instead place a bid order and WAIT!\n- Patience and self-discipline are very important.
