For example if fees are 0.6% like MtGox without discounts and there is a trade for 1 btc @ $1000 then there is a $6 fee taken from the buyer of the coin. And a 0.006 btc fee taken from the seller of the coin. This is how most exchanges work like Bitstamp. \n\nOthers have a maker-taker model meaning that there are different fees charged for limit orders "making liquidity" and market orders "taking liquidity". Often times the maker will actually not pay a fee but actually get a small rebate from the takers fee.  For example. The taker may pay a 0.75% fee, but the maker may actually receive a 0.25% rebate when the order is filled, leaving the exchange with 0.5% fees from the trade.  CoinMKT is an example of a maker-taker exchange. The idea is that by giving market makers few rebates you can incentivize traders to create additional liquidity.

[Here is a pretty good overview of their history in relation to their ticker price](http://coinbits.com/2013/11/17/want-to-help-develop-bitcoins-infrastructure-neo-bee-the-first-bitcoin-bank-and-payment-processing-network-is-kicking-it-into-high-gear/)\n\nNeo & Bee did great during their first branch opening, and then have plans for expansion into European territories. I have a lot of confidence in their management and capabilities, as shown by their successful launch of their first launch. Definitely read through their prospectus if you haven\'t already. And a lot of the stocks on Havelock you get some smaller updates but don\'t get to really see how well they are doing like we have with Neo & Bee this past week; they are on top of their game.\n\nI can\'t say if their current market price is too high or low, but if you are holding for the long term I\'d be willing to say in the next 1-2 years NEOBEE will still be around selling for much more if things continue to go well.\n\nAnd for transparency, I hold NEOBEE, SFI and CBTC. I don\'t plan on selling Neo & Bee for a long time. I imagine they may drop down a little bit more, but over the long term I see only good things for them.': 5, "Thanks very much for your insightful commentary. Of course I've read their prospectus, it's a fantastic read, truly.\n\nSo another quick question for you then...\nIf Bitcoin rises in value, wouldn't the money they earn in fees equate to less bitcoin earned, which would equate to lower dividends?\nI'm just trying to be fully understanding here, for the future.\n": 1, "Wow thanks for the gold!\n\nAre you talking about the fees Neo charges their customers? Their fees are all based on percentages of the transaction value, so if BTC rises it won't affect their revenue. 1% of a 100 EUR transaction will always be 1 EUR. Also their  POS rentals make up the majority of their income (if all goes as planned), so the volatility in Bitcoin shouldn't have much of an effect on those fees either.\n\nIf BTC rises in value, their Euro-pegged accounts (which they are planning to be very popular) will be profitable as well, regardless of any associated fees.  Since Neo is taking the risk on decreases but profiting on price increases, all they need is another bubble this year and they'll make out quite well. They would be at a higher risk if they had a large influx of customer accounts when the price was high, and it subsequently crashed thereafter. But considering that they just opened right as the Mt. Gox debacle happened, the biggest drop has (hopefully) already happened.": 2, 'I see, super bullish now.

Having evolved from the concept of trading bands, Bollinger Bands and the related indicators\xc2\xa0%b and bandwidth can be used to measure the "highness" or "lowness" of the price relative to previous trades. Bollinger Bands are a [volatility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volatility_(finance\\)) indicator similar to the [Keltner channel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keltner_channel).\n\n>Bollinger Bands consist of:\n\n>\n\n\n>* an N-period [moving average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average_(finance\\)) (MA)\n\n>* an upper band at K times an N-period [standard deviation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) above the moving average (MA\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0K\xcf\x83)\n\n>* a lower band at K times an N-period [standard deviation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) below the moving average (MA\xc2\xa0\xe2\x88\x92\xc2\xa0K\xcf\x83)\n\n>Typical values for N and K are 20 and 2, respectively. The default choice for the average is a simple [moving average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average), but other types of averages can be employed as needed. Exponential moving averages are a common second choice.  Usually the same period is used for both the middle band and the calculation of standard deviation. \n\n\n\n>====\n\n>[**Image**](http://i.imgur.com/oD05b4w.png) [^(i)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BollingerBandsSPX.svg) - *S&P 500 with 20-day, two-standard-deviation Bollinger Bands,\xc2\xa0%b and bandwidth.*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^John ^Bollinger](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bollinger) ^| [^Technical ^analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis) ^| [^Standard ^deviation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation) ^| [^MetaStock](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MetaStock) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cfptok4) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cfptok4)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/) ^| [^flag ^a ^glitch](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/autowikibot&subject=Glitched comment report&message=What seems wrong: (optional description goes here\\)%0A%0A---%0A%0AReply no. 72684:%0Ahttp://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/1z23ru/this_has_to_mean_something_right/cfptofi)': 3, 'Pretty much...

Trades are happening constantly, so the spreadsheet is changing and updating moment by moment.

I\'m no accountant, but I\'d wager it\'s pretty tricky. Supposing the parent post is true (Awesome post by the way!), a while back someone went to balance the vault and the spreadsheet and said "oh shit."

(Positive form) \n\n>* One should not treat others in ways that one would not like to be treated (Negative form, also known as the [Silver Rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Rule)) [citation needed].\n\n>This concept describes a "reciprocal", or "two-way", relationship between one\'s self and others that involves both sides [equally](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egalitarianism), and in a mutual fashion.  \n\n>This concept can be explained from the perspective of psychology, philosophy, sociology and religion. Psychologically, it involves a person [empathizing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy) with others. Philosophically, it involves a person perceiving their neighbor as also "an I" or "self."   Sociologically, this principle is applicable between individuals, between groups, and also between individuals and groups. (For example, a person living by this rule treats all people with consideration, not just members of his or her [in-group](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group)). Religion is an integral part of the history of this concept.  \n\n>As a concept, the Golden Rule has a history that long predates the [term](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminology) "Golden Rule", or "Golden law", as it was called from the 1670s.   As a concept of "the ethic of reciprocity," it has its roots in a wide range of world cultures, and is a standard way that different cultures use to resolve conflicts.   It has a long history, and a great number of prominent religious figures and philosophers have restated its reciprocal, "two-way" nature in various ways (not limited to the above forms). \n\n>[Rushworth Kidder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rushworth_Kidder) notes that the Golden Rule can be found in the early contributions of [Confucianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Golden_Rule#Confucianism) (551\xe2\x80\x93479 BC). Kidder notes that this concept\'s framework appears prominently in many religions, including "[Hinduism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism), [Buddhism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism), [Taoism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taoism), [Zoroastrianism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoroastrianism), and the rest of the world\'s major religions".  According to [Greg M. Epstein](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_M._Epstein), "\xe2\x80\x89\'do unto others\'\xc2\xa0... is a concept that essentially no religion misses entirely."  [Simon Blackburn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Blackburn) also states that the Golden Rule can be "found in some form in almost every ethical tradition".  All versions and forms of the proverbial Golden Rule have one aspect in common: they all demand that people treat others in a manner in which they themselves would like to be treated.\n\n\n>====\n\n>[**Image from article**](http://i.imgur.com/WVSmnoB.jpg) [^(i)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bernard_d%27Agesci_La_Justice.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^That ^Golden ^Rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Golden_Rule) ^| [^Golden ^rule ^\\(law)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_rule_\\(law\\)) ^| [^Golden ^Rule ^\\(album)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule_\\(album\\)) ^| [^Golden ^Rule ^\\(fiscal ^policy)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule_\\(fiscal_policy\\)) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cfsb9k4) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cfsb9k4)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)': -1, "It depends - will you be posting with the aim of stimulating healthy discourse among the members of this subreddit, or will you be posting teasers with sensationalist headlines intended to promote your blog & email list?\n\nI have enjoyed your contributions in the past, but as someone who has themselves (in the past) had to play the game of building a public profile, your recent antics in /r/bitcoin reeked to high heaven for me.

HMRC went a step further, saying it would not charge the tax on their margins either.\n\nThe ruling sidesteps the thorny question of whether to class Bitcoin as a currency, but effectively treats it as such, and bases its policy on the EU law that exempts payments and transfers of \xe2\x80\x9cnegotiable instruments\xe2\x80\x9d from tax.\n\nGovernments worldwide have wrestled with the conundrum of how to deal with virtual currencies, as businesses hoping to profit from a small but growing economy have lobbied for regulation that would allow them to flourish.\n\nSingapore has issued tax guidelines for Bitcoin, while an internal US watchdog has criticised the Internal Revenue Service for not doing so.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf they had added VAT that would have destroyed us, there would have been no point in starting this business at all,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jonathan Harrison, who has a start-up working on bringing Bitcoin ATM machines to the UK. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s great that the UK authorities are seeing Bitcoin as an innovative technology that can help the economy.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe European Banking Authority has warned that consumers are not protected by any refund rights under EU law when using virtual currencies for commercial transactions. China has banned its banks from handling Bitcoin, while Russia and Vietnam have declared transactions illegal.\n\nThe decision comes as the Bitcoin Foundation, the non-profit advocacy group, told the Financial Times it would redomicile to the UK this spring from the US. Some Bitcoin users see the UK as a more favourable jurisdiction in the wake of Edward Snowden\xe2\x80\x99s revelations about the US government spying on the internet as well as centre of a buoyant \xe2\x80\x9cfin-tech\xe2\x80\x9d industry.\n\nThe Bitcoin Foundation, set up to develop the software that runs the currency and to lobby governments and regulators, is searching for staff and office space in London, according to board executive director Jon Matonis.\n\nLast year HMRC had classed Bitcoin as a voucher, charging VAT on the value of the coin itself. Businesses in the UK had protested against that treatment, saying it would drive customers abroad to countries where no charge was levied. HMRC later withdrew that guidance after meetings over the course of last year.\n\nOther taxes, such as corporation tax, would still apply. The policy applies to all business that buy, sell or exchange Bitcoin.\n\nThe total value of all Bitcoins in circulation is $6.9bn, up from $150m a year ago, according to BlockChain.info. The price of Bitcoin stood at $555 on Sunday, according to the BTC-E exchange, down from a peak of $1,242 in December.\n\nThe tax authority said: \xe2\x80\x9cHMRC has been working closely with the Bitcoin industry on the tax treatment of trading in Bitcoins and commission.

Basically what happened is the \'attacker\' created a huge amount of tiny transactions that they knew would be executed regularly by the trading engine (since they were around market price).\n\nEach time a trade completed, the attackers balance would be updated (i.e. they started with 100 BTC, they just sold 0.1, they now have 99.9 BTC).\n\nNow, the race condition occurs when the attacker also withdraws at the same time a trade is being executed. The withdraw system checks the balance - cool, 99.9 BTC. At the same time, a trade begins to execute - no problem, balance is 99.9 BTC.\n\nThe withdrawl finishes, and the balance is set to 0 BTC (assuming all withdrawn). In the meantime, the next 0.1 BTC trade completes - when it started, the balance was 99.9. So it adjusts the balance back to 99.8, since it is going off old data - and thus the attacker has just "stolen" ~100 BTC, since the money is both in their wallet (or soon to be), and also on that exchange still.\n\nHope that clarifies it :-)': 2, 'The beginning of the end for bitcoin.

Loans at higher rates tend not to last long, i.e. they get closed out early - I get the impression traders take a high rate when there\'s nothing else available, but will then pay the loan back ASAP.  Realistic rates currently seem to be hovering under 0.1% per day minus the 10% fee.  During the recent MtGox excitement there were rates as high as 0.5 - 0.6% but loans at those rates didn\'t last long.\n4.

I can\'t yet say what the price will do in a week or a month, but my sentiment is overall bearish, and has been since December 4th when I created an account with Bitfinex specifically to short BTC.\n\nAlthough, I have found myself going long occasionally, when the margin interest (AKA swap) was not too high. Currently, I am short from 578 with a stop at 645.\n\nOverall, I have made a 400%+ return on my principal investment trading in (mostly shorting) bitcoin. My most important piece of advice to you, if you want it, is to avoid reading (or believing) much of what you read here. Although some people are spot-on, and even those who are not extremely sharp sometimes contribute useful insights, many of the posts here contain significant and glaring fallacies that would not have propagated but for an absence of understanding of fundamental economics.\n\nWithout this understanding, you start believing in and repeating fantastical notions of "whales," "sell walls" and "buy walls," and "flash crashes." The last of these, by the way, is a real thing, but didn\'t happen with bitcoin. The drop on the BTC-e exchange to ~$100 was due to a large market order on a thinly written buy limit order book, which is a different cause than the flash crashes you read about happening to the U.S. equities exchanges.\n\nYour point about the potential for either abandonment of bitcoin or decreased adoption is entirely valid. Not only will people be less likely to invest in something that is prone to theft, they will also be less likely to invest in something that has a substantial recent price decline. In the first case, we have seen the Silk Road thefts and now this theft from Mt.Gox. In the second, we have seen a drop from 1242 to 131 (or 0, probably) on Mt. Gox, and from ~1180 to 555 on Bitstamp. Finally, governments are becoming more involved with bitcoin after the SR and Gox debacles, which will start to deter bitcoin idealists. Many of the buy-and-hold, cold storage types like bitcoin because of its decentralized nature, which may quickly erode.\n\nWhile it is true that bitcoin adoption rates (commercial use) has slowly increased, its pace of 20% per year is far surpassed by bitcoin\'s price appreciation. A long-standing criticism by bears and bitcoin skeptics is essentially, "why would anyone convert to a currency that can drop 50% in a month?" Or, "if they did, and it instead rose 50% in a month, why would they spend it?" Therefore, bitcoin as a currency is greatly compromised by its price volatility. Large currency price fluctuations (think Central America and the Weimar Republic) are economically unstable, and currencies with volatility will not be *voluntarily adopted* for this reason.\n\nSo, in short, you are not alone. I think you have a real capacity for understanding bitcoin, and from what you posted here, I believe you have a reasonably good shot at profiting from trading it. One thing people say here a lot that I do agree with: "don\'t invest more than you can afford to lose." Good luck, and welcome to the world of bitcoin!': 32, 'Am I arguing that there aren\'t large orders? No. You\'re completely right to say that just as one person might trade 0.1 BTC, and another 1 BTC, another might trade 1000 BTC.\n\nHowever, not all of the large-order trades are from individuals. If you have a Bitfinex account and watch the order book, you often see orders with the exact same denomination placed on Bitstamp, usually priced a dollar away from the Bitfinex limit order. You can see these orders aggregate at "hot" price points like $600 or $550, and you can watch as orders are added to those key points on Bitfinex, often totaling hundreds or low thousands. Then you see a single order placed on the Bitstamp exchange as 345.31 or 1,060.12. This idea defies the concept of a "whale." Isn\'t it possible that other large purchases and sales are similarly aggregates of many tens or hundreds of smaller orders? So, for one, there aren\'t that many whales. Further, most people with a significant amount of money (millions or billions to invest) aren\'t interested in bitcoin because it is 1) too speculative, and 2) too illiquid, and 3) too small (tiny market capitalization).\n\nThat second point comes to bear when you think about sell walls or buy walls. On many of the exchanges, a $500,000 market order for bitcoin will wipe out the order books by several hundred bitcoin, like with what happened to BTC-e the other week. The fact that these large limit orders are converting to market orders is, by the way, evidence against the idea of a sell wall or buy wall.\n\nBut let\'s say you are a sinister rich person, and you want to manipulate the bitcoin market with a "sell wall." That is, you want to post a huge order with the intent of driving the price down. Presumably, you already have a short position. Let\'s use today\'s numbers to illustrate an example. Let\'s say you have a short position at $500, and you want the price to go down to $500 or lower so you can profit from my short. Let\'s say you have the funds to post a margin sell limit order of 2000 btc at the current price of 568.55 USD:BTC. So you post it.\n\nImmediately, you have some problems. First, exchanges (including Bitfinex) offer the option to hide orders above 100 BTC. So there may be a countering 2000 BTC buy limit order above your sell limit price. In that case, your order is immediately filled, and you have only succeeded in dollar cost averaging (or double downing) your position. Second, smaller orders can nibble at your position. I have seen it happen, and I have watched positions over 1000 BTC slowly erode as they get filled by market buy orders. What is to prevent that from happening when you put up a sell wall? And if it happens, you are in a worse position than when you started, because traders see the higher volume from the eating of your order, and respond by market buying and driving the price higher.\n\nBut let\'s say you succeed, and people "panic sell" when they see your "sell wall." Okay, now you\'ve driven the market price down to $450, but in so doing, you just obliterated the limit buy order book by driving people to place market sell orders. So who is going to sell your bitcoin back to allow you to close your position? Especially, who is going to sell with market sell orders after just watching the price go from $568.55 to $450? The only way to close the position profitably is to place a hidden limit buy order at $450, and hope people will sell to you at $450 or lower. But what if people think to "buy cheap bitcoin" and start placing market buy orders, driving the price up to $500? Then you have to keep adjusting your order to chase after the increasing market price, up to $475, then $500, then $550. At the end of the day, and with a small enough trading volume, you might have to chase it so far and so fast that you end up buying back very close to your original short price.\n\nAlternatively, you might close your position as a market position, but when doing that you might end up wiping out the sell limit order book with an average buy price that is larger than your original sell prices.\n\nManipulating using a "sell wall," therefore, can backfire. Too many variables are at play, and it can be difficult to predict market reactions. You may think of people as mindless minnows, swimming in schools. But if you have ever tried to net small fish, you know how difficult it can be to predict the movement of the group, even as the group moves uniformly.': 6, 'Why buy now?

It could be that Bitfinex rejected the order because you did not already have an open (in this case, long) position.\n\nI HAVE noticed that Bitfinex deletes orders that are improperly entered, or become improperly entered. Recently, for example, when I place a limit on the margin interest, the order sometimes closes. The other day, I was doing this with 0.08% interest. I had an open order to sell short X BTC, and some BTC were available at the 0.08% interest rate, so it partially filled the order for those. Then the only rates available were 0.17% or higher, so it deleted the order.\n\nThe alternative, if it didn\'t delete the order for being "unrealistic," would be that it\'s dropping orders from its books as a result of a technical glitch.

That may manifest as bans, articulation of tax status, and stringent regulations, each of which may drive down the price due to abandonment or decreased adoption.

Amount of capital to use: Divide your capital into 10 equal parts\n   and never risk more than one-tenth of your capital on any one trade.\n\n2. Use stop loss orders. Always protect a trade when you make it with\n   a stop loss order 3 to 5 points away.\n\n3. Never overtrade. This would be violating your capital rule.\n\n4. Never let profit run you into a loss. After you once have a profit\n   of 3 points or more, raise your stop loss order so that you will\n   have no loss in capital.\n\n5. Do not buck the trend. Never buy or sell if you are not sure of the\n   trend acording to your charts.\n\n6. When in doubt, get out, and don\'t get in when in doubt.\n\n7. Trade only active stocks. Keep out of slow, dead ones.\n\n8. Equal distribution of risk. Trade 4 or 5 stocks, if possible. Avoid\n   tying up all your capital in any one stock.\n\n9. Never limit your orders or fix a buying or selling price. Trade at\n   the market.\n\n10. Don\'t close yout trades without good reason. Follow up with a stop\n    loss order to protect your profits.\n\n11. Accumulate a surplus. After you have made a series of successfule\n    trades, put some money into surplus account to be uses only in\n    emergency or in times of panic.\n\n12. Never buy just to get dividend.\n\n13. Never average a loss. This is one oof the worst mistakes a trader\n    can make.\n\n14. Never get out of the market just because you have lost patience or\n    get into the market because you are anxious from waiting.\n\n15. Avoid taking small profits and big losses.\n\n16. Never cancel a stop loss order after you have placed it at the\n    time you make the trade\n\n17. Aviod getting in and out of the market too often.\n\n18. Be just as willing to sell short as you are to buy. Let your\n    object be to keep with the trend and make money.\n\n19. Never buy just because the price of a stock is low or sell short\n    just because the price is high.\n\n20. Be careful about pyramiding at the worng time. Wait until the\n    stock is very active and has crossed Resistance Levels before\n    buying more and until it has broken out of the zone of\n    distribution before selling more.\n\n21. Select the stocks with small volume of share outstanding to\n    pyramid on the buying side and the ones with largest volume of\n    stock outstanding to sell short.\n\n22. Never hedge. If you are long of one stock and starts to go down,\n    do not sell another stock short to hedge it. Get out at the\n    market; take your loss and wait for another opportunity.\n\n23. Never change yout position in the market without a good\n    reason. When you make a trade, let it be for some good reason or\n    according to some definite plan; then do not get out without a\n    definite indication of a change in trend.\n\n24.

Therefore, rather than conclude that they made a bad choice, they convince themselves that the choice was right and that since the stock has declined it is a better deal now than it was originally.  In a state of denial, they buy more of the stock that declined.\n\nIt is far better to average up, because it is behaving the way you anticipated.\n\n\nFor instance my dad was in MTGOX.

There are a number of factors that go into determining jurisdiction, but basically, the more customers and business activity that you have in the U.S., the more likely it is that you are subject to U.S. jurisdiction.  Mt.Gox certainly has enough U.S. activity to be sued in US courts, regardless if they are incorporated in the US or Japan.\n\nThere has also been a lot of confusion in the subs over what *type* of company Mt.Gox actually is.  I've seen people argue that it is a US corporation, a US LLC, and a Japanese K.K. entity.  The fact that Gox is registered in Delaware could mean that it is their state of incorporation in the US (many large companies incorporate in Delaware because of favorable tax laws (more corps than people in DE)), or merely its registration as a foreign corporation.  \n\nCorporate structure isn't always easy to figure out, either.  Companies can frequently change their structure and form spin-off companies, holding companies, umbrella companies, sister companies, subsidiary companies, etc., etc.  And they can do this in multiple countries.  It's the shell game that US corps play to avoid paying taxes.  So, pinning Gox down to a single entity might not be that easy depending on how they've organized.\n\nFortunately, this confusion isn't worth bothering over for the issues we are discussing here.  The structure of a corp or LLC is very flexible and you can do many of the same things whichever way you organize your business to the point that they can be indistinguishable in most respects.

This was quite the bounce from the low of $400.  The formation for the day on the candlestick chart was a long and closed near the open.  This is indicative of a change upward.  Whether or not this is a long term change has yet to be seen.\n\nSo, our targets have changed.  The buy signal is still at $650.  The sell signal is at $399.99.  Now THAT is a stretch.

Swings of those degrees are not how we want to live--unless you have a lot of coins, a lot of cash, and a lot of time.  But what else do we have to do these days?\n\nI believe our support is back around the $530 level.  My guess, and it is an educated guess--but still a guess--is that we wander around these levels ($530-600) for the next couple of days.  Then we figure out where we go from here.\n\nI think the stories of Bitcoin\'s death are being greatly exaggerated.

Bitcoin and other digital currencies can help millions of Americans make payments without being beholden to high credit card fees. It is actually less anonymous than using cash for transactions; cash will always be an easier way to launder money. In addition, Silicon Valley venture capitalists, who I believe have helped fund some of your past campaigns, are pouring money into developing companies and applications which provide a trustworthy infrastructure for digital payment systems built around Bitcoin. There is more Silicon Valley investment Bitcoin companies right now than almost any other segment of technology. By opposing this innovation, you are mistakenly going to cost jobs and tax revenue for millions of law abiding Americans in West Virginia and other states. State regulators in NY and throughout the country are hard at work developing common sense regulations to prevent money-laundering through digital currencies, so this will not be an issue when the new regulations come out.

Support is fasr too.': 1, 'I\'m still a bit of a Ripple noob so you may get better info from someone else ;)  That said, this is how I do it:\n\n1. First, create a [Ripple Wallet] (https://ripple.com/) for yourself.  You\'ll also need a gateway to deposit USD into, [SnapSwap] (https://www.snapswap.us/) should be a good start (it\'s what I use).  Make sure to read the SnapSwap [FAQ] (https://www.snapswap.us/#/faq), e.g. you need to give SnapSwap a "trust" line in your Ripple wallet.  You\'ll also need to get set up on Bitstamp, & also give them a "trust" line so you can send USD via Ripple to their Ripple address later.\n\n2. Once you have the accounts set up, in SnapSwap click "Send to Ripple" & enter in whatever amount of USD you want to deposit.  It\'ll give you a quote w/ the fee included (0.99% + $0.30).  At this point I\'d go to a Bank of America branch & deposit that exact amount of $$ into SnapSwap\'s account.  They do have other deposit options (supposedly they also do ACH maybe??), I have no experience with the other options but you may want to give their [blog] (http://blog.snapswap.us/) a read-through.\n\n3. It might take a few business days for your the first deposit, otherwise usually a cash USD deposit typically shows up in SnapSwap in 1-2 business days.  Once the USD is in there you can send your USD from SnapSwap to Bitstamp\'s Ripple address.  You *will* lose some USD during the transfer into Bitstamp, it\'s usually been maybe $7 or so for me (still *way* cheaper than an international wire transfer!).  The USD shows up in your Bitstamp account in maybe 30-60 mins.\n\nThat\'s pretty much it!
