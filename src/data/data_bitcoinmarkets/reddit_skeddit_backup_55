Gox seems to have much less consolidation of asks on certain price points, which means the entire exchange doesn\'t get "stuck" nearly as much, as there is a more varied spread of small orders that seem to flow back and forth much more easily.\n\nSometimes this results in more volume for Gox, but not always, as the multitude of orders priced near current market are often very small, while the walls on Bitstamp mean that when they are breached, naturally the volume is high. But the "fluidity" of orders getting filled often seems to allow more price movement, whereas the "friction" on Bitstamp seems to result in more difficulty getting past certain points.\n\nRight now, my best theory (because I\'m really rather new to trading in general) is that these continuous jagged swings on Gox (seen here http://imgur.com/a/YLL0d) are the behavior of a bunch of trading bots all jockeying for tiny gains, while the patterns on Bitstamp are more representative of human traders making big bets on larger periods.

But here is my answer*\n\nIts a little complicated. I will try to explain it and you can ask more questions if you have any. The short version of it is that the economic system of a exchange is more stable if there is a similar wealth distribution between the traders and the asset$/cash$ is low. Lets say we have five traders. mr 2009, mr 2010, mr 2011, mr 2012 & mr 2013. They all put in 100 dollars they year they entered the market and they all own 100 dollar in savings. Lets say they price was 0.01$ 2009 and multiplied times 10 every year. To make it simple mr 2009 started with 11111 BTC and sold the other 100$ worth of BTC the year they entered the market. \n\n\ndistribution year 2013\n\n* mr 2009 has 10000BTC\n\n* mr 2010 has 1000BTC\n* mr 2011 has 100BTC\n* mr 2012 has 10BTC\n* mr 2013 has 1BTC\n\n\nLets say that mr 2009 thinks that a good disputation of wealth is 99% in BTC and 1% in cash. The others are more bullish and can stand having 100% in BTC if the price is "low". Is the possible at the current price? Nope people can only buy 5 more BTC between them. Mr 2009 has changed his exposed to bitcoin by a fraction. The exchange now owned 1000$ and mr 2009 cashed out. They exchange has no money and mr 2009 owns all of it. \n\n\nSo to go back to your question. Its a good thing that the early adopters are selling coins. They ar changing the distrubution to something more stable. The problem is the price. If the price goes up fast the wealth distribution becomes very bad when new traders enter the market. The Chinese market does not have this problem in the same way. Most of them entered the market late and the new traders are probably entered with more cash than the first traders.\n\n\nSo If we tried to follow the Chinese price and consider it the true value of a bitcoin. The exchanges could dry up here if early adopters with lots of bitcoins exit some of the cash out of the market. The rally would only would make it worse.\n ': 2, 'thanks!\nIts definitely a different market dependent of the factors you just mentioned.

If so, what are they and how is this time different?', 5): {'I have been following the community here before the April 2013 bubble and ever since then. My take is that bitcoin was such a fledgling technology even compared to now. Much had changed within just 6 months. There was a lot more uncertainty back then about what it\'s potential uses were, how governments would react, and much higher price volatility. Merchants accepting bitcoin were few and far in between and any attention by a recognized figure sent bitcoin supporters giggling like school girls. \n\nSilk Road was definitely the bitcoin economy at the time followed by bitcoinstore (not certain about the name anymore). Gox was the goto exchange even though it\'s servers weren\'t nearly ready for the media hype that was to come. The economy was actually chugging along quite nicely at the time since most people before the April bubble actually spent their bitcoin. It then became the obvious speculation we see now. When the media frenzy and speculation came, daily DDoS attacks on gox were the cause of targeted market manipulation, causing mass panic sells. \n\nPeople forget that the volatility we saw in april during the bubble was mostly caused by DDoS. 20% daily fluctuations up and down. In the later stages of the bubble, people were completely detached from the reality of bitcoin\'s stage of usefulness and it was all about "to da moon".\n\nI don\'t think we are seeing anything like the conditions of uncertainty that caused the last bubble to pop. I don\'t believe we are in bubble territory yet either. Some BIG news has to happen for prices to take a dive at the moment. The current push isn\'t fragile because real foundations are being laid, not simply promises of what could be (rather, to a much lesser extent than in april). People are also wary and are waiting for support to appear at regular intervals. \n\nWe aren\'t testing pullbacks to new lows because we also know that even the worlds biggest economies are actively discussing policy on bitcoin. As soon as the announcement was made that China would not regulate bitcoin (for now) and the whole Baidu thing (more symbolic really), there\'s just no way we\'re seeing some unsupported artificial price right now. \n\n': 3, "Yeah, I think we're going to crash about 15-20% soon, but it'll be just a bear trap that we'll recover from within a week - and much of the way within hours.  We're growing at around 6% a day at the moment, which is too fast.  So we'll keep growing, but at a somewhat slower rate.  \n\nIt could also be difficult to time a sell and a buy so that you make a profit, as you might well sleep through crucial periods and miss the window of opportunity.

Actually, to note, LTC just jumped up to a huge 2.2 from 1.65 right now that I missed out on thanks to me being busy all day on Wednesdays - it will likely correct lower though especially as BTC pressure continues to rise.  This is exactly what I\'m talking about. You can\'t honestly argue that XPM would be a better buy when the proof in buyer interest is happening right now.\n  \nLTC\'s constant downward decline has been largely an effect of a constant steady small loss of faith and doubts about where the real bottom was. This has killed LTC\'s volume over the months especially as news everyone is waiting for has yet to happen. LTC is now officially cheap enough to be interesting, and just look at the volume for LTC trading right now - it is much higher than it has been in recent history. Its because of these factors and the reason why its been on a downward trend so far that I don\'t think its slowly going to die and disappear, since its largely because of news, market factors of other altcoins showing up, and doubts about LTC that have driven it down in the past few months. I\'m not convinced that it will live in its current grave forever.\n  \n  \n1. The other alt coins are literally nothing more than a passing note at this point. LTC, wither you think this is true or not, has always had the perception of being the "king" of alt-coins and all the buy interest on the "altcoin" world as such is clearly focused on LTC. There just isn\'t enough volume, or reason, for anyone to want other alt coins right now. Take a look at r/lightcoin or the trollbox on BTC-e as proof. Almost nobody is talking about anything but LTC. This isn\'t meaningless.  \n  \n2. See above  \n  \n3. Honestly wither or not it gets adopted to specific exchanges is irellevant at this point. I don\'t think BTCchina will adopt LTC any more than I think coinbase will, because LTC simply isn\'t on the market for them as long as it remains obscure enough. Its very likely that nothing will happen with LTC widespread adoption until Gox does what it does, and I have no reason to belive that Gox will somehow fail before then unless the conspiracy theories are true.  \n': 2, "Ditto.

When that was happening I decided it would be best to focus entirely on BTC while this current uptrend for BTC is happening and get back into LTC when I am done.   \n  \nI feel fairly confident at this point that LTC will most certainly see higher than where it is now in the not so distant future (hell it went up to 2.25 just from an announcement of maintence alone on Gox just recently), and in my mind that makes it more valuable than selling into USD at this point.  \n  \n": 4, 'Or maybe he is buying up large quantities of LTC beforehand ; D\n\nWho knows really.

I've noticed some new names posting in the threads this last week, which is great (and welcome!), but woe betide we start seeing a migration of r/bitcoin mindset rearing it's ugly head.  No one putting money in at this point should even for a second underestimate the likelihood of some major selling ahead once we start to edge back to (and possibly beyond) $200.  And if we do indeed break $200, there's going to be a strong psychological sentiment of extreme caution given the previous bubble.  There's going to be some next level volatility should the price move anywhere near $250, and at that point if we don't see some major media attention turning the spotlight on BTC, it's going to be lights out on the parade.  Furthermore, even if we do see BTC garnering new attentions, they too shall mostly pass at some point, and then yet again traders and investors will begin exercising caution by protecting their position.  Any of you here who don't have an air tight plan of action for your holdings already should get one in place right now.
