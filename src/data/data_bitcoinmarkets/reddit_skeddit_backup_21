Do they look into slippage, etc. \n\nMaybe if they think its a bad time to sell, they will wait and take out a small hedge in case they are wrong?

[The Dawn of Trustworthy Computing](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/2014/12/the-dawn-of-trustworthy-computing.html) He uses (coins?) a couple terms in this essay that I think are pretty fundamental to pinpointing the nature and function of Bitcoin. The first is "A block chain computer is a virtual computer, a computer in the cloud." I think block chain computer is a useful concept. It\'s just like a computer, only with it\'s parts distributed over a much larger scale, with multiple human owners. The second is "fiduciary code." Basically code that can be trusted, and because of that, can control assets. I think these two concepts almost encapsulate Bitcoin at a higher level than we usually talk about it at the technological level.\n\nIn the wider context, Nick focuses on the aspects of technology that change the dynamics at play for relationships between humans. They range over several time periods and usually focus on technological development.\n\nAnother great resource is going to be Jordan Greenhall\'s writings on his blog [Emergent Culture and Deep Code](https://medium.com/emergent-culture/the-coming-great-transition-e50d62da77d4). Jordan focuses on how culture changes due to technology, and he treats cultures as organisms. Memes and ideas, religions and movements and wars are programs that we are the substrate for. And these programs evolve against each other in sometimes novel dynamics. The fundamental force behind his optimism is that we can reprogram these cultures and thrive:\n\n>"The abundance model can be well understood as that model that has moved from focusing on \xe2\x80\x9cproductivity\xe2\x80\x9d to focusing on \xe2\x80\x9cinnovation\xe2\x80\x9d: *a well designed abundance model will substantially increase our innovative generativity.

Mining is becoming more consolidated. As competition is killed off, the intensity of competition becomes less fierce. For the winners, fewer resources are now needed to stay in the game. If things don't pay off for the winners, though, then maybe this is only the beginning of a hash rate collapse. A hash rate collapse would bring very bad sentiment to the markets, lowering the price of bitcoin further and creating a negative feedback loop for the miners.\n\nMining centralization/consolidation is an inevitability with bitcoin due to the design of the protocol. The question is, how will it happen, and how long will it take? In a capitalist society with rule of law, this typically happens with buyouts and mergers -- and before you know it -- a multi-national conglomerate like Unilever or Coca-Cola or Proctor & Gamble own dozens or hundreds of brands. But in a completely lawless free market system, you can expect something more Darwinian, where survival of the fittest (and a little luck) determines which mining operations thrive and which go extinct. When you consider the halving schedule, it should be really obvious that mining consolidation will happen fairly quickly, whether or not that was Satoshi's intention.

You end up getting more shares when the price is low by default, not because you guessed the top or bottom and changed your behavior accordingly.  \n  \nValue Averaging is what you call trying to buy more in dollar amounts when you think it is bottoming.  DCA is a concession that you are unlikely to be able to accurately time the market, while Value Averaging, on the other hand, expresses a confidence that you will succeed at timing the market.  \n  \nDCA is particularly good for a highly volatile asset that you expect to do well long term but suspect drastic swings in the short term.  It is a hedge against buying at the top.  \n  \nNot a huge fan of how this guy takes specific examples and assumes they somehow imply anything about the market.  Yeah, pick AIG, a company that essentially imploded in 2008.  It's an outlier.  And you made good trades on one stock.  He's not making a very compelling statistical case.  Anecdotes essentially.\n  \nThere is also often a touch of confusion around exactly what is meant when you say DCA.  Typical analysis assumes that you have a lump sum that you can either invest at once or in increments.  Simply buying the same every week isn't really dollar cost averaging in the traditional sense.  That really isn't DCA, it's Automatic Buying.    \n  \nI think there is certainly a convincing case that if you have a sum to invest, the sooner you do so the better off you are likely to be.  A lot of people here and elsewhere though aren't thinking about large lump sums when they talk about DCA, so it ends up a bit of a misnomer.  They more tend to mean buying in at every paycheck or something.  \n  \nFor me, I want to hold as much bitcoin as I can.  I could take out credit, in an amount that I could afford to lose resulting in a manageable repayment schedule, but I do not.  I consider buying small increments every week at a percentage of my pay to be my preferred strategy.  You could say I DCA in the sense that my available credit is a potential lump sum that I choose not to use.  I am hedging against buying in at the top.\n  \nSo, while this video doesn't give us any statistical insight, the numbers are out there.  [Vanguard did a study](https://pressroom.vanguard.com/content/nonindexed/7.23.2012_Dollar-cost_Averaging.pdf) that got a lot of traditional investors' panties in a bunch.  They looked at historical returns in 3 major global markets over 10 years.  Lump sum purchasing beat DCA 2/3 of the time.  Significant, but not the open and shut case some would have you believe.  1/3 of the time DCA was the better move.  \n  \nThese numbers are market averages, however, and the story changes when you pick a specific asset.  Volatility and variance are the key indicators on whether DCA is a good strategy for a given asset.  Certainly if you had $1,000 and bought a lump sum of Bitcoin a year ago you would have less coins than if you split that into 52 purchases every week this year.\n  \nFinally, just because lump sum buying has been a traditionally better choice, does not mean it will continue to be in the future.  The past does not predict the future, necessarily.": 2, "I've been dollar cost averaging with buys twice a week since last October.

I certainly did not think we would be sliding this far for this long. Nonetheless I'm persevering and riding it as best I can so long as I am able to afford it and bot performance is able to hedge against further market losses.

(even in this model the portfolio is at a net loss)  \n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/hJzxmcE.png\n\nIf you are investing a manageable (small) amount on a regular, un-interrupted basis - dollar cost averaging the market for a length of time such that you buy all the way down and at the bottom and exit at some point above the bottom, has the potential for being a viable and safe entry method.  However, this doesn't go without the martingale concept ringing true, such that if your funds run out, your zero cost price will not change and you can lose your shirt for considerably more than you can afford to lose.\n\nIn the example in the video, had the investor kept investing in AIG at the same rate on a true dollar cost averaging basis between 2006 and today - the average cost would have been reduced enough such that the total portfolio would be up 20% today.

If the market dives and shows some recovery over a period long enoughsuch that my DCA zero profit price can catch up and I am able to maintain the lifestyle and investment commitment I have started - I believe DCA will eventually pay off in my favor.\n\nTL;DR,  I am doing and like DCA.

I've been posting my Bitcoin trading advice to https://twitter.com/wbic32 for the last month or so.\n\nI'm still refining the model, which you can watch on GitHub. https://github.com/wbic16/wbic32\n\nIn essence I watch a smoothed 60-day exponential moving average. I look for critical points where the market has over or under corrected. Because of the window size, I'm quite confident in the local behavior.\n\nIt indicated a buy around $310 in October, before I started posting the advice. It indicated a sell when we broke $400 a few weeks ago.\n\nI'll write up a blog post about it soon, once I've finished the graduated price filler. If you want to follow the advice, you can do it by:\n\n1. Setting a minimum reserve.\n2. Trading x% on sell days and y% on buy days.\n3. Setting x and y for your particular goals.\n\nYou could buy 1 btc and sell 0.5 btc if you are trying to extend your position, for instance.": 3, "I'll admit it. My strategy is basically this. Initially I bought at $150 then divested all but 5% at $500 in 2013. I kicked myself at $1000. I re-entered when it hit $400 this year (April-ish) and I've bought $50-$200 per month since then. I'm currently operating at a loss. Am I nervous? A little. My sell strategy starts at $800 up to $1600 (arbitrary numbers pulled out of my ass but documented in my spreadsheet) or at a stop loss at $200.\n\nSo sure, I'm buying on a short term down trend speculating that a long term up trend is still a thing that might be real. Also when I exit the market I hold 5% in bitcoin as a savings (so I don't really exit). \n\nWhat do you people think. Is this a bastardized and bound to fail version of dollar cost average? ": 5, "If you want to have a portion of your portfolio in bitcoin but don't want to have to play the market or you just hate trading in general, there is absolutely nothing wrong with dollar cost averaging. Of course you can potentially make more money by doing successful trades. No fucking shit. You can also *lose* **more** money if you do a lot of bad trades than had you just dollar cost averaged with a set plan rather than gamble like a maniac.\n\nDollar cost averaging or buying once and holding is for people who want to take the leap into bitcoin and don't want to actively trade, seeing where things go in the long term. So many people in this subreddit seem to hate that notion. Yes, if you DCA'd all of 2014 you're down year over year. It was a bad year for bitcoin. Could anyone have known just how bad it was gonna be with absolute certainty? If I had a crystal ball I wouldn't need to dollar cost average. But the reality is if I want to make good trades I need to put a lot of work and research into it and actively manage things. That's a fucking *job*. Some people are busy with life and don't have time for that, or they just don't enjoy trading and would rather not do it. But they still think bitcoin is awesome and going to be really big in the future. So DCA is a less risky and a super easy discipline to get a person to put a portion of their portfolio into bitcoin.\n\nImagine if 1/100th of the world's population did this. 70 million people put like 10 bucks into bitcoin every week like it's a bankless long-term savings account.

The demand for physical Gold is extremely high and has been for years, countries buy by the ton and cannot get enough, yet the price of Gold is low. The government crush Gold by selling paper Gold futures on COMEX using fake printed monopoly money called "USD". Now each ounce of Gold is owned 24 times. Once physical Gold for delivery runs out - soon - the whole scam will be spectacularly revealed and the price of Gold will reach fair value.\n\nLikewise with the stock market. A high stock market implies a strong economy when we all know that the reverse is true. Also a high stock market makes people feel wealthier and therefore they spend more.\n\nIn fact the government use rooms of supercomputers and algorithmic trading to increase the value of stocks at the push of a button without the stocks actually getting settled and allocated to a buyer.

There are no new buyers - just the same pool of speculators and enthusiasts so no new demand. At the same time miners are having to dump most of their mined BTC to buy more resources just to stay in business. Merchants for the most part instantly convert BTC to fiat to mitigate the exchange risk - even more so now the price is going down.\n\nSo the BTC price fall is feeding on itself. It will only stop when miners can no longer profit and have to suspend mining operations and merchants no longer perceive an exchange rate risk.\n\nWhat price will that be? Who knows? The price must be getting there though based on the cost of mining.\n\nOf course when the price goes back up, the miners will start up again and the price will be suppressed again until it finds equilibrium.\n\nThis implies that the price will stay low until a whole new raft of buyers comes in to the market and BTC goes mainstream and right now we seem a long way from that.\n\nAs for manipulation - BTC is doing just fine by itself without the need for governments and banks to intervene.': 1, 'So, in 2013 bitcoin went up by a factor 60.

I have tried to give as much detail as possible on the procedure, however please understand that the risk algorithms are proprietary and therefore cannot be divulged in full detail.\n\nOKCoin's risk management system detects positions that are about to be forced liquidated. The system makes a preemptive move and acquires these positions from the user. These positions are transferred (via compulsory acquisition) from the user's account to a risk management system account. The price at which this occurs is calculated with the assumption that all of the user balance will be used to cover the loss. \n\nThe reason for the slightly early call was because the system is actually trying to avoid a complete loss. The algorithm takes into account a number of factors about the position and the market. If the system had executed at $296.89, then it would run the risk of creating a loss which would then leave a negative balance in the user's account. Furthermore, through our socialised loss mechanism, this loss would then be shared by all users. \n\nIt is important to note that this compulsory acquisition is not done inside the matching engine, and therefore won\xe2\x80\x99t show up in the charts or market data. The system then subsequently puts out (or tries to \xe2\x80\x98offload\xe2\x80\x99) the liquidation order back into the market. If the order is matched then it is successfully offloaded back into the market. In this case, the particular order was matched at a price equal to or higher than the 24hr low of $298. This therefore explains why $297.61 is lower than the low of $298.\n\nIt may appear that the system has made a profit on the trade here, however it is very important to note that the system operates with the objective of being neutral, and hence that profit is handed back to the user\xe2\x80\x99s account. Those of you who use OKCoin, can review this amount in \xe2\x80\x9cLiquidation balance\xe2\x80\x9d drop down option in the \xe2\x80\x9cTransactions\xe2\x80\x9d page.\n\nThanks,\nOKCoin Management": 3, "if price got that close to your liquidation price then you weren't trading you were gambling -- need to re-think your risk management system otherwise you are going to be walking on pins and needles around margin calls": -9, 'What about other futures sites? 796 (50x leverage on something already this volatile, wtf)?

Same as before. ~~The reason I made this comment now is so that you can go onto okcoin and see for yourself that I didn't doctor it before the 1128 expires too.~~ \n\nBoth positions were forced liquidated about $1 under the actual price.\n\nThe response OKCoin support gave me was pointing to their rules which stated:\n\n> OKCoin Futures platform features cross-margin system, compartmentalized margin system and price controlled forced liquidation. While the price controlled forced liquidation system is mandatory, user can only chooses one between cross-margin and compartmentalized margin system.When a trader opts for the cross margin system, then all funds held in the Futures account will be considered as 'Margin'. When the investor's margin rate ((equity/ margin) - 0.1) breaches 0%, forced liquidation will be triggered. Losses due to failure to implement forced liquidation will be borne by traders who profited from the contract at the moment when the contract delivers.When investors opt for compartmentalized margin system, the required margin will be used as fixed margin to collateralize trader\xe2\x80\x99s positions. When the trader\xe2\x80\x99s contract\xe2\x80\x99s specific side\xe2\x80\x99s gain to loss ratio breaches \xe2\x80\x93 90%, then the specific contract\xe2\x80\x99s specific side will be liquated, while this contract\xe2\x80\x99s other side will not be affected.\n\n> margin system: All the Bitcoin and Litecoin assets held in the traders\xe2\x80\x99 Futures account will be considered as 'Margin'. The margin level fluctuates with the market prices. When the futures prices move against the traders, his equality balance will decrease. When the investor's margin ratio breaches 0%, there will be a forced liquidation. In an event of forced liquidation, the loss will equal to or slightly less than the total amount of equity held by the trader. To reduce the chance of forced liquidation, traders should open a smaller number of contracts and reduce the multiple of leverage. The larger the margin is, the less the number of contracts, the smaller the multiple of leverage, the less likely the forced liquidation.\n\n> Compartmentalized margin system: The required margin will be used as margin, this margin will be fixed, i.e, it will not fluctuates as futures prices. When the prices of futures move against the trader, the unrealized gain will decrease. When the gain to loss ratio of a specific contract on specific side breaches \xe2\x80\x93 90%, then the position will be liquidated, the loss that the trader sustained from the forced liquidation will be equal or close to the fixed margin assigned to the specific contract \xe2\x80\x98s specific side.\n\n> Forced liquidation system: This is designed to avoid a domino-style serial forced liquidations. OKCoin uses a limited price forced liquidation system. When forced liquidation is triggered, the objective is to liquidate a user\xe2\x80\x99s position completely, or the specific contract\xe2\x80\x99s specific side gain to loss ratio equals -100%, instead of liquidation according to the market price. The advantage of this approach is to minimize the effect of forced liquidation on the market prices, thus reducing volatility. If the forced liquidation of contracts cannot be completed by the delivery time, the loss occurred thereof will be deducted proportionately from all traders who profited from the contract according to the amount of their winnings.\n": 9, "That's still not an excuse for it liquidating his position ahead of the liquidation price, *cough* *cough* shill": 11, '+1 trading futures is gambling while your gamble...

Because this current formation is so wide, the projected downside is pretty significant.  By column count (12 boxes) we could see a low in the $315 range.  If we use the last breakdown column as a guide, the projection is $300 (down 15 boxes.)  Yikes.\n\nWe broke through support at $365, and we broke through the negative breakdown point at $345.  This was after not doing anything for a couple of days.\n\nSo, going forward, we need to see reversal at the $355 point (we are not too far from here.)  That move would keep this formation alive and 13 boxes wide\xe2\x80\x94which would make a long term positive breakthrough that much more powerful.\n\nIn the stock markets we are seeing some contagion from the far east hitting us.  If you are a Zero Hedge reader, this is the beginning of the end.  If you are a Marketwatch reader, its just a blip on the way to another 20% gain.  Of course, I exaggerate in both cases.  My own feeling is that we are in one heck of a bubble and things need to cool off for a while.\n\nAs a holder of precious metals as well, I was thrilled to see Silver and Gold move a little bit.\n\nI think we see more upward movement as the stocks continue to decline.  If China is as bad off as Shanghai showed us last night I thing we see BTC shoot up for a couple of days.  People are looking for safety.  Gold and silver are manipulated by the big boys.  perhaps BTC is the way out, and up.\n\nThat is my update for today\n\nPersonal stuff after this point\n============-\nI went to my moms house in Vermont and found the pump well burned out after forty years.  All of the water drained out of the house.  The radiator froze on the sun porch, and all of the water from the forced hot water flowed out onto the rug.\n\nThree days getting the plumbers in there.  Two days of flushing toilets with the spare water.  But we have two cords of wood, so i was toasty warm.\n\nThe numbers and heater guys were fantastic.  They took care not to screw me.  They explained and showed me stuff.  They let me help pull the well pump out.  (500 feet of well pipe full of water is heavy!)\n\nThe whole world is going to hell.  But you have to keep laughing.

So 12 columns wide means a column of twelve boxes in the direction of the break out or break down. \n\nThe second way is to go back to the last time the pattern "broke" in the same direction.  In this case you have to go back a few columns to where it broke down 15 boxes. \n\nI usually post both in order to give a range.  \n\nNothing is perfect in this world, but the ranges are usually pretty good bets.  \n': 2}, ('What books for a beginner in trading would you recomend?', 9): {'THE thing is, you must be a PIRATE in order to download the pdf and still keep the authorities at BAY.': 4, 'they will be back (i hope) until then: torrentz.com\n': 1, 'Not anymore \n\nRip tpb': 2, 'babypips.com is free and pretty awesome.': 4, 'Daytrading for dummies is quick and useful.': 0, "I'm a big fan of your blog already.

There are three potential reasons for the sharp spike in price.\n\n1. Buying hype based on news of Microsoft/Bitcoin integration.\n\n2. A whale testing their weight in coins to see how big of a splash they can make.\n\n3. Price manipulation from one of the exchanges, triggering a margin call on everyone shorting BTC.\n\nBe very cautious when dealing with this type of sudden increase in price. If you\xe2\x80\x99re fortunate to buy close to the bottom or catch it quickly on the way up, then it is wise to set a sell order at a reasonable profit to ensure it gets executed. Be realistic about what price you sell at, if you put an order too high you will miss the wave and get caught holding your bag with both hands. It\xe2\x80\x99s generally advised to sell for just a little bit under where you anticipate resistance.

It\xe2\x80\x99s such an ingrained routine, watching prices go up and down becomes clockwork. The only reason anyone loses money is because trading is a zero sum gain\xe2\x80\xa6 for every trade there is a winner and loser. At around 15:15 EST a dump ensued, surprise surprise. I\xe2\x80\x99ve noticed that on most dumps prices tend to rebound 50% of pre-dump levels. If you can have a buy order to catch the dump close to the bottom, then there is usually near instant opportunity to make immediate profit. If you\xe2\x80\x99re quick on the trigger you may even execute several trades during this time because volatility is highest after dumps.\n\nhttp://www.dailytradingprofits.com/2455/bitcoin-market-report-121214/': 5, 'This^^^': 2, 'We can but speculate.': 2, "I'm going to have to figure out how to parse this information.

The daily is too much noise to fuck with': 12, 'The events of the last 24 hours have made me start to think about the convergence of several technological trends, and about how they effect Bitcoin. \n\nFor years now, we\'ve known about the "Long Tail" effect, [as described by Chris Anderson](http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/12.10/tail.html) -- the basic idea is that much of the content consumed on the internet amounts to highly specific, niche products appealing to only a few people. In the past, these products would have never been created because they had no financial viability in a brick-and-mortar distribution model.\n\nThat book of silly cat photos would never sell in a Barnes and Noble store, but it might get some traction at Amazon (which was the original example of a Long Tail) because they\'re not limited physically by how many products they can sell. And if it\'s a purely digital good (an imgur gallery of cat photos) it can be popular with a very specific audience and can even be monetized. (Think 4,000 upvotes on /r/funny with 10x that many Adsense impressions).\n\nThe internet has allowed previously nonviable products to suddenly become viable, and even financially successful.  \n\nMeanwhile, the growth of Social Media has allowed new business models for content creators -- one of the most successful being Youtube -- which has allowed the development of totally new genres of content. Think here of the "Let\'s Play" videos popular with gamers and "haul" videos popular with young fashion-conscious types. There are people making their entire livelihood by posting [Sims 4 let\'s plays](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCAQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2FLifeSimmer&ei=dhyKVPD7E9btoAShyoL4Dg&usg=AFQjCNG8qvD14-rcJkMK9UkFISg6auSgDQ&sig2=zotAY6SErdnfF3_Rct6zAw&bvm=bv.81456516,d.cGU) or [Makeup tutorials.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCUQFjAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fuser%2FMichellePhan&ei=mhyKVIGWFYTnoATZp4K4AQ&usg=AFQjCNF_zaDwJDSlyQTijODO0uhH8O2yOw&sig2=-UPsfebPiqdPDRS4SXACqg&bvm=bv.81456516,d.cGU) All these ventures are catering to relatively small audiences of a few hundred thousand and monetizing this content with traditional advertising and/or interstitials. \n\nAt the same time, we\'ve seen the massive growth in crowd-funded projects. Many people know about the highlights, [such as Star Citizen\'s $65+ million in donations](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals), but there are thousands of other examples of small projects: games, books, movies, being created through small contributions of very specific, niche audiences. People apparently *really* want to play old-school isometric role-playing games, but publishers weren\'t making them, and so creative types went straight to their niche audience. The results are Wasteland 2, Shadowrun, and Project Eternity among others, all funded by small investors who are also players.\n\nIn other words, there is enormous power in providing very specific content to very specific markets. And people in those markets will fund that content that they care so passionately about. But until now there has been a missing link -- a secure, common platform for micropayments. Kickstarter can facilitate credit card donations -- for a fee. Youtube can push Adsense content, etc. But these methods are clunky, only scale at certain market-share thresholds and are problematic for young people and the un- and underbanked (The latter [being 27% of the US population](https://www.fdic.gov/householdsurvey/) at last estimate). They\'re also expensive, not spontaneous, and they\'re rather high friction -- it is not easy to, for example, send $3 to someone who makes awesome Youtube videos easily and without revealing personal information. \n\nWe have journeyed some distance down the long tail, but we have even further to go.\n\nSo the question is, what is the digital equivalent of putting out a hat and playing a guitar on a street corner? What\'s the digital equivalent of the barista tip jar? \n\n*Simple. It\'s attaching a Bitcoin QR code.*\n\nI can see a future in which people are both creators and consumers of content. Maybe my short story gets $5 in tips and validates my hobby, a 16 year old with a guitar receives $50 in Youtube tips from a couple dozens adoring fans, my code contribution helps to fix a flaw in an open source software project and a grateful user send me $10 in the forum thread, a modder collects $1,000 in tips from 2,000 users for a total re-skin of The Elder Scrolls VI -- our digital communities become a nexus of financial incentive and reward that encourages skilled and entrepreneurial individuals to create new and wonderful things.\n\nThese won\'t be full-time jobs for most, but they do add strong rewards for those passionate about their hobbies and their communities. I was floored the first time someone tipped me. I\'m not alone, [check out this great but buried response in the daily thread yesterday.](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2oxtog/daily_discussion_thursday_december_11_2014/cms9je9) Small tips have huge impacts.\n\nA secure, decentralized currency is the final piece of the puzzle in creating an emergent digital economy. And even more significantly, it only takes a cheap smartphone or computer to access this financial network. There are no age requirements, no geographic requirements, no language requirements and only minimal technical hurdles. \n\nWhen you begin to see how the pieces of this puzzle come together, it adds another, even more compelling use case for Bitcoin than the ones traditionally advocated -- a world in which anything we create can be financially rewarded and the incentives to create new, high-quality, content increase dramatically. It means the democratization of content, the completion of the media revolution, and the flattening of barriers for entry into the world of performance, art, design, and software development. \n\nIt\'s actually pretty revolutionary if you think about it.\n\n(And this got long, sorry...)': 73, 'Assuming you are ahead on those coins so have a happier holiday!

Although its demise was painful, it was a blessing in disguise. Now in 2014 we see an industry with a huge diversification in exchanges and a large spread in risk. The impact is that profits among the exchanges are shared and they are going to be squeezed, with only the strongest coming out on top.\n\nI name professionalism as a problem too as you'll notice a worryingly large proportion of industry leaders in this space lacking professional financial services experience. While not all of the values in the 'old money' banking sector were perfect, it is important to acknowledge the role of proper risk management in Bitcoin's growing financial services sector.

You can\'t view a no-fee exchange with its wash sales and volume pumping as the same animal that is the fee exchange -- it is really an entirely different model and should be understood that way and not compared to bfx stamp etc. There are pros and cons of both and I will leave it that. As far as how they are going to make money I think you are a bit naive because you admit not knowing the difference between the eastern exchanges yet OKC has an international site WITH fees specifically for futures which is booming currently. On .cn they have fees on withdrawals and I am sure they add margin liquidity and take a rate of return on that similar to bfx.\n\n2. You are just throwing around hyperbole on this one -- they made a choice from their viewpoint that showing the orderbook does give large players an edge to try and force prices down to levels in the orderbook -- evidence is pretty obvious with bfx an btc-e flashcrash, which did not happen on OKC, NetProfits on trading view took credit for causing the btc-e flash crash then more recently tried to do it on bfx but bfx has since implemented speed bumps to prevent this. I addressed zero fee trading above -- you are looking at a different animal trade accordingly and stop saying things need to be like the past (fee-based) -- this is no different then floor traders who claimed that the NASDAQ and electronic exchange was "fake" because there were no people yelling at each other and passing paper to make the trade official -- again different model entirely.\n\n3.

Please correct any inaccuracies if I make them (I sometimes confuse which eastern exchanges did what), but please also answer the concerns directly. I know Zane is watching, so he\'s welcome to answer too.\n\n1. Please justify no-fee trading and the trade washing that comes with it. Please also address what this means for OKC\'s profit methods. They say "making money is not their focus", but that\'s awfully hard to swallow coming from a company with so much money invested into it. When they do finally decide to profit, how will they do so?\n\n2. Please address OKC only sharing 5% of the order book. They say it\'s to avoid manipulation, but there is no evidence that sharing full orderbooks has facilitated manipulation on any other exchanges. Additionally, if that is their reasoning, why do they allow zero-fee trading, which has a much more direct influence on manipulation.\n\n3. It is evident to me that OKC has enlisted high-profile traders, like you, to promote their product to Westerners. Can you confirm or deny this? If so, what kind of benefits were provided to you. Can OKC comprehensively disclose what strategic marketing methods like this were used? Zane obviously works hard to maintain exposure to English-speakers, does OKCoin have someone that does the same for Easterners?\n\n4. Please address the accusations of inflated volume, and doing things like doubling volume data to "compete" with other Chinese exchanges. (http://www.coindesk.com/chinese-bitcoin-exchange-okcoin-accused-faking-trading-data/)\n\n5. Why is their lending program invite-only? Does OKC have an open swap market like BFX, or do traders just trust that the lending is real?\n\n6. When everyone had a big chunk taken out their futures profits, they all pretended like they read the agreement, I think they just didn\'t want to look stupid and were happy to make some profit. With 20x leverage (and probably 50x soon, since OKC likes copying other exchanges), isn\'t this a problem that can become catastrophic? Why not use actual backing and settling?

Although the purchase price of my miner is a sunk cost and therefore should be completely discounted and disregarded, I am disinclined to throw it out before it pays for itself (or at least the winter is over and I don't need a space heater any more).\n3.

The market is too uncertain, and the value of the equipment will predictably be zero in a short time, either because of a new generation of chips or because the BTC market goes down significantly.

It appears that Bitcoin is on a biennial cycle. To reiterate some of what was discussed in yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s post, 2011 had a bull charge with 2200% gains and dropped into a bear cycle in 2012 losing 60% of previous peak value.\n\n2013 had another bull charge, giving even higher gains of 8200% and 2014 has been a bear cycle losing 66% of it\xe2\x80\x99s value. Do you see a trend?\n\nOur support levels during these bear cycles are consistently higher than previous lows. Regardless of the minutia of price action over the past couple months, I\xe2\x80\x99m very bullish about 2015. My estimate is not only based on the overall market trend but also on the fact that 2014 was the most successful year for building up Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s infrastructure.\n\nOur historical bull runs range between 1600-8200%. If we were to continue along that trend then we would see prices range between $4800- $24,600. At first glance these prices seem outrageous but entirely possible. Our current support level is sustained by less than .01% of the world\xe2\x80\x99s population. With a limited supply currently at 13,641,900, where do you think the prices would be if we had 100 million users? We now have a tipping platform with a reach of over a billion users over all the big social media platforms. Crypto is currently running a monopoly on micro-payments and tipping. There are no other viable methods to fill this niche market. Tipping someone money is by far one of the best strategies to make user adoption viral.\n\nYes it\xe2\x80\x99s true that we can never accurately predict the future and that the markets are full of anomalies. That said, the future is not entirely divorced from the past and all circumstances have cause and effect. Isolating events fails to see the bigger picture. All causes set in motion in 2014 point towards greater user adoption in 2015.

So they will move into stable currencies and hard assets over bitcoin because they hold their value well and are easily tradeable for goods and services in every day life.  Bitcoin still isn't easily usable to pay for goods and services.\n\nIn short, BTC only benefits when currency is fleeing a country due to capital controls.  Russia hasn't reached the level of dramatic capital controls yet.": 1, 'Great write-up.

Therefore, I don't think Russian regulations on large amounts of capital flight will be much of a negative for BTC because I don't think those entities are participating in the BTC market anyway.  \n\nIndividual ownership wont be affected by the regulations - if anything, I'd expect a small increase in value, as it is a means to move money without the government knowing.

The Russian Central Bank hiked their main interest rate by 650 basis points overnight in a surprise unannounced move, raising the rate from 10.5% to 17%.  Folks, if you don't have a concept of the magnitude of that raise in rates, to put it in perspective, we typically don't move rates by more than 0.25-0.5% at a time here in the US, and even a small move like that can dramatically affect the markets.  \n\nThe surprise 6.5% raise in interest rates also appears not to have stemmed the tide either.  At first, the Rouble bounced about 10% in value, but that was quickly given back and the currency was down as much as 22% today.  In response, Russian stock markets were down 12% today.\n\nNow, for BTC-RUR, people are trying to get their Roubles exchanged for USD, Euros, or hard goods like foodstuffs.  While some would say that Russian's should be piling into BTC, bitcoin is still relatively unstable, so it doesn't serve as a good safe haven.  USD is a good store of value at this time in Russia, and will be a very valuable currency to possess, whereas BTC is not viewed positively by the Russian government because of it's ability to skirt capital control laws.\n\nBut that's really the next shoe to drop here:  Russian capital controls.  They will have to stem the flow of capital out of the country (approximately $140B in 2014 alone) via onerous regulations that will hurt their economy even further than it already has been.  With oil prices hitting new mid-term lows with each new day, their economic prospects are looking pretty rough.

A share of stock is like owning a properly on a Monopoly board--you are entitled to a share of revenue, and you can sell or liquidate it for cash one day.

The only thing that can cause a strong, positive impact on the price of Bitcoin is additional (marginal) demand.  What you're missing is the connection between sharp stock market declines and increased marginal demand for BTC.  I use the term 'marginal' because there is always a (fluctuating) base level of demand in the markets to purchase BTC, but what we are interested here is the marginal amount of additional demand that moves into BTC due to the external factors you're talking about.\n\nIn the case of a stock market decline, investors aren't typically leaving the market during sell offs.  They are rotating into other (more defensive) sectors or sitting in cash (in the anticipation of reentering a new position whenever an opportunity presents itself).  But the stock market going down doesn't mean that investors are going to flee the market and run for BTC.  Bitcoin is still pretty unstable, and still has a rather small market cap (approximately $4.5B today) in comparison to more traditional investments.  It's not really a viable option for most investors to invest in yet.  Eventually it will be a viable option for investors, but right now it's still onerous and difficult to move large sums of cash into BTC.   \n\nSame thing for currencies.  People aren't going to flee the Rouble for Bitcoins because it's very difficult to actually spend bitcoins in Russia for the average person.  They'd be locking their money into a safe & untouchable cryptocurrency (untouchable from government capital controls that is), but the currency itself would still be pretty useless to the average russian citizen.  However, the US Dollar is very valuable and very usable for russian citizens.  So the citizens there will convert their Roubles into USD or Euro's or hard goods because all of those options will hold their value far better than the Rouble.  BTC can't really say the same.\n\nIn my opinion, the only times BTC benefits from a currency crisis is when the local citizens need to get money out of the country, such as what occurred in Cyprus.  At that point, BTC becomes one of the best options, and demand picks up.  But in a standard currency crisis like Russia's, people just need to get their money into something that will hold its value, so they look for the safe haven currencies, not BTC.\n\n": 8, 'Right. Good question. Fundamentally, bitcoin should be valued by its usefulness. Currencies gain their value from three things: demand, supply and velocity.\n\nDemand is people wanting to use bitcoin to buy stuff, transfer value, etc. Adoption. Supply is how much bitcoin is available for sale at any price (not the same as how many coins "exist"). Velocity is how long people hold on to coins after they get them. The higher the velocity, the lower the value. You can sort of think of velocity as part of the supply in a way. \n\nWell, to be simple: the fundamental value of bitcoin is based on how many people buy it to use it, how many coins are for sale, and how willing people are to hold coins in their wallets rather than exchange or spend them quickly. \n\n(This is not to say there isn\'t room for speculation: Like how corn or oil is valuable, yet speculated on.
