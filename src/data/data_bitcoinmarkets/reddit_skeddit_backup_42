I've had my textbooks tell me that Bollinger bands can be accompanied by either an Exponential Moving Average or a Simple Moving Average - use the one that makes you more money in your trading plan. :)\n\nAs for stops, you'll ideally set your stop-loss according to the lower band of those bands. This is grounded in the idea that if the price breaks the lower bound of the ATR band, it has not only broken the support line (the one you'll likely be drawing on your charts along with those bands), but it has also broken so far below that line that it is very much likely not just a retracement, but a complete breakout of the trend, and the stop-limit will be triggered to sell and prevent you from accidentally incurring extreme losses beyond what you already may have lost.": 1, "I don't really understand the explanation of Average True Range Bands; Does that mean to subtract an Avg true range (perhaps 20 period, i assume) from the center line of the bollinger band?

These two complement one another well in a trading plan, since one measures volatility and the other momentum.*\n\nAs a trader, the above image should be a very welcome sight to you: a general idea of where the price could go as it moves forward, with regard to its statistical variance. This is like having the white lines on the side of the road, when you can\'t see the road at night. (Except that in trading Bitcoin, the price will at times jump right off the road.)\n\n> *"You use Bollinger bands to display the price in the context of a norm set at the 20-day moving average, which is the number of days that Bollinger\'s research showed is the most effective in detecting variance in U.S. equities. The bands display *relative* highs and *relative* lows in the context of the moving average \xe2\x80\x95 they\'re adaptive to the price by the amount of the standard deviation. The bands are, so to speak, moving standard deviations.*\n\n> *-Barbara Rockefeller, author of Technical Analysis for Dummies, 2nd ed.*\n\nUnlike in the road analogy I used earlier, it\'s actually okay and common to see a price trend "walk up" or "walk down" the Bollinger band, meaning the price is either right along the upper bound or clinging to the lower bound as it trends. This isn\'t an extreme as one might think - this is actually a signal that the trend will continue. Be on the lookout for breakouts, however - those exist with Bollinger bands just as they exist elsewhere in technical analysis.\n\n>*[Notice how the the two major uptrends](http://i.imgur.com/X8yeF6M.png) around midday Jan 30th and early in the morning on Feb 1st walk the band up to their peaks, even leading ahead of the band. If you see these in realtime, you\'ll likely have confidence these trends will continue so long as they walk the band. The same is true of downtrends, seen on this chart very early on Jan 30th.*\n\nSo how do we know when a trend is ending if it\'s walking right along the band? We look for two key events:\n\n> 1. The price will move away from its band and approach or even cross over the average centerline. If you\'re following momentum you may see such indicators reflect this with a reduced intensity as the trend comes to an end.\n\n> 2. Watch for the squeeze. The bands begin to constrict and shrink. In an uptrend that\'s ending, a contraction of the Bollinger bands signals that traders expect the price not to continue higher during this move, and that volatility is decreasing accordingly - they\'re not excited to be buying this security anymore, and look to take a profit when their trading plan properly signals them to. \n\nOne of the issues with using Bollinger bands is that **you can\'t use them to plan for a stop** (you know, [stop-losses](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stop-lossorder.asp).) This is because the bands are symmetrical - the distance from the centerline to the high point is equal to the distance from the centerline to the low point. This does not help when trying to determine if a breakout will be trend-changing, because trend-changing moves need to be more drastic than recent trended moves, which Bollinger bands won\'t emphasize. Instead, you can employ the use of [Average True Range Bands](http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/how-to-set-trading-price-stops-with-average-true-r.html). \n\nAs with all other indicators, the above that you\'ve learned about are best employed together alongside other indicators! Momentum/RSI and volatility/Bollinger bands are great together if you\'re just starting out with your trading plan.\n\n#**In Closing**\n\nWe\'ve covered a number of indicators, and I would like to start putting some of this stuff together in the next few posts.

The last time, it was China.  This time, it will be Wall St.\n\nThe source of the bubble occurring earlier rather than later is simply looking at the time between bubbles, seeing how it is decreasing, and recognizing that technology increases exponentially.  It took half a century for most people to adopt a telephone, but only 3 years for most people to adopt a smartphone.  It\'s also based upon the idea that "this time is different" is almost always a bad assumption and there is no hard evidence to suggest the cycle is going to break.\n\nHistorically, increased usage of bitcoins has never resulted in bubbles.  There was significantly increased (relative) usage in July and August, with many small stores suddenly accepting them.  Bitcoins are always worth more than they should be because of people who use them as a store of value.  The bubbles occur when people buy them for investment, not for daily spending.\n\nThe April crash happened largely because people were unable to determine what the price was because quotes were delayed by 30 minutes, so they just sold.  \n\nAs to what exchange problems could happen, it would probably be something like BTC-e being shut down at the wrong time, right after the price goes up by $500 in 24 hours.  Or maybe Bitstamp has some sort of bug in its software that only manifests with high volumes, or they don\'t hire enough customer support personnel and people take that as a sign they are failing.  Or, like in April, a DDoS attack takes offline one of the exchanges and people worry about being unable to get their money out.  Or, people don\'t worry initially but the DDoS attack causes the other exchanges to become overloaded with too many customers.\n\nThe other problem that could crash the next bubble is the 1MB transaction limit being reached and transactions suddenly taking 20 blocks to confirm.  In this scenario, you see people with coins at exchanges unable to transfer them to other addresses or to use them to pay for goods, so they panic sell because they don\'t want to take the risk of being unable to send coins back to the exchange.': 3, "Bitstamp isn't responding to their E-Mails, and they have hundreds of customers awaiting 45 bitcoins.

The last time, it was China. This time, it will be Wall St.\n\nWall St won't be buying off these existing exchanges.  They'll only start buying once more institutionally focussed exchanges come into play.  ": 1, 'I didn\'t sell all my coins - only about 10%.  I want to see if I can make a few bucks on what I think is going to be an impending correction caused by yet another exchange disaster.  If I\'m right, I\'ll buy at $700 (it might go lower, but I won\'t be greedy) and earn another bitcoin.  If not, then I\'ll buy back in at the all time high and only lose 3% of my bitcoins.  I may simply buy 3% more if that happens, because I won\'t have actually lost any money, just the possibility to earn 3% more money.\n\nEarlier, I was bullish in that this China deadline wasn\'t all it was cracked up to be.  Now, there are some rumors that a crackdown is coming, so there\'s some cause for concern.  However, that\'s not what convinced me to be cautious.  I think I was simply mistaken before, and changed my mind.\n\nWhat I realized over the weekend was that the exchanges cannot handle the volume that will be incoming in the next bubble.  Each time there has been a bubble, a new round of exchanges has come online that replaced the previous exchanges with more professional software and customer service.  During the first bubble, it was anything goes, and all the exchanges were either hacked or shut down by the government.  During the April bubble, we had hacks like BitInstant, who provided less than "instant" service and charged huge fees, and Mt Gox, which directly caused the crash because of its inefficient trading engine.\n\nDuring the November bubble, we had three better (but not good) exchanges: Gox, bitstamp, and btc-e, and Gox had improved since the previous bubble.  Yet, again, once the bubble reached its peak, things happened that wouldn\'t occur in a professional market:  for example, Coinbase "ran out of bitcoins."  How does a company run out of the only product it sells?\n\nThe next bubble will need Wall Street quality exchanges if the price is to run up to $10,000.  Bitcoins are ready for that bubble, and the demand is there waiting to explode.  But while bitcoins are increasing exponentially, software deveopment technology is not increasing at the same rate.  So while there were 2 years and 7 months, respectively, for exchanges to develop between the last bubbles, 3 months is not enough time for the next round of real players to get better exchanges up and running.  There needs to be exchanges that can handle huge volume and high-frequency trading.  These exchanges need come online and undercut Coinbase, because 1% is too high for mass adoption.\n\nMany people here complain about a US-centric view, but there is a reason for that.  I\'m only writing about exchanges in the United States because it\'s becoming clear that the US government is unexpectedly the friendliest towards bitcoins, that\'s where the innovation is happening, and that\'s where all the big companies accepting bitcoins are based.  But there are no domestic exchanges, and it is too difficult or risky for most companies to wire money overseas.\n\nSo my thoughts now are that the next bubble is going to be delayed not by merchant adoption or user demand, but by exchange infrastructure.  I realized that this has always been the limiting factor with bitcoins.  If the bubble does begin in two weeks, it will be cut short by Coinbase "running out of bitcoins," Gox becoming insolvent as the current bank run accelerates, btc-e being shut down for violating the law, or bitstamp being unable to provide adequate customer service.': 6, "Here is the crux, where is the risk? Do people think that mtgox is going to shut down and run away with everyone's money? Or do you just mean risk that the spread between coinbase/btc-e and mtgox will get higher?\n\nI know that others have reported problems, but I've never had a problems sending or receiving BTC through mtgox.": 3, 'Not getting my SEPA transfers out either...

All I have is my coinbase account w/ instabuy approved and a tab left open with the bitcoinwisdom ticker.\n\nI doubt we'll see anything lower than 750 for the next week or so, because there simply isn't anything that could happen to bring it down any lower. We just settled out of a bubble, and like you said, unless we have another bigger bubble, i believe the price of bitcoin will just slowly creep up.\n\nSo rather than risk daytrading and such, I slowly accumulate bitcoin once a week or so, or when there's a significant price drop.\n\nBtw is there a way to setup coinbase + a bot and set high low limits on buying/selling?": 1, 'Would you mind elaborating on why they have temporarily shut down the robocoin ATM in Vancouver?': 2}, ('mcxNOW back up', 5): {'The way they have dealt with clients during halt was just horrible!

I chose a gamble to stay with mcxNOW because I figured if the fees sold for 0.2-0.5btc once, and they are now 0.09, if the exchanges gets back online it will reach those levels once more as it was gaining popularity (also cause I believed in the exchange, have to believe in something). \n\nBut yeah thats my experience with the exchange; don't invest money your not willing to lose, the only people that lost money were the ones that panic sold.\n\n If RS is a scam artist, he is certaintly putting a lot of effort in his scam, I'd like to see someone else rival his extremely fast exchange.\n": 5, 'Pt. 2 indeed .. lol\n\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1rhcgn/i_lost_most_of_my_bitcoins_today_heres_why/\n\nhttp://cryptosource.org/mcxnow-shutting-down/\n\nwhoever is looking forward to this exchange, just type: "mcxnow" on the search bar, you\'ll find much more similar posts..\n\neven if they (or should I say he) is/are working seriously, with these past "scandals", I don\'t think they\'ll survive long...': 2, 'Its a good site..I have a ton of bitcoin there and I trust RealSolid.

This slowly leaked away, resulting in an overnight reversal down to 800.  This changed our sell signal to $769, which would be a double bottom break down.  Our buy signal, on the next column of Xs becomes $840, which is $10 lower than the last one.  Our bearish objective, in the case of a break down is $660.\n\nThe formation is now wider, at 10 columns.  This indicates building pressure behind the next movement, as the "battle" between the buys and sells has been a practical stalemate since the beginning of the month.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThis was a funky weekend.  There were rumors of China defaults and cash transaction freezes (some of which I bought hook line and sinker--sorry about that.)  After the debacle last Thursday and Friday in the stock market, there was talk of how liquidity issues would impact Bitcoin.  And there was all sorts of funky stuff going on at Mt Gox, which I really don\'t have an answer for.  But the end result is stepped up a couple of boxes and then sank in the same routine we have seen all month.\n\nI think we are in a holding pattern until we figure out what is going to happen at the end of the week going int the Chinese New Year celebration and the issues with cash transactions in China.  As I\'ve said before, the width of this formation indicates a pretty strong movement--one way or the other.  If we break down, the sell signal trigger could be fast and furious.  \n\nIf we break up, look for activity to pickup long before we hit the "buy" signal.  Watch the 3 box reversal point at $830 as the indication that buyers are winning this round.  The rise up will look like yesterday\'s pop from $805 to $834--it will be quick with pretty good volume.  Then it will slow down, but it should keep rising.   \n\nI would caution about hopping on that up train too quickly--the rise up is going to be slower than any drop--so make sure the rise up is "real" before dropping dollars, euros, yuan, pounds, rubles, seashells, wampum, beads, or shiny little pieces of tinfoil that just sparkle so pretty, into a movement which  may appear to share the same trajectory as a North Korean Missile Test.\n\nResources\n\nhttp://www.investorsintelligence.com/x/using_point_and_figure_charts.html\n\nhttp://www.marketedge.com/MarketEdge/DRME/drPFChart.aspx\n\nhttp://support.stockcharts.com/forums/30077/entries/21293\n\nedit:  Formatting Only, Saying dollars is US Centric.

Example: Americans are \'generally\' withdrawing money, Chinese are pumping money in. Gox has loads of YEN, no dollars, but BTC prices are rising and rising. Therefor, you can\'t withdraw dollars, because Gox ain\'t got none, despite your coins being worth a high dollar value. \n\nIf Gox were operating purely as a bitcoin exchange, they would have every single dollar that they owe out to account holders, because each one would have been deposited by someone else. The Chinese are pumping them full of yuan? They *owe* yuan in equal measure to people selling bitcoin *for* yuan. Those same Chinese want to withdraw lots of dollars? Theoretically every dollar should be accounted for from someone else\'s deposit that they used to buy bitcoin from the Chinese.\n\nEdit: remembered this after the fact, but it doesn\'t change what I said below this - Gox *will* match bids/asks of different currencies (i.e. one person wants to buy bitcoin with USD, another wants to sell it for EUR) but they charge an extra fee specifically for the currency conversion and only match orders that are at different enough price points to cover that cost. Unless their bank is also limiting their ability to convert between foreign currencies, this shouldn\'t present a problem (and regardless, of that, running out of a currency implies insolvency whatever the reason for it).\n\nIf they\'ve run out of dollars then *they are insolvent*. By the very definition of the word, that they\'re unable to cover their obligations. Maybe it\'s only \'cashflow\' insolvency not \'balance sheet\' insolvency (i.e. they have sufficient assets to cover their obligations, but not in easy liquid form to cover immediately owing payments)... *doesn\'t fucking matter*, companies regularly go bust over cashflow issues when they can\'t pay their bills, even if they actually are "good for it" a month down the line. At the point where you\'re presented with a debt that you need to cover and you can\'t, that\'s grounds for the creditor to call in the administrators (at least, it is here... not sure about Japan, but I imagine there have similar laws about trading while insolvent).\n\nFact remains, if they\'ve run short of USD to pay withdrawals, that means that either their costs have outweighed their income over time (which seems somewhat unlikely given their volume) OR that they\'ve been trying to do something *other* than be a \'pure\' exchange - trading the market, investing elsewhere, whatever, and that they have subsequently failed in that venture and left themselves unable to pay out what they owe to account holders. In other words, insolvent. In other words, "should have stopped trading and gone into administration before they paddle any further up shit creek".\n\nIt\'s *possible* that they really do have every dollar they ought to, and are just getting shafted by their bank when it comes to the business of dispensing payments... which would imply that they\'re sat on huge cash reserves and a massive backlog of pending withdrawals that they can\'t clear any quicker than the bank lets them.

This way, your bot will take into account how volatile a time the price movement is moving within, if that makes sense. It'll keep your bot from taking action on outliers and erratic trading noise, which Bitcoin is very prone to.\n\nI don't know if this is helpful at all, but it appears to be [building an adaptive moving average for a coder's use.](http://www.anychart.com/products/stock/docs/users-guide/index.html?tech-ind-adaptive-moving-average.html) Here's [another explanation of AMA's calculation.](http://etfhq.com/blog/2011/11/07/adaptive-moving-average-ama-aka-kaufman-adaptive-moving-average-kama/)\n\nOut of curiosity, what are the two glaring weaknesses you mentioned?

I recommend at least having a volume momentum oscillator [like the PVO](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:percentage_volume_os) to better predict what the market sentiment is, even if the volume is relatively low. That'll at least help you determine if a cross is more or less likely to be long lived.\n\nIt might be worthwhile to have your bot calculate [moving average envelopes](http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_envel) or some type of bands to only take action on MA crosses that exceed a particular percentage out from the average line. You may miss some of those early shallow entry/exit points, but it'll eventually trigger a decision if that move turns out to be a real change. That gives the added benefit of the trader's favourite thing: some degree of minimized risk. The profits may be smaller, but so will the losses, and risky trades are reduced, ensuring that those smaller profits are better protected.\n\nAlongside those, make use of the divergence/convergence value if you aren't already. Again, this will help determine the market sentiment and will help your bot to buy in to uptrends rather than into sideways movement or those outliers.\n\nEDIT: Edited for specificity.": 4, 'So far it looks like it\'s doing a decent job of avoiding many sideways crosses, and definitely does a good job picking up on that massive dip. :)\n\nAs for a slower moving average, I believe all of the moving averages can be made "slower" or less responsive by increasing the number of intervals calculated into it. For example, you could make the SMA even more insensitive to price changes by using a 35 or 40 day calculation. Though I\'m not certain as to why you\'d be looking for a slower moving average with this setup. The SMA itself seems to be plenty slow enough at 30 days to avoid the noise and give you infrequent but solid crosses.': 2, '[[\xe2\x9c\x94](https://blockchain.info/tx/0f6b09fd1146f4e384d4a1e51983082ccb6603536e4527c73839c561d7dfe6e3)] **Verified**: [ClydeMachine](http://reddit.com/u/ClydeMachine) &#8594; **&#36;15.50 USD** *(m&#3647; 17.48725 millibitcoins)* &#8594; [cgs0541](http://reddit.com/u/cgs0541) [[**sign up!**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=bitcointip&subject=Sign%20Up&message=SIGN%20UP)] [[**what is this?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointip/comments/13iykn/bitcointip_documentation/)]': 3, '[[\xe2\x9c\x94](https://blockchain.info/tx/6849fae2e4814c9fdd667e07dfac7fb030ac6e434fcc19163bc78cab14efc2df)] **Verified**: [IamAlso_u_grahvity](http://reddit.com/u/IamAlso_u_grahvity) &#8594; **&#36;3.64 USD** *(m&#3647; 4.28284 millibitcoins)* &#8594; [ClydeMachine](http://reddit.com/u/ClydeMachine) [[**sign up!**](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=bitcointip&subject=Sign%20Up&message=SIGN%20UP)] [[**what is this?**](http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointip/comments/13iykn/bitcointip_documentation/)]': 2, "Hey I just got my Adaptive Moving Average calculator working.

First, it gives you two moving averages, and measures the distance between the two. It also gives you bars above and below 0 to better understand how much time is spent in a converging/diverging space. Third, it\'s a momentum indicator, meaning that you can better understand just how "fast" we are moving up or down in a trend - which can be a handy way of telling just how bubbly a bubble is.\n\n>*[Here\'s an example of the MACD alongside the last chart with two SMAs.](http://i.imgur.com/RDlz1Nk.png) This timeframe shows a very strong downward divergence on Jan 24th, which was further confirmed as a downtrend with the high volume bars on the main chart. As with the SMAs on the main chart, the MACD had a late crossover heading back up to the 0-value line, but had a healthy divergence value of ~2 after Jan 25th, with some volume support. The current variation in price on this chart is decreasing, shown by the convergence occurring right at the end of the MACD\'s EMAs.*\n\nMACD employs a shorter-term and longer-term Exponential Moving Average on the same chart, and provides us a quantified difference between them. The greater the difference between them, the faster the change in price. The longer that divergence stays, the more likely it is that the trend will last. Conversely, convergence (a reduction in difference between the shorter and longer moving averages) indicates slower price movement and often is associated with an ending trend. (This should sound familiar to what you read in the support and resistance post last week!) A value of zero in the divergence/convergence means the two averages are at the same value, and that a crossover has occurred. (Remember that this is a crossover between two moving averages, so it will be behind the actual trend. Factor this into your trading plan.)\n\nEmploy this indicator alongside other indicators to better verify those crossovers for maximum effect. Try it with support and resistance lines! Next week we\'ll look at the RSI, and possibly other indicators to add to your trading plan.\n\n\xe2\x80\x95\n\n# **In Closing**\n\nPardon the evening post today, had a weird week and needed some recovery time.

Russia issued a notice saying basically the same thing that China did in December: Bitcoin is not money and you are probably a money launderer or a terrorist if you\'re using it. Before this news, BTC-e was locked to Bitstamp. Since then, the spread has grown to average around $10-12.\n\n2. Bitfinex had already been using the Bitstamp order book for extra liquidity, but until now they were really separate order books and some people have had trouble dealing with that. They just combined them so all Bitstamp orders are routed through a fee calculation and then included as native Bitfinex transactions. These all use the Bitstamp exchange if possible, but they only appear on Bitfinex so people using Bitstamp only won\'t see them. This means there are lots of "hidden" orders in the book, that get eaten up on Bitstamp, adding liquidity, and seeing a tighter spread with less variance.\n\n3. BTCChina is back, in POG form! But now they are using a Maker-Taker fee structure, which in addition to confusing some bots for a while, also encourages a tighter spread with less variance.\n\nSo two other exchanges have tightened their spread and are responding less violently to market movements. There are also some huge walls on those exchanges that are pinning the price in a narrow channel.\n\nBTC-e has no such volatility reduction mechanisms in place, and there is potential bad news being reacted to. People are using BTC-e to test the available range of prices the market is willing to pay around 800, so they can make money off the swing.\n\nWhen BTC-e goes down an additional $10-15 relative to Stamp over an hour period, that suggests that between Bitfinex and Bitstamp there is enough depth to handle the volume of the arbitrage going on from the people who buy low on BTC-e without moving the Stamp price.\n\nIt\'s a similar pattern to what happened for most of the middle of January, but on a tighter variance. The added liquidity and reduced global volume is keeping the price pretty stable while people on BTC-e run their arbitrage.': 12, 'CampBX seems to be going the way of Gox.': 4, "Yes, the spread is closing relatively quickly.

Your explanation of why is as good as any I've read. If that is true, we may expect the spread to continue to close, so the liquid exchanges like Stamp may experience further rises, in the absence of any other market shifting influences.\n\nIf I was forced to speculate I'd say it smells like they don't have enough btc or fiat to satisfy all the withdrawal requests they have at any one time, so they're paying enough of them to prevent open rioting, but not enough to stop widespread unhappiness.": 6, 'I think what people need to realize is the price is only going to drop if more people are trying to sell than buy.

The rebound from that point was fairly rapid, bouncing back to the 740s and 50s.\n\nKeep in mind we are plotting these on Bitstamp time which is several hours ahead of EST where I am.\n\nToday, we are reversing back into a column of Xs because we have not broken yesterday\'s low of 725--and we\'ve climbed more than three boxes.  At this moment we are at 789.79.  The high for today has already hit 800.\n\nThe current "Buy Signal" remained the same. at $840.  The sell signal, for the next column of Os is at $710.  Keep in mind, if we reverse down past 725 today, the grey shaded area will become moot and we will stay in our column of Os from yesterday.  Confused yet?  [The grey boxes indicate the current status.  The actual status cannot be "confirmed" until the day is complete.  Then the grey shading is removed and the status is permanent.]\n\nSo, where do we go from here?\n\nMany of us were expecting a move.  I figured it would leak upward.  It dropped downward.  Shows what I know.  But, the interesting point is that with the reversal back up from 725, we retain the current formation.  It is now 11 columns wide.  That has only been exceeded once, and it went to 12.  While the move yesterday was what might be considered "fast, violent, or significant" we find ourselves right back where we were.  The "spring" or "tension" continues to build--indicating a still explosive movement to come.\n\nIs this a bull trap--moving upward, only to revert downward again?  Is this a result of folks moving out of Mt Gox into other exchanges? Is this the last gasp of the Chinese before the 1/31 deadline?  Who the hell knows.\n\nWhat I do know is this:  Volume was HUGE compared to the 7 DMA and the 30 DMA.  The move down was BIG, and the move back up is already BIG.  \n\nI am still cautious in announcing that we are going to skyrocket up.

No guarantee, don\'t risk more than you can comfortably afford to lose.\n\nAs for defense of the blockchain, you are correct in that the "good" miners would have to identify the "bad", and someone who really wants to destroy the blockchain would probably be smart enough to conceal this until they felt it was too late.  The problem with this approach, though, is that it only takes a single miner to sound the warning bell, and then whatever time it would take to investigate their claims.  Someone or some organization insidious enough to get more than 50% of the miners worldwide (to avoid the appearance of centralization) to collude, in secret, to subtly accept and verify bad blocks, or even good ones until that critical moment, without someone noticing and sounding that warning bell would be deserving of some healthy fear and respect.\n\nI think the blockchain, and indeed, money or people in general, would be beneath the notice of someone or some organization with that kind of power.

In the previous hearing, law enforcement officials came on and were the ones tackling the regulation questions.  They gave a positive outlook on the situation, and the Bitcoiners really didn\'t face as much questioning in terms of regulation.  Now, this isn\'t the fairest direct comparison; there were no law enforcement officials being questioned in the NY Hearings.\n\nHowever, now the Bitcoiners were having to answer really tough questions.  Questions they don\'t have an answer to, whether they admit it or not.  They are being asked how Bitcoin can be regulated to prevent money laundering and illicit activity.  They bring up past successful investigations by law enforcement, such as the Silk Road shutdown, but offer very little insight into how they themselves can combat these issues.  They\'re alluding to the notion that law enforcement just needs to continue investigating the bad guys, and they\'ll do their best to enforce KYC.\n\nUnfortunately, I don\'t think these answers were satisfactory to the panel.  Granted, they\'re nearly impossible to satisfy here, but to give the answer "you guys just need to keep working hard at finding the criminals" made me cringe a bit.  The government understands that it can expend a bunch of resources going after these guys, and if they invest enough into it, they should be able to find them.  But they\'re saying they want Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based businesses to make sites like Silk-Road more difficult / impossible to run.\n\nI would have said that there have been many advancements since Silk Road 1.0 was created.  Exchanges were not even requiring customers to verify their identities up until Q2 2013.  That\'s under 1 year ago.  Buying Bitcoin has become less anonymous everyday, and you will not find a notable exchange which provides service to US citizens without completing KYC verification.  Furthermore, the successful Silk Road raid has scared a vast majority of potential clients and sellers away from this type of marketplace.  We\'ve also seen many new illegal marketplaces shut down due to operators fleeing with users\' funds.  The confidence in the Dark Markets is very low right now.\n\nIf you look how far Bitcoin has come in just 2 years, where people could easily and without fear of repercussions trade contraband with BTC, to today, where only the most technology-savvy users can be confident at all in anonymity, and with the Dark Markets, it is night and day.  It\'s unfair to expect things to change overnight, but there have been obvious and major progressions over a fairly short time span.\n\nFurthermore, if the government refuses to accept crypto-currency and figure out a way to keep the average user happy, it will simply slip into the underworld.  There is no way for the government to shut these things down.  The criminals will find a way to continue on crypto with or without government approval of Bitcoin.  These are decentralized instruments, and by over-regulating them, you will just kill the currency and the criminals will operate with other derivatives of crypto.  By working with Bitcoin and Bitcoin businesses, you keep the volume in your playing field, where you can at least call some of the shots.\n\nAll in all I don\'t think this was the best showing for Bitcoin in general.  The cool new feeling of Bitcoin is wearing off and the government is starting to really focus in on the negative aspects (in their POV).  Realistically, I don\'t think we have an answer for these problems at the end of the day.  The government wants absolute control, they always want absolute control, and I think they\'re starting to realize that crypto is a step in the wrong direction in achieving this goal.  No one should be surprised.  The more popular Bitcoin gets, the more it\'s going to get hated by governments.  Bitcoin, at its roots, is designed specifically to exclude the need for authority.\n\nFinal side note, hilarious to see those Winklevoss leeches on the panel.  You can just see how scummy they truly are.  In nearly all questions they answer, all it looks like to me is them saying "please let my Bitcoins be worth more, please!"  These twinkle twins look like they\'d toss each other under the bus if it meant making a quick buck.  Some of these guys, I believe truly exist in the currency for the right reasons, but the twinkle twins only believe in a panned out pump and dump.  Who would expect anything else from them.

The *desire* to *control* the network definitely exists, for many players, even those (like governments and mega-corporations) who have the resources to pull it off.\n\nOne aspect of Satoshi\'s genius was in making that a very expensive and ultimately self-defeating prospect, however.  You would need more than 50% of the hashing power to force clients to accept your version of the blockchain.  That\'s the first step in giving yourself control.  Once in control, you need to maintain that without other, smaller miners complaining and suddenly rejecting your blocks in order to *remain* in control.\n\nYou spend X millions (or billions) to establish that initial control.  Now you need to continue that for the next 6 rounds of voting on the blockchain, with no miners realizing what you\'re doing and rejecting your blocks, to eventually pwn the blockchain and bring Bitcoin down (if that\'s your goal).\n\nWhile establishing that control, you\'re also being given block rewards and transaction fees.  The incentive is to not destroy your own earnings.\n\nIf the goal is to destroy the blockchain itself, and damn the earnings, then not only do you have to spend the money to establish control, but you have to continue to do so for as long as it takes to destroy faith in the blockchain and have it tank for the average user... a very, very expensive prospect, and to what benefit, especially if your motives and identity is discovered?': 0, "Yeah, I guess because I'm saying that on the whole, bitcoin is going to take some time to emerge.

It seems like this is going to be in the interest of at least one superpower, be it the US government, the Chinese government, hedgefunds, etc. As a value proposition, the amount of money gained from destabilizing the blockchain has to be greater than the amount spent on destabilizing it, and I think this is totally possible. We're talking about governments that sneeze billions of dollars, governments that don't audit $8 trillion of missing defense spending. Hedge funds that pay billions in fines and don't care.\n\nMy worry is that one of these entities will *think* it's in their best interest to kill Bitcoin, and will turn that into reality on a whim.

This problem is more insidious, not only because there is no easy (or maybe even feasible) solution to it, but also because the system could reach a point where transaction fees get so high that only the criminals are actually willing to pay to use it.  If it costs one dollar per transaction, nobody will be willing to pay that to buy bread or milk, but drug dealers will be happy to save so much moving money across international borders.\n\nI disagree with your assessment that hashing power is the biggest threat.

They do have some concerns for the possibility of illegal activity. \n\n11:46 -  Barry Silbert talking about his bitcoin investment fund "TheBit" and sounds like a "why bitcoin is pretty neat and why DFS should care" talk.\n\n11:49 - Jeremy Liew talking about why he thinks bitcoin is pretty neat. He wants to address why bitcoin can help our economy.\n\n11:54 (Jeremy Liew still) The most regulated part of bitcoin is payment processing, and as such we have bitpay and coinbase in the US. The most nebulously defined area is bitcoin exchanges and as such there are very few exchanges based in the US. \nConceptually I am for a "bit license" but I think that existing regulatory frameworks can be leveraged.\n\n11:56 - Fred Wilson, an investor, is talking about how the invention of the internet was really awesome and that bitcoin looks like it could provide the same kind of innovation. This is because it allows for borderless, peer to peer, completely open interactions.  We need to make sure not to over-regulate because it can stifle innovation.  AML type stuff is good but we shouldnt try to regulate HOW the system works.\n\n12:00 - Cameron Winklevoss starts making a statement -- \n\nAnd I have a meeting to attend. Be back in a few.\n\nBack at 12:09 and Jeremy Liew is talking now. He is talking about how bitcoin is becoming less about "people trying to get around the govt" and more about "people trying to leverage the unique properties of bitcoin to make good technology/investments/etc"\n\n12:10 - DFS is worried about bitcoin being all about people trying to hide their finances.\n\n12:11 - Jeremy Liew thinks that bitcoin has already reached the tipping point and now more people are looking to use bitcoin as frictionless payment system and as investment than as a hiding place.\n\n12:12 - Fred Wilson seems to be agreeing with Jeremy. He says bitcoin started as geeky crypto-libertarian toy. Then it went to the "vice" phase with the Silk Road.  The third stage is the "investment/speculation" phase which we are about to exit now. The next phase is the use of bitcoin as actual payment ssytem. Finally the 5th phase will be "programmable money". He thinks that the next mastercard and stock exchanges will be written using bitcoin. "I still think people will do dumb things but I think that the majority is no longer doing that".\n\n12:15 - Cameron Winklevoss says he thinks that the shutdown of the Silk Road and  the following price run up shows that people like bitcoin more now that it is "less shady".\n\n12:16 - DFS likes that bitcoin is a completely open ledger. Will we eventually get to having only 1 world currency or will it be multiple? Should we require/push people toward using virtual currencies that use public ledgers?\n\n12:18 - Winkelvoss twins talking about how we should not over-regulate or it could cause people to just try to create technologies that will get around stifling law. Fred Wilson agrees more or less.\n\n12:19 - DFS: Going forward the virtual currency world in order to succeed will need to embrace regulation. Would you say that regulation is inevitable and needed in order for currency to survive?\n\n12:20 - Barry Silbert says that bitcoin is global and that there are many countries that will each write their own regulation. He hopes that we create law that encourages the biggest bitcoin exchanges to be founded in the US/NY. He says that being said we should create law in a balanced way or people will take their business elsewhere.\n\nJeremy / Fred think that really the DFS should be creating clarity around their policy.

The bitcoin guys argue back that too much regulation will make people take their business overseas. But the DFS is worried about money laundering. DFS says that stopping money laundering is more important that not stifling innovation.\n\nMore general talk of how to create rules and how to enforce and how to help small companies stay compliant. \n\n12:40 - Fred Wilson: It is too complicated to do anything financial like opening bank accounts and sending money. Bitcoin could allow for a world where it is easier to do this which then passes the savings down to consumers.\n\n12:45 - DFS agrees that forms are annoying but as regulators we are trying to make sure that bad guys get caught. 9/11 could have been stopped by better regulation is what they are claiming.\n\n12:46 - Fred Wilson says that he created an identity with the TSA made crossing the border easy. If we could have a similar system where you "onboard" as a trusted banking customer. Then opening new accounts and doing other financial stuff is easy.  He doesn\'t want zero regulation but does think that there are ways to streamline.\n\n12:48 - Winklevoss says that a bitcoin ATM startup allows for better KYC using automated system than many standard systems. He thinks that an easy KYC setup allows people to get involved in bitcoin easier.\n\n12:49 - DFS talking about the silk road and how do we stop that? Do we want a world where you can simply and anonymously just log into a website and buy drugs?\n\nLiew says "We did stop it. Law enforcement shut down the website and caught the people involved using current regulation."\n\nDFS - Well, they caught them after the had already sold lots of drugs. How can we stop this from even starting to happen again?\n\nLiew - We haven\'t even stopped this problem in the cash world, there are still drug dealers selling in the US for cash. Silk Road about 6 months ago only related to < 0.5% of bitcoin transactions. This is not an out of control problem especially as we are seeing a change in the usage of bitcoin.\n\nWinklevoss - Bitcoin is terrible for criminals because everything is publicly traceable. Cash is actually anonymous. The market has spoken - people are demanding bitcoin and for the most part are not using it for illicit activity.\n\n12:54 - Talk about how to regulate mining.\n\nFred Wilson - Mining is a similar role to infrastructure providers on the internet for webpages. Miners both create money and clear transactions. Once all 21mil coins are mined they will simply be verifying transactions. They are the infrastructure that allows bitcoin to work. The point that Tyler (Winklevoss) made is that miners are pretty much large companies that run computer farms that run the infrastructure. Do we need to regulate Amazon in the world of running websites? I don\'t think that is really a regulatory issue.\n\nDFS - It seems that miners hold a lot of power. What if Dr. Evil wants to control bitcoin or corner the market via mining? If mining becomes too concentrated don\'t you know have economic infrastructure in the hands of just a few? Amazon doesn\'t seem to have this problem.\n\nFred Wilson - Amazon does actually control a huge percentage of the world\'s websites. Bitcoin has incentive to prevent that from happening to keep the system going.\n\nDFS - Mr Wilson, you believe that we are getting past the "speculation" phase. It looks like 50% of the bitcoin wealth is in around 1000 people\'s hands. How can we push into this "next phase"?\n\nFred Wilson - Need startups helping.\n\n----- missed a few minutes -----\n\n1:05 - DFS It strikes us that there are some apparent tension in the investment strategy that you are trying to bring to market and the notion of a payment system. Investment is about putting in money and holding it. Payment is about spending. How do you reconcile this?\n\nCameron Winklevoss - If people don\'t spend the money then bitcoin is less useful which would cause the value to go down. Investors are encouraged to use some of the money or they risk losing their investment.  Saving/holding is a self correcting problem.\n\nThe Winklevoss trust brings something to market - There are many exchanges with different values. There is no cohesive price point and there is lack of liquidity. An ETF allows for liquidity and price discovery which would be beneficial to the system.  We need more speculation in bitcoin to increase the value - this will attract inventors and new companies getting involved. We need more market cap in order to support a global payment processing system.\n\nTyler points out that bitcoin is divisible by quite a bit (although he says 100million parts which is wrong). This means that there is quite a bit of room for expansion.\n\n1:10 DFS - new topic. What do you think of how traditional banks are responding? Do you think that bitcoin will disrupt the banking system? For example it takes 3 days to pay my credit card bill with the same bank that I have my savings. That is crazy! Is there potential changes that bitcoin could bring about? How will that impact banks?\n\nBarry Silbert - Goes through the phases that bitcoin has been in the past. 2013 started the "investment/speculation" phase and he thinks that 2014 is the wall street movement into bitcoin. The future will be consumer adoption, but that requires more market cap than we have now.  New companies with new ideas will be how bitcoin reaches everyone.\n\nBanks today are multifaceted - some divisions/banks like the idea because it helps them. Some groups/banks make money off those 3 day payments and will need to change.\n\nJeremy Liew - Banks are interested with bitcoin companies but are worried about adverse regulatory effects from dealing with bitcoin/bitcoin companies. So they have decided to not do business with them. This is stifling innovation because it is hard to do business without a bank account.\n\nFred Wilson - The US doesn\'t have a big liquid exchange because of this. You need bank accounts to allow customers to move money.   Big companies respond to new techology like the 5 stages of grief. It seems like we are getting close to the acceptance phase now.\n\nCameron Winklevoss - It took years for the music industry to sort out what happened with iTunes. VoIP has been disrupting phone industry.  I understand why the banks are hesitant but I think bitcoin can help the banks. I jokingly take a philosophical view from Ghandi, first they ignore, then ridicule, then fight, then join you.  \n\n-- Missed a minute or two  and I have another work meeting in a few minutes.

I mean, Chase has quickpay, there\'s all sorts of quasi-services with similar mechanisms such as Square Cash or Flattr or what have you. But I agree that just the fact that Bitcoin is open source will mean that it will be far superior in the amount and quality of services that will be developed for it in the long run.\n\nI agree with some other posters... all of this seems cautiously optimistic with some undertones of "we need to prevent money laundering" which is almost comical to me considering the dollar is used often enough internationally for illegal purposes and yet they don\'t do anything to regulate that really. I mean HSBC can launder to mexican drug cartels and it\'s no big deal...': 4, 'Thank you for gold!

Mentions "a change in the character of people being involved in bitcoin". \n1st wave: "radical libertarians" attracted to open-source P2P nature\n2nd wave:  people attracted to "pseudonymity"\n3rd wave: people attracted to "freeish" and "programmable" functionality; \n3rd wave largest and represents biggest market. \n\n12:10: Lawsky asks if bitcoin is at a tipping point between criminality and mainstream functionality. \n\n12:11 Liew: Trend is very clear towards mainstream. Mentions his own investments and bitcoin foundation composition in support of his view. \n\n12:12: Wilson outlines five phases of bitcoin development \n1 - geeky, nerdy crypto beginnings (2009-2010)\n2 - vice phase: silk road, drug trafficking (2010-2011; "in rearview mirror")\n3 - price speculation (2013-2014)\n4 - transactional phase; real merchants making transactions (emerging)\n5 - programmable money; building new applications e.g. ticketmasters, stock exchanges on top of bitcoin protocol (future)\nmedia over-hypes vice phase. \n\n12:14: Lawsky agrees that the complaint from yesterday is "backward-looking"\n\n12:15: Winkelvoss: Complaint is "speedbump" \n\n12:15: Lawsky asks about "programmable phase"\n\n12:15: Lawsky: Will we see an emergence of a single virtual currency? Or will there always be multiple alternatives? Bitcoin\'s public ledger is a "very good thing for public transparency". Should we require public ledgers? \n\n12:16: Winkelvoss: Bitcoin has such a large headstart and could pivot to adopt innovations from other currencies. Public ledger is key to transparency.\n\n12:17: Winkelvoss #2: Danger to over-regulation of bitcoin specifically is that other non-public-ledger cryptos could overtake bitcoin. \n\n12:18: Wilson: Historically a single a protocol emerges, e.g. http, etc...  \n\n12:19: Lawsky final question: Do you think it\'s fair to say that going forward the virtual currency world needs to embrace regulation to thrive and succeed? Mentions libertarian community hating gov. \n\n12:20: Silbert: Bitcoin is a global phenomenon and we\'re seeing different regulatory frameworks in different countries. Hopes that dominant btc exchanges move to NYC. Regulators needs to recognize that the U.S. is essentially competing for hosting exchanges. \n\n12:21: Liew: Regulation here can pave the way for regulation in other countries. \n\n12:22: Wilson: New companies are very small companies and it would be difficult for them to comply with burdensome regulations. Asks regulators to be mindful of intrinsic startup limitations. \n\n12:23: Lawsky recognizes that regulations can drive small community banks out of business because they can\'t afford compliance officers. \n\n12:25: Wilson says community bank regulation should be a roadmap for bitcoin regulation. \n\n12:25: Wilson brings up music industry and music-listening experience companies. Claims that innovation is rewarded with regulatory lawsuits. \n\n12:28: Lawsky admits that money-transmitter rules were written 100\'s of years ago when time was of less importance. DFS needs to think about how to be a more modern, digital regulator.\n\n12:29: Wilson: Entrepreneurs don\'t want to notify DFS of their existence; argues for safe-harbor that lasts for around a year while the start-ups try to establish regulatory compliance. \n\n12:30: Lawsky asks whether the DFS could ask such start-ups for basic compliance with money-laundering protections, etc...? \n\n12:31: Other DFS guy: Shouldn\'t investors make sure companies are not involved in criminality? \n\n12:33: Wilson: Investors won\'t fund companies that can\'t get licensed; argues for everyone to understand everyone. \n\n12:34: Liew: Threatens to move bitcoin startups to countries or states with more permissive regulatory schemes. \n\n12:35: Lawsky: We will always squelch money-laundering in favor of fostering innovation; Can we find a balance where we\'re preventing laundering while also fostering innovation? \n\n12:36: Winkelvoss: We need a sheriff in this wild west. Likes idea of safe-harbor. Culture of start-ups doesn\'t allocate capital for regulatory compliance. Brings up idea of start-ups that deal solely with compliance issues. Wants regulation that allows companies to be licensed as "compliance-company". \n\n12:39: Wilson says outsourced compliance firms are a terrible idea. Thinks compliance should be "in code" instead of "heavyweight compliance infrastructure". \n\n12:42: Liew points out that there are thresholds to any regulation; e.g. can leave country with $9,999 undeclared cash. \n\n12:43: Everyone laughs about narco-trafficking. \n\n12:44: Silbert: Narrow focus about specific areas that need regulation. \n\n12:44: Winkelvoss 2: We need disruption and innovation coming "from the garage". \n\n12:45: Wilson complaining about how long it takes him to open bank accounts; argues that JP Morgan is an over-regulated company; poor Jamie Dimon. \n\n12:46: Lawsky brings up 9/11 and "people who want to kill everyone in the room". \n\n12:47: Wilson: Once you\'ve established yourself as a known and trusted banking customer you should be able to instantly open accounts, transfer money, etc... \n\n12:48: Winkelvoss: Bitcoin ATM company that takes palm prints, photographs, etc... to establish identity. \n\n12:49: Lawsky: Says that ATM example is interesting. Brings up complaint again; "a person could go in an exchange dollars for bitcoins and purchase narcotics through silk-road; How would you deal with that problem?" It\'s not worth having a digital currency if that\'s the world we\'re going to be living in. How do we prevent that? \n\n12:49: Liew: We did prevent it; silk road is gone. \n\n12:50: Lawsky: could it happen again today? \n\n12:50: Liew: Law enforcement has apprehended the person behind silk road and they "got those guys too" \n\n12:50: Lawsky: That\'s great that they got them; how do we put in guiderails that prevent that from repeating itself?\n\n12:51: Liew: We haven\'t eliminated drug-trafficking related to cash. I did research that showed that 6 months ago, about .5% of BTC transactions were related to buying drugs.  \n\n12:52: Winkelvoss: Cash is untraceable, bitcoin is not. Gateway companies are important to look at from regulatory standpoints. The bitcoin market shows that people demand bitcoin. \n\n12:53: DFS Woman (sorry didn\'t catch name): Asks Silberman about bitcoin miner regulation. \n\n12:54: Silbert: Can\'t imagine how BTC mining could be used for illicit activities; can\'t think of why miners should be regulated. \n\n12:54: Winkelvoss: Mining is possibly too global to regulate. \n\n12:55 Wilson: Miners are infrastructure for BTC. Explains briefly how mining works; miners "make bitcoin work". Miners are professional organizations; shouldn\'t be regulated. \n\n12:57: Other DFS Guy: Suppose an evil miner wants to get control of BTC infrastructure? How do we prevent that? Talking about 51% attack essentially. \n\n12:59: Winkelvoss points out that a miner taking control of the network would crash the value to 0 and that it\'s very expensive to do a "Dr. Evil attack"\n\n1:00: DFS Woman: About 1/2 of BTC owned by about 1,000 people. How do we get past this phase? \n\n1:00: Wilson: need to create transactional/merchant phase. There\'s nothing to do now other than to hoard it. There\'s a theoretical place where the price maxes out and stabilizes; no more appreciation in BTC. \n\n1:01: DFS Woman: Hoarding of BTC is antithetical to its real purpose as payment system. \n\n1:03: Wilson: Doesn\'t have an opinion on price appreciation. \n\n1:04: Lawsky: What will drive the reduction in price volatility? \n\n1:05: Wilson: liquidity; we need a US Based exchange; Wilson hopes Silberman does it. \n\n1:05: Silberman: U.S. exchanges have all been shut-down or failed. \n\n1:05: Other DFS guy: There is a tension between the dynamic of hoarding/saving and the need for liquidity. \n\n1:06: Winkelvoss: The utility of the network decreases if people hold and therefore the price lowers if people hold too much. Believes hoarding is a self-correcting problem. Starts advertising his ETF as source of "liquidity and price discovery". Need market-cap higher than $10 billion to absorb/support global payment system. \n\n1:09: Winkelvoss 2: Points out infinite divisibility as antidote to hoarding. \n\n1:10: Lawsky: Have you perceived how the traditional banking industry is reacting to bitcoin and the growth of virtual currency? Do you think bitcoin is a threat to traditional banking? Is it a disruptive force? Lawsky complains about the time it takes to pay his credit-card bill from his bank account account (three days, but all within the same bank)\n\n1:11: Silbert: This is the year (phase) of wall street; the next phase is the phase of mass consumer adoption. I could fill my schedule three times over with meetings with all the major banks. There are certain divisions that are incredibly excited about bitcoin; the divisions that have FX trading, commodity trading, wealth investment, banking service. Banks will have to incorporate bitcoin or rethink their business; it might affect top-line revenue but overall they should benefit by reduced costs. \n\n1:14: Liew: Banks worried about possible adverse regulatory affects; banks waiting for regulatory clarity. \n\n1:15: Wilson: Lacks of U.S. exchanges is due to lack of banking support. We need to see the banking system embrace bitcoin. \n\n1:16: Winkelvoss: Current banking industry is buggy and slow; technological solutions tend to emerge from outsider sources. Bitcoin can actually help banks, though I understand their skepticism. Brings up Gandhi: First they ignore you, then they fight you, etc... Dimon\'s comments in Davos belied his fundamental misunderstandings (ouch!). \n\n1:18: Winkelvoss 2: All of us are heavily staked, but there is a better world with bitcoin. Incumbent technocrats: their solution, they don\'t have one. We\'re working towards a solution but we\'re not sure if it\'s going to work. \n\n1:19: Winkelvoss: If you read through all of Satoshi\'s writing, he recognizes that bitcoin could appeal to certain ideologies but doesn\'t identify with any particular ideology. We are problem-solvers. It\'s a positive energy. The people that I see in the ecosystem are positive problem-solvers. \n\n1:20: Wilson: We\'ll see the banking industry come up with their own implementations of a virtual currency model that is more secure/safe/trusted. This will play out like compuserve, AOL, prodigy (fake internets that didn\'t survive). Fake bitcoins won\'t survive. \n\n1:20: DFS Woman: Why would those systems be fake internets? What if banks lower their transaction costs? \n\n1:21: Wilson: No one owns bitcoin; that\'s why it\'s better than a system that is owned by somebody. Nobody can build on top of JP Morgan Chase\'s bitcoin. \n\n1:21: Lawsky: We\'ve heard about the promises of bringing fees down with BTC. Many New Yorkers send remittances with 8-9% fees, if BTC can bring fees lower than 1%. Can BTC truly allow these kinds of remittances? \n\n1:23: Wilson: It\'s happening; doesn\'t know how big remittance sector of BTC is. Wouldn\'t surprise him if "it\'s five times the size of drugs". \n\n1:23: Liew: One of the big areas of promise. Need a market on the recipient side; need to change bitcoins into pesos or whatever. Trend is the friend of bitcoin beind used for remittances. \n\n1:24: Silbert: Global nature of bitcoin. Meetups, angel groups, etc.. are expanding. Reminds him of early internet days. This is the ultimate network effect. Facebook lacked a financial incentive. Millions of BTC users around the world are talking about bitcoin. Everybody gets it. \n\n1:25: Wilson admits he owns 150-200 bitcoins; smallest position on panel. His favorite thing to do is to give away bitcoin. It\'s amazing the feeling people get when they receive one. \n\n1:26: Winkelvoss: I always knew this would happen; I\'m excited it\'s here. Bitcoin was the next evolution. Western Union fees are unacceptable; people are getting clipped. You can send 50 cents to somebody in India with BTC; you can buy a NYT article for 8 cents. The promise is endless. \n\n1:27: Other DFS Guy: Is there support from the intellectual property community? Are there partenerships? \n\n1:28: Zynga has started to experiment with BTC; a major newspaper in Chicago is taking BTC. You\'re starting to see the first steps. \n\n1:28: Winkelvoss: Dynamic pricing impossible without BTC; people want to pay for content, there\'s just no good way to. \n\n1:30: Other DFS Guy: Asks very confusing question about establishing secure BTC banks. \n\n1:31: Silbert: 2 or 3 months from well-known banks coming out with clear BTC procedures. \n\n1:32: Lawsky: Brings up federal regulators, other state regulators, Chinese regulators, Russian regulators, Canadian regulators. How do you evaluate the international regulatory scene? \n\n1:33: Wilson: *joke* Anything that China bans you should invest in. This is about freedom. \n\n1:34: Lawsky: Should we look to any countries as models? \n\n1:34: Winkelvoss: Norway and Finland have been looking at it as a capital asset or commodity. That kind of treatment makes sense to me. \n\n1:34: Liew: Prefers clarity of specific regulation; uncertainty is paralyzing for small companies. \n\n1:35: Winkelvoss: New York can set the tone for the world. \n\n1:36: Winkelvoss 2: Bitcoin is American because it challenges incumbents. \n\n1:36: Lawsky: Thanks everyone for attending; says the panel was interesting; brings up likelihood of future hearings.

The only way to exchange fiat without a middle man is with cash, and transferring electronically requires heavily regulated middle men.  We probably already have the closest thing to a "decentralized, distributed bitcoin exchange" that we can practically build - craigslist/localbitcoins.  Cash is the only way you\'re trading fiat without a heavily regulated middle man (yes, I know localbitcoins does provide a middle man function, but the point is in-person transactions are the only type involving fiat where the middle man is optional).  No matter how "decentralized" your exchange is, if a critical component such as fiat transfers require middle men, then you still have a centralized weak point.\n\nCentralized exchanges are simply a necessary inconvenience for a world transitioning from traditional fiat currencies to true digital, decentralized money.

But I wont update the chart.\n\nI know, and you know, if it keeps going up it is unlikely to go down to $769.  \n\nBut the whole reason I like the chart is that it is SLOW.  It doesn\'t whipsaw you.  I would love to go a couple of days without adding a box.  That would mean price stability.\n\nI hope this helps.\n\nEdit...While I was typing this it hit $810...which matches the double top.  If we hit 820, we trigger a buy signal.  Goes to show you...': 5, 'On a five minute chart, that burst up was based on some decent volume.  Someone wanted in.

I can rent from a landlord, who has to replace the dishwasher when it fails, and who has to shovel the snow, and instead invest my money in stocks, which have outperformed real estate in most years.  And I have zero debt because I\'m not buried in a mortgage.\n\nStocks are great because they never lose money when the water heater explodes, never cause liability from people doing bad things on your property, never tie you down when you can make more money in a different city, and never suck up weekends in things like painting or fixing leaks.  I can instead devote my weekends to what I\'m doing now: creating a competitor to the middlecoin mining pool, which will teach me more useful skills than how to cut the grass.  You can also sell stocks at the market price to stop losses, while you may recognize the housing market is going downhill but you can\'t get the market price until the house sells three months later.  Stocks may not be as profitable as bitcoins, they they are certainly better than houses.\n\nIt seems to me that owning a house is a direct contradiction to what you argued, because houses are just a huge form of debt.\n\nAs to a funeral, I told my family to perform a direct cremation, which costs $800, and give the $10,000 that would otherwise have been spent to cancer research.  Funerals are a heartwrenching experience (and take a lot of time and gas) for people to attend.  The money could be better spent on the living.\n\nIt\'s good to see that you believe differently, but it\'s amazing that in this country that many talk about $75k as "adequate."  I think I spend about $22k.  I own a 9.2 speaker system with a 64" plasma TV, a cell phone that can do what people only dreamed of years ago, two exercise machines to serve as a gym, a reliable Civic, and have 900 square feet.  Something like 60% of my after-tax salary goes right to stocks and bitcoins.  What more could I want?  One could argue that a small house provides marginal benefits, but are marble countertops and a new Lexus going to make life better?\n\nAt my last job, the guy next to me made around $110k, and lived paycheck to paycheck.  He spent 30 minutes each day in an Excel spreadsheet budgeting how he was going to pay for his huge house and his new cars, and complained when the company delayed paychecks (but still paid the same amount) for a weekend because of a holiday.  Another guy bought $300 in huge hunting knives, even though he never hunted and he was afraid to display them in his house for being labeled as a murderer during house parties.  He said that they were just something he always wanted, so he had to buy them.\n\nWhen I make posts like this, people often give downvotes for being "rich."  I didn\'t become well-off because I made some multimillion dollar investment or even because I worked particularly hard.  Anyone can get rich, even people who work menial jobs.  The key is simply recognizing that the only resource that money can earn you is time, and the best way to get rich is simply to **not waste money**.\n\n---------------------\n\n*I edited this post to add that when you own a lot of stuff, your time gets eaten up in managing it and dealing with it.  The more expensive it is, the more time-consuming it is to maintain.  This applies even if you rent.

I don\'t have anything against anyone who has kids, but I often disagree when people make the assumption that "as you get older, you have more responsibilities."  Kids don\'t magically appear, and people don\'t get married by accident.  Those who choose to get married make a conscious choice to give up freedom for the benefits they see in marriage.  I find it amazing that 97% of people make that choice, given how everyone says they want to grow up so that they don\'t have people telling them what to do.\n\nHaving kids means giving up your entire life for them, in the time you have to spend to bring them up, and the years you have to work extra in order to earn the money to bring them up.

When last we spoke, we were in a column of Xs, peaking at $812.93.  Yesterday, we fell below into a column of Xs which has dropped as low as $770.70 this morning.  This is drop of half the column in size.  Our current reversal to a column of Xs is $800, and the next box down is the $760 box.\n\nThis change has made a couple of changes in the chart.  The first is that a potential "Buy Signal" has dropped to $820.  Our "reversal" price is now at $475.  I know that is still pretty far away, but we have moved up considerably as the formation has widened.  The "sell signal" remains at $710 and our "bearish objective" if we break the double bottom is $610.\n\nAfter strong volume on Monday (25,194) and Tuesday (20,042), it dropped way back down yesterday (7,044).  The price range yesterday was fairly limited as well.  The candlestick formation is not quite a doji, but it is pretty close.  Recall, that formation is a harbinger of change.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the top of this descending triangle is right along the path of the Bearish Resistance level (On the chart from $960, diagonally downward).  This is the resistance level from the recent high of $995.  We seem to be having a difficult time breaking through that level and moving upward.  This concerns me.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe end of the month is here.  It will certainly be interesting to see what happens over the Chinese New Year Festival.  We appear to be in a descending triangle.  The price decline is pretty slow--much slower than I would have expected.  One of the things I keep seeing are long tails on the candlesticks.  This is indicative of upward pressure--supporting the price.  Most drops down are met with pretty quick response, pushing the price back.  But, it seems that most breaks or longer periods of change are downward.\n\nI am not afraid of drastic drops.  I am concerned with "leaking" downward to the 720 double bottom price.\n\nI am also concerned with the drops in the stock markets lately, and the rise in gold over the past few days.  I wonder how many "traders" are going to get a margin call.  I wonder how many people, concerned that the stock market and emerging market problems are moving their free capital into gold and silver.\n\nI am going to keep an eye on the volume.  I personally moved some money out of the stock market into BTC and gold yesterday.  And\xe2\x80\xa6today they are both back down.  So, yeah\xe2\x80\xa6following me is a good idea!  But these are long term funds that would have gone into an IRA--except I think the government of the US has its eyes on my IRA contributions.  Yes\xe2\x80\xa6.I am paranoid.

About five of those years on average are spent in a state of increasing ailments and decline.\n\nIf the stock market continues to increase at its historical average of 7% per year, and I worked until 65, I would have something like $3m in "retirement" funds by that time.

I learned that I should count more on my real assets:  my house, land, etc. than I ever should in my investments--unless I was really "wealthy."

One uncle had a lien of $175,000 laid against his house--which the state will never collect because of the manner in which the deed was made 70 years ago.  These guys never made more than $30K in a year, and they had assets of about $300,000 cash/liquid.\n\nI would focus more on a ratio of your expected expenses.  2.5 million in assets will get you, at a meager return of 3% will get you $75k a year, before taxes.

The higher the haircut, the safer the loan is for a lender. The haircut and the LTV add up to 100%.\n\n>For example, United States Treasury bills, which are seen as fairly safe, might have a haircut of 10%, while for stock options, which are seen as highly risky, the haircut might be as high as 30%. In other words, a $1000 treasury bill will be accepted as collateral for a $900 loan, while a $1000 stock option might only allow a $700 loan.\n\n>Lower haircuts allow for more leverage.

I know it is awkward dealing with customers and investors in situations like this, but as owner and CEO of Mt. Gox it is your absolute responsibility to do so. Only you can head off the impending disaster. You need to start communicating with your customers immediately, and stay in touch on a daily basis even if you have nothing to report. Only you communicating can restore confidence. A blog or better a Twitter account would be perfect. Unless you do that, this will not end well. You need to standup and take charge before this gets out of hand.\n\nFinal thought: Right now you wouldn\'t want to meet me because I\'ve just taken a nasty hit on funds I left in a legacy account on your exchange while waiting for a resolution (yup, I just bought BTC at 17.9% above market). You cost me money that I worked hard for. Previous trading profits will easily cover this but others won\'t be so lucky. If we meet at a bitcoin conference there is going to be a very big argument because like many others I believe you have completely abdicated your managerial responsibility, which has made the situation far worse. If you let this volcano go off rather than manning up and dealing with what is happening as CEO, imagine how many other people there will be in the world you won\'t want to meet.

Here is some thinking on motives beyond incompetence. A few hours after this post appeared a ~500 BTC sell order at $970 popped up on Gox. I\'m wondering who would risk transferring that many BTC into Gox dollars given the situation unless they were an insider with a way to get them out somehow. My guess is that it was either a bitcoin baron seeking to dampen the market (very well done if so - rumors are they also helped Gox after they had funds seized) or that possibly it was Karpel\xc3\xa8s or a Karpel\xc3\xa8s associate. My reasoning for it being Karpel\xc3\xa8s or an associate is that if they think Gox is finished due to say regulatory issues - and Karpel\xc3\xa8s\' behavior is arguably consistent with his abandoning Gox - wouldn\'t he and his associates try and get out as profitably as possible? Certainly for example Gox should have built up a huge pile of bitcoin commissions. Wouldn\'t a captive audience of desperate BTC buyers being forced to pay an inflated price be a great way to liquidate that? Not only can they avoid depressing the market but they can get out at a massive premium.

It wasn't happening so I tried to talk to Gox to understand the situation re: $ withdrawals. Impossible... but by now my eye had been off the ball and I was looking at buying back into BTC at 17.9% off the money. It is a quagmire you can get sucked into quite easily. There will be plenty of people trading away, losing tons of money in fees to Gox, and not realizing that every time they trade out of BTC into $, and the price of BTC rises relative to the market while they are out, they are losing money. At some point everyone in $ may want to get back into BTC all at the same time. But the guys in BTC will be moving to other exchanges not going back into fiat on Gox. Will the last guy out be buying a $5000 bitcoin?

I'm sure they would be more than willing to pass the torch to able hands for the right price, especially if it means preserving the long-term value of bitcoin.

Well the fees on Gox used to be much thinner when there were market makers on the exchange that earned the lowest exchange rate of 0.2%.  Now however, the spread is 1% (used to be 0.4%, 0.2+0.2), which means no one is left on the exchange at that fee level to close that gap.  All the market makers are gone.
