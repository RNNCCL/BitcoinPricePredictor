Every Friday at 16:00 (UTC +8), in addition to weekly contract delivery, the monthly and quarterly contracts will undergo settlement.\n\nAlso, look at the tabs on the left page, noticed where it says "Deliveries", that\'s where it lists all the contracts that were delivered. Notice where it says "Settlement" on that page and see how it lists the quarterly contract as "Settlement". \n\nYou might want to go read up on OKCoin\'s faq. \n\nEdit: But yes, you are correct in that the futures contracts aren\'t really deliverable, but in the bitcoin industry none of them are and so delivery has a slightly different meaning. ': 4, 'Again, you can take definitions from different sources and apply to mean whatever you want. First of all, since OKCoin doesn\'t have daily "settlement", then it\'s not really "futures" in the reference that you used. For example:\n\nFrom Investopedia:\n\n>Example: Settling a Forward Contract\n\n>Let\'s return to our sailboat example from the first part of this section. Assume that at the end of 12 months you are a bit ambivalent about sailing. In this case, you could settle your forward contract with John in one of two ways:\n\n>Physical Delivery - John delivers that sailboat to you and you pay him $150,000, as agreed.\n\n>Cash Settlement - John sends you a check for $15,000 (The difference between your contract\'s purchase price of $150,000 and the sail boat\'s current market value of $165,000).\n\n>The same options are available if the current market price is lower than the forward contract\'s settlement price. If John\'s sailboat decreases in value to $135,000, you could simply pay John $15,000 to settle the contract, or you could pay him $150,000 and take physical possession of the boat. (You would still suffer a $15,000 loss when you sold the boat for the current price of $135,000.)\n\nSo you can either take the delivery or settle it in cash and that ends the position.\n\nAnyway, the point has been clarified now in the original post\n\n(note: forwards are futures, the only distinction officially is OTC vs. Exchange-based, they also say that Futures are "highly regulated" which isnt applicable in Bitcoin futures exchanges: http://www.investopedia.com/exam-guide/cfa-level-1/derivatives/futures-versus-forwards.asp )': 1, "Just because you trade this everyday doesn't make you an expert.

So every week Friday there is settlement/rebalancing, but there are longer-dated contracts like Quarterlies which don\'t settle every Friday (read: "deliver" or "expire" in other terms), but the Pnl is rebalanced still. \n\nEdit/Note: There is some terminology differences here to keep in mind. First: these are non-deliverable contracts. OKCoin incorrectly use the term "delivery" for their non-deliverable contracts. Settlement can mean different things in different contexts, some use it not to "settle out/close" contracts but to merely apply Pnl, other contexts use this to mean settling out the contract so it is closed. The point is that BiWeeklies and Quarterlies do not expire on the Weekly timeline, and your open positions are rebalanced every Friday on those horizons. Each contract itself is actually identified by the EXPIRATION DATE (so "Quarterlies" right now are really just December 25 contracts).\n\nThanks to /u/wudaokor for raising the above confusion\n\nLearn more about bitcoin futures with this guide at our website: http://www.bitcoinfuturesguide.com/futures-guide.html': 8, "You just described what settlement is and said it isn't settlement.

Now, since then, it has definitely shifted to bullish.\n\nSo the bear/bull description I believe does apply hear even though it\'s not the Nasdaq. \n\nThe problem a lot of people have here, is that if I say "We\'re clearly in a bull market", they point to a 10 point downswing and say "Look, you\'re full of shit!"

The targets are listed on the chart as between $390 (based on the three column count, added to the top of the break out point) and $400 which is counted by laying the last break out column on top of the current column.  That was an eleven box column, which ends us up at the $400-405 level.\n\nKeep in mind the Point and Figure chart \xe2\x80\x9cbuy and sell targets\xe2\x80\x9d are based on up to three months AFTER the trigger event.  Bitcoin usually moves a lot faster than your average stock, mainly due to 24 hour markets and a fairly thin market cap.\n\nI apologize if all of my talk of the formations got people thinking things would happen \xe2\x80\x9cat that point.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bitcoin has to battle through thousands of different people, each with different ideas and price points.  The price should continue to rise, based on the formation, but there is a ton of noise that you have to deal with as a day trader that are not shown in these charts.  Please plan accordingly.\n\nThe other point I want to make is that I will not be giving you advice on what to do with your money.  I made a couple of trades yesterday.  One made some decent money.  The other made $0.57.  Not exactly stellar returns because i sometimes let my emotions get the best of me too.  Following anyone on the internet is not a good idea.\n\nThat said, I am happy if folks make some educated trades, established entry and exit points based on the movements of these columns up and down.  The rise came a little before $370, but if you were watching (as I was waiting for the Pats to start and all through the Walking Dead) you saw a couple of hesitant moves, and then some decent pops.  I was please tho see it get into the $380s overnight.  I have to admit to being a little apprehensive about how closely some folks were watching this.  All told, it moved about $15 in a couple of hours.  You are not going to find too many stocks that will do that, except on earnings day for Amazon!\n\nSo here are the new price points:\n\nWe are climbing above the $370 price point.  If it goes up to $390, it becomes a long pole.  That is when you should watch to close short term trades on an apparent reversal.  It is possible that we would reverse down pretty quickly for a while at least 1/2 of the pole.  This happens pretty regularly with Bitcoin.\n\nOur current reversal point is $365.  Keep in mind that because we hit a new high box today, it will not reverse down officially until tomorrow at the earliest.  But if it turns under $365, you should be looking for a bull trap which would happen if it drops into a breakdown point in the $344.99 range. (Under $345.)\n\nOur trend reversal is currently at $325, and I think we are in pretty good shape not to turn around too quickly.\n\nSo, that is the update.  \n\nJust for yucks, you all should review this article from Forbes in 2013 about the "archetypal" bubble formation and overlay the most recent charts.  It is always good to be skeptical about where you are.  Surprises suck.\n\n*[Article from 12/2013 discussing bubbles](http://www.forbes.com/sites/jessecolombo/2013/12/19/bitcoin-may-be-following-this-classic-bubble-stages-chart/)*\n\nMy Patriots lost.  Our Gronkowski got injured.  And Tom Brady is banged up.  It is a sad Monday morning in New England.

During a financial crisis when the stock markets are dropping substantially, market participants try to dump as much of their speculative assets as possible to prevent further losses in their portfolio.  However, they don\'t simply move into straight cash.  Instead they seek out "safe haven" investments, which are typically the government backed debt on the largest countries by GDP.  The thought is that those government backed bonds are safe in the event of a larger stock market crash.  \n\nBasically, a bond is priced by taking the expected future interest payments and principal repayment and discounting them back at whatever the current applicable risk-free rate is (for government bonds) to arrive at a present value.  That present value is the amount of money you would have to invest today to generate the interest payments and principal repayment of the bonds in the future.\n\nHowever, the prices of those bonds are still determined by market demand.  In a crisis, people would be flooding to the bonds, creating increased demand, which would raise the price of a bond.  When a bond\'s price rises, it\'s yield decreases (and vice versa).  The influx of buyers for government bonds would quickly cause the nominal yields to move to a point where they were actually negative.  In essence, people would pay a price indicative of a 1% yield on a 3% coupon bond, which is a negative yield.  They are comfortable with the guaranteed 2% negative yield because they fear the stock markets could fall much further than 2%.

This causes a flight to risk, as riskier investments (all else held equal) generate higher returns to compensate for that cost (risk) you\'re carrying.\n\nZero interest rates also mean that money is "cheap." You can borrow it for free, basically. So people are borrowing a fuck ton of money, taking highly leveraged positions, and investing in risky markets to try to make a buck. This causes localized bubbles, of which 3 major ones are tech, PE, and real estate (varying by geography). I\'m sure there are more, biotech is a good guess, but I don\'t know that space.\n\nAnyway, bitcoin companies are probably the biggest sub market in that tech space. VC money is booming for bitcoin. So what happens when the economy finally enters a recession again and risk appetite dries up? For one, investment in the space will dry up, so dev and products will too. Secondly, bitcoin\'s price performance during a recession is untested. On one hand, you may see a flight away from it (as it\'s volatile and risky). Oversimplifies, the wealth effect argues that when you lose wealth, you dump your risky assets. Bitcoin is the first asset to be sold off to make money to secure positions in remaining assets. It\'s a demands side spiral.\n\nOn the other hand, bitcoin looks more and more similar to gold. It may actually draw investment - and if that\'s the case, the market for its derived products (the bitcoin startups and backing vc firms) will remain secure, using bitcoin to anchor the storm and generate growth. This doesn\'t event address remittance and blockchain use, which can cut operating costs in difficult times. So a recession might be the best thing to happen to the btc market, in the long run.\n\nOne thing is for sure - it will be very scary and very volatile.

The only way that BTC is a "safe haven" is if a major currency such as the USD, Yen, Yuan, etc suddenly collapsed.  People would flee that currency for other assets, and BTC might benefit from that somewhat as people utilize it to move assets unfettered from government controls.  The likelihood of a situation like that is small, and honestly I\'d be far more concerned about the global economy than BTC in that type of situation.

IMO the most important outcome would be that a solution would demonstrate that bitcoin can still be improved, and that it\'s possible to democratically alter a protocol even after it\'s been implemented by a large number of people.\n\nNow, with the block reward halving coming up in 2016, we could all argue over what the effect might be in a purely objective, emotionless society. Maybe none at all. Some people say it means less supply, so obviously unless demand decreases, prices should rise. And if the price doesn\'t change much, that seriously decreases the gross income of miners, so some might argue that price "must" increase.\n\nBut there is a lot of bitcoin in the pockets of holders like me, and if bitcoin rises much more, we\'re going to start using them more frequently. There are very few true holders, most of us have some price at which we\'re willing to spend away. So there\'s a source of bitcoin whose magnitude increases with the price, and which will dampen sudden upwards movements.\n\nBut if people believe the block reward halving will increase the price, then it probably will. Most of the price movements in bitcoin seem based on nothing more than emotion and I do not expect that to change for a while.\n\nSo I expect to see more bull market in 2016. And more bear markets, too, of course. They come in pairs. But overall I expect the bull markets to outweigh the bear markets.': 19, "Good call on when it'll end.

Since you are trying to calculate an ad hoc Sharpe ratio, you could use a historical yield-to-maturity of a US Treasury note of the same term at the start of the data.\n\nIf you are trying to calculate the Sharpe ratio for the entire time BTC price has been tracked, which appears to be 2010, you could use the 5-year yield-to-maturity on a US Treasury back sometime in 2010.\n\n[Here](http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/data.htm) is data from the federal reserve that tracks what is called constant-maturity yields. This is the yield on any term (1, 2, 5, 10, 30 year, etc) even if there is no US Treasury with the exact term. This can be done by interpolating the yield from other bonds surrounding the point in time. Thus, it is a way to look at historical data and find a yield for any term on any given date.\n\nA few things to note. Despite treasuries appearing to simply pay a fixed rate, that is just the coupon, and the actual yield on the asset moves daily as the price changes. So the point in time you pick will greatly affect the yield you will use for the risk-free rate. For example, in the month of November of 2010, 5-year yields ranged from a high of 1.55% to a low of 1.04%; a 51 bps change!\n\nThe other thing is that Sharpe ratios are a relative measure. As a stand alone figure, it does not provide much information. It is a tool used within the whole modern portfolio theory concept to help determine if adding an asset to a portfolio will improve its performance or not.\n\nHope this helps answer your question.\n\n': 2, 'The risk-free rate can just be an interest rate (might as well use 0) or you can use an index (if you\'re doing this to show investors, use the S&P 500, as stupid/unfair as that may seem). But really, as was said in that linked thread, the Sharpe itself is a meaningless number for a single asset -- it\'s really just a restatement of CAPM coefficients. The point is that there\'s no "correct" Sharpe ratio because in practice they\'re mostly just used to compare trading strategies. As long as you\'re consistent and your audience knows what you\'re doing, you can compute it however you want.\n\nIn addition, [this Andrew Lo paper](http://edge-fund.com/Lo02.pdf) is something to keep in mind in terms of the shape of your returns': 6, 'Thanks!': 2}, ('My Top 10 Bitcoin Traders to follow', 0): {'Great list flibbr and thank you for the link!': 2, 'Nope.': 24, "Hi Guys & Gals - cryptokeeper here... feel free to use this medium if you don't use twitter.

Thus, each rally establishes a higher support level in a way. \n- Just as there is no bad rally for bitcoin, there is perhaps not even bad publicity for bitcoin. Pretty much all publicity drives further awareness and brings one way or the other more people in. Did any publicity prevented the rise of bittorrent - or achieved to kill it? Each story about piratebay brought more people to the platform. \n- So... there is no way to stop bitcoin just as there is no way to stop bittorrent - except for trying to attack it from the inside such as [hiring a bunch of XT suckers](http://bravenewcoin.com/news/30-top-banks-and-mike-hearn-have-now-joined-r3-global-consortium/).

That is always going to be infuriating to users.\n\nI agree 100%, and we're doing everything we can to mitigate those issues, part of that is our migration to websockets (we should be moving this from beta to prod within the next 2-3 weeks). \n\n>Lately you can't even place an order sometimes when the market is moving.

This does not constitute tax advice and is general information.\n\nThe biggest thing is constancy in method.  Don\'t switch it up from year to year.  \n\nI would say that you should use FIFO per wallet.  If you have old coins in cold storage they are segregated and not disposed.  This is analogous to my holding GOOG stock in two different accounts with two different brokers.  If I sell my shares with one broker I do not consider the order of the shares in the other account.  The use of a method like FIFO is figure out *which* items that are comingled are disposed of.  Since each wallet is separate they are not comingled. Your other wallet is *clearly* still holding those coins.  FIFO within a comingled "account"/wallet.\n\nAs I said, the key is once you adopt a method to use it going forward.

(think of a 61 day window, 30 days before, the sale date, and 30 days after)  In a wash sale the loss is disallowed.\n\nLets see an example.  We are in December and I hold a stock, XYZ.  My basis in XYZ is greater than the fair market value.  I bought the stock at $40 a share and it is currently trading at $20.  I have lots of capital gains for the year. I like the stock and I want to hold it going forward.  i decide to sell my shares at a loss and "harvest" the loss.  At the time i sell those shares, assume I own no shares, I repurchase my position.  A wash sale occurs when I repurchase my position. \n\nWhen a wash sale occurs you do not get to deduct the loss.  Instead the loss adjusts the basis of the reacquired shares, so it is delayed until those shares are sold.  My XYZ stock, I sold it for $20 with a basis of $40 at a loss of $20 per share.  Since I have a wash sale, my basis in the new shares was $20 and I reduce them by my $20 wash sale so my new basis is $0 per share ($20 purchase less $20 wash sale).      \n\nRefresh, a wash sale can only happen on a capital asset sold at a loss.  It happens when you acquire a similar position either 30 days before or after the sale at a loss.\n\nIn the context of Bitcoin.  Suppose I mine coins or I buy them on the regular.  If i sell some at a loss I might fall into a wash sale. Wash sales can happen even between accounts, brokers, or investment managers.  I have spent hundreds of hours early in my career looking over loss transactions for inadvertent wash sales for clients.  Fund manager 1 sells shares at a loss and fund manager 2 buys similar shares within the window.  \n\nSo back to FIFO, LIFO, and Average Cost.  When a wash sale occurs, you adjust the basis of the new position for the disallowed loss.  This can happen between wallets and accounts (again only loss transactions can be wash sales).  You would adjust the basis of the new assets (in which ever wallet they go into) by the disallowed wash sale.  ': 2, 'What about the wash sale rule?

Not sure how to answer it other than briefly stating my overall thought on efficient markets:  A given investment market will be as efficient as it can possibly be, but there are usually limitations to keep it from being fully efficient.  So while we know of the upcoming halving and therefore understand that supply production will be constrained, there are so many other factors involved in how the halving will effect the price that we can't be sure of what the overall effect will actually be.  We have to make a lot of assumptions just to be able to even create a scenario to analyze (are miners selling every coin into the open market once they are seasoned? Are they selling them off market? What if some miners sell 25% of their rewards and others sell 60%?), so the analysis can be flawed from the beginning because of the assumptions made.\n\n>My point is I don't think it's simple, and I don't know what percentage of the driver for the price right now is trading speculation, though I suspect it's a lot of it.\n\nExactly.  We really don't know.  So speculating that the halving is going to have a dramatic effect on the price is just that... speculation.

The value of gold is mostly found in it's malleability (to make jewelry), it's perceived rarity and it's shine. Price is always a function of supply and demand. Whether one puts more value on the utility of the infrastructure of bitcoin or the ability to turn something heavy and shiny into a bracelet, the fact is, 1 bitcoin is much rarer than 1 ounce of gold. No one is saying they are equal, what I'm pointing out is a market inefficiency which is illustrated by the difference in the ratio between the price of 1 bitcoin and it's supply when compared to the price of gold and it's supply. They are arbitrary measures: I could have used a satoshi vs a gram, for instance and the ratio would be the same (although someone could probably do a better estimate and get a more accurate number than 267:1). \n\nEdit:\n\nIn other words, one might also say that the demand for gold is 267X greater than the demand for Bitcoin.

Said another way, market participants already know that the number of Bitcoins is capped, and this fact helps determine the current price per Bitcoin. If people thought that coin generation was going to continue at current rates, the price wouldn\'t be what it is. There will be effects on the numbers coins miners can sell as well, but again the same sorts of arguments apply to the overall market including miners. These kinds of arguments stem from the efficient market hypothesis, and although the Bitcoin market is not completely efficient, this is important background knowledge for any investing decision. Ignoring the efficient market hypothesis can lead to all kinds of delusional investing ideas of the form: "event x that everyone knows about is coming up, therefore I can easily buy now and make a significant profit when event x occurs!"

It is about 267X more scarce, meaning that if gold is $1000, the expected value of bitcoin should be $267,000. \n\nThis is not my prediction for only a year from now, however, these $10,000 numbers, which everyone seems to think is wildly off, are not really that far off from where we will likely find stabilization in the next couple of years. Eventually, bitcoin, if it continues to expand it's infrastructure, will reach over 50k, provided it remains in one of the top 5 digital currencies. This price point might be a over decade from now or longer. \n\nBut over the course of the next year, it will dip in January, but I doubt it will go lower than $275.

If Bitcoin was $12 at the last halving, do you think the halving was already "priced in?" IF so, why wasn\'t the price much higher in the run up to it?\n\nUgh, yeah, because the price 6 months before the halving was about $5.  If you know that an asset will have its supply constrained at a pretty set date in the future (It\'s not set in stone but easy to ballpark), and it\'s logical to expect that the price would increase to match up the new lower supply amounts with the same demand amounts, then people are going to purchase the asset in advance because they expect the price increase.  This is basic stuff.  \n\nWhen you simply pick a pricepoint from the past and compare it against a price point in the future, that tells us nothing.  It gives us no information other than what the price was at those two points in time.  It does not explain why the prices moved that way or give any indication of the many underlying factors.  It doesn\'t even tell you what the price has done at other points in time during the interim.\n\nMarkets price in future events as far out as they begin to think about them.

You\'re talking about two very different worlds.  I would hazard to guess that 75% (or more) of the current bitcoin users were not even involved in bitcoin at that time.  Just looking at BitStamp data, 2012 didn\'t see a weekly candle with more than about 30k of BTC traded at the max.  There\'s not been a single weekly candle with volume lower than 40K BTC since the beginning of 2013, and we regularly see volume amounts over 100K, and a high of 385K.  These might as well be two different "eras" of bitcoin.  This upcoming halving will see the daily BTC rewards drop from 3,600 to 1,800 per day.  3,600 BTC is not a lot of BTC for the market to absorb, and that\'s assuming that miners are selling 100% of everything they mine directly back into the open markets (which is not realistic).': 6, "Hey that's me, sweeet.

The exchange takes the risk.  This leads to draconian margin call policies (read: margin call early and often to reduce risk for the exchange) and low leverage, and has the risk of the exchange going out of business if there is a fast move, in which case all customer funds are at risk.  It's very unattractive to exchange companies as well.\n\n1. The losers take the risk.  This means that there can be no anonymous trading, and if there is a fast move and you get margin called, the exchange sends lawyers after you and you could end up with debts so large they destroy your life, just for taking a modest highly leveraged position before a huge move.  This would make KYC policies very intrusive and trading a gamble with large hidden stakes for the customers.  It would also take a lot of resources from the exchanges budget for legal processes.\n\n1. The winners take the risk.  If there are systemic losses due to margin calls that don't get filled, the losses are deducted from the profits, and the winners get less money (they won't lose money though).  This costs nothing for the exchange (just software development time for a problem that had to be coded in some way anyway) and allows anonymous trading with high leverage for customers, with the only funds at risk being what is deposited at the exchange.\n\nGiven that high leverage allows a good trade to produce ridiculous profits, the third alternative clearly seems to have the least serious drawbacks to everyone.\n\n*Edit: Typos*": 19, "Because using strawman arguments always makes you look foolish -- there is a sweet spot for leverage to volatility -- I think between 10-50x depending what market conditions are at that specific time -- this is all highly subjective to each individual.

I guess if you aren't one that likes choice and options then there is no argument to be had\n\n>It is effectively gambling anyways...\n\nAll trading has an element of gambling to it -- the only people that go around saying it isn't gambling are those that have something to prove to themselves, friends, family, spouses that they aren't in fact degenerate gamblers": 2, "When we started BitMEX (2014 and early 2015), our system was option 1. We guaranteed settlement (and still do) on the XBU series.\n\nWhen we moved to higher leverage, we considered all risk management options and ran simulations of each. For example:\n\n* We tried a price capping system that would prevent settlement with loss (similar in some ways to auto deleveraging). This was like a dynamic limit up / limit down. For example, if a user would go bankrupt above 300, the future would not be allowed to execute above 300 until that user was exited. This worked well to prevent loss, but it had a downside: in a directional market, the price could get 'stuck' at a cap. The only way to unstick it was to fill a liquidation, but nobody would be willing to take the price.\n\n* We simulated automatic deleveraging for some time. We found that:\n\n1. The usability/messaging is very difficult; how do you communicate to a user what is happening, why it is happening, and why they were the one selected? Even if you tell them, how do they verify this?\n\n2. Automatic deleveraging is good for the exchange. It has the following benefits:\n\n  1. No published loss ratio - good optics\n  1. Deleveraged users are forced to re-leverage at market, creating more volume/fees  \n  1. The illusion of fairness (only users with open positions are getting closed, so a position opened/closed during calm times is safe)\n\n3. Unfortunately, automatic deleveraging is worse for the user: \n\n  1. Every time you are deleveraged, if you want to keep your position, you have to immediately re-enter, crossing the spread and incurring another fee. \n  1. You have to babysit your position to do this. While you should (of course) be watching highly leveraged positions, deleveraging creates a lot of additional work for the trader.\n  2. Losses are realized immediately. Imagine a market that moves sharply and retraces. In many cases, a socialized loss/DPE system will be able to fill pending liquidations on the retrace and get system loss back down to 0. Otherwise, further liquidations in the period may bring the loss down. In a deleveraging market, the lost profit is realized immediately via the forced exit and the opportunity is lost.\n\n* We chose DPE, because we knew we could do it better:\n\n1. We could publish real-time rates, which no other exchange does.\n2. In combination with our unique [mark pricing system](https://www.bitmex.com/app/dynamicProfitEqualisation#fair-price-marking), DPE is a completely different animal in comparison to other exchanges' socialized loss systems. We can avoid unnecessary liquidations in highly leveraged markets, not only when the future's basis swings, but also when it is illiquid. \n  * Manipulation in a mark pricing system is much more difficult; you must manipulate the underlying index ([XBX](https://tradeblock.com/markets/index/) on our Bitcoin markets), not just the exchange you're trading on. This allows us to try new types of markets without worrying that moments of illiquidity will lead to unnecessary liquidations.\n  * Liquidation cascades (like the BFX flash crash) are not possible; liquidations don't affect the mark price, making the market safer for everyone.\n3. Our system is fast, serial, and atomic; this means the matching and clearing are done in order. The book can't get out of date with matching, it can't cross, and margin is allocated to your account immediately upon any price movement. You'll never see a situation where orders are matching but your balance doesn't update properly, or positions don't update, and so on. This means we are able to place liquidations in the market incredibly fast, helping reduce the loss risk.\n\n---\n\nIs there a perfect system? Probably not. Because we can't choose option 2 (going after users for bankruptcies), highly leveraged Bitcoin markets seem to offer unlimited upside reward and limited downside risk. Obviously that can't be true, so there are compromises. Our goal is to make the compromise automatic (e.g. you don't have to babysit automatic deleveraging), transparent (we publish live DPE percentages and soon will publish more on the insurance fund / buffer), and fair. That's why we do DPE.": 17, "It's pretty impressive they haven't had any socialized losses yet.

We have a system that aggresses the order into the market at intervals given market conditions, to attempt to get the best price for the order. If the system is able to do that, the leftover funds are put into a pool (insurance fund). \n\nWhen the market moves very quickly, the system is unable to get a good price for the order and a loss occurs.\n\nAt this time we are not publishing the fund status, but given the demand, we will be working to expose an API for this and other liquidation data. Like on other exchanges, that fund is used to offset losses, which is why you've seen exactly 0% DPE on every settlement before today.\n\nBy definition, the realtime DPE% displayed on the site includes offset from the insurance fund. That means that if you see any DPE%, the total losses are higher than the insurance.\n\nAt the time of 24H opening yesterday, the insurance fund was low. There has been some chop in the markets the last weeks, causing some unhealthy liquidations, but they were offset by some liquidations that were able to be closed before bankruptcy. If you were watching the DPE%, it was up and down as the market moved and retraced. Had it retraced fully, we would have seen it go back to zero.\n\nKeep in mind that this is 100x trading on a market that moved like this:\n\n[XBT24H Dec 11](http://www.tradingview.com/x/Z7BJbN50)\n\nThat said, our mark pricing system has, to date, done an incredible job of preventing losses from both liquidations and manipulation.

In a world of inefficient capital investment due to free money, where corporations are buying their own stocks to inflate value and everyone is in a flight to risk assets to generate a return with other people's money in a ZIRP environment, the problem is low interest rates and the solution is to increase them.\n\nIt's an oversimplification to say hike = bad, low = good. \n\nI absolutely expect indexes to tumble and capital to be repositioned with a short or mid-term correction that will be painful, but that's the whole point. Money is in ass-backwards places right now and valuations are higher than they should be. So i would say that it is a good thing to experience some negative growth. \n\nThen, primarily on the bond front, what would a hike in interest rates do? Capital should come flooding into the US market from foreign investment. People pile into USD already at ZIRP just because it's safe. Imagine now that us bills actually generated a return as well as being safe! While the rest of the world is devaluing hand over fist and charging YOU (negative interest rates or not, certainly negative at real, risk adjusted rates) just to park your money in their bonds. US t bills will become a golden egg. \n\nThe equity environment would also become far more attractive after a cool-down because the investing environment would be a far more stable and long-term focused.

An not a minute too soon.  \n\nJust kidding.\n\nIt seems that the more I stay away, the better we do.\n\nSo, since last we communicated, the price has jumped, pulled back, and jumped again.   \n\nToday we are in a column of Xs with a recent high of $425 the other day.  That point represented four boxes above the break out point.  If you remember, the four box above the break out point is called the Long Pole Warning.  As soon as you are four boxes above the break out point (if you are a \xe2\x80\x9ctrader\xe2\x80\x9d) you should look for a pull back at least halfway down the column.  This column of Xs is 9 boxes high, therefore look for four to five boxes of a pull back.  That puts us back at the break out number of $405/$410.\n\nI know if you are watching this thing like a hawk you know its already dropped to $411 for the day.  (on CoinBase.)  As you can see on the chart, if we were to mark up today\xe2\x80\x99s movement as of this moment, we would have already reversed into a column of Os.  (See the red shaded column on the chart.  That does not become \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d until the end of the day.)\n\nSo, I am not telling you anything you do not know, and I am not suggesting I am some kind of Bitcoin Nostradamus.  I point it out so that you may recognize the formations in the future and make the smart plays.\n\nSo, since we are currently in a break out, recall there are two ways to project the extent of the movement.  The first is to count the columns since the last breakout.  In this case we are three columns wide.  Add that count, in boxes, above the break out box.  Therefore the projection from counting widths is $420.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve already hit that.\n\nThe second method is to overlay the previous break out column.  That would be the previous column of Xs (it is not always that column\xe2\x80\x94so beware of that when trying this at home.)  That column was 12 boxes high.  When we overlay that column onto our current column (starting at the bottom) we would count 12 boxes up from $385.  That brings us up to the $440 range.\n\nThis is the point where you have to use some common sense and judgement.  We slugged it out to get to $400 and then it popped it up to $425 and we\xe2\x80\x99ve pulled back.  My common sense look at this does not think we are getting to $440 on this go around.  We have already met the width projection and started to come back to earth a bit.  \n\nThe Negative break down point is anything under $375.\n\nMy prediction is that I think we will drop to the $405-$415 level for a few days, go into a short column of Os and then the chart says we start up again.  When THAT happens, I think we will see the $440 range.\n\nTrend reversal is now at any price under $350.\n\nSo, I am back from New Mexico.  I love it out there.  I love the food and the people.  The landscape is breath taking.  When I go back, I am going to ride the motorcycle again and spend more time investigating the Rio Grande Gorge area and the Kit Carson National Forest.\n\nI watched Breaking Bad all the way out, so I drove around ABQ just a little bit to see the area.  \n\nAll in all a fun trip.  Coming back against the time and getting up early sucked.\n\n\n**[Chart of the Day](http://i.imgur.com/V4vf209)**\n\nEdit:  if you were to go back to the high at $502 (or so) and draw a resistance line down the chart (as you would if we reversed trends) and you will see the line go right across the current position.  So there is going to be "mad resistance" getting through the $425-430 range.

So to start, the ask side of all orderbooks would be completely wiped out.  At the top of those orderbooks are probably lots of "wishful thinking" asks, just hoping for some fat-fingered whale to miss-enter an order.  So I\'d initially expect to see some wild price ticks several thousands of dollars higher than the current price.  But those ticks would be a poor representation of where supply would meet demand, because supply would effectively be gone until more sellers can bring liquidity into the market.  \n\nThe second phase would feature everybody else who holds bitcoin in cold storage or secured somewhere off an exchange.  These are the people who would bring the remaining liquidity to market in order to meet the remainder of the 1.2M bid.  Many of these longer term hodlers would be willing to sell a large portion of their stash after seeing the price if bitcoin presumably spike to thousands of dollars per coin.  It\'d be a rush to the exchanges to cash in, but I still suspect every new bid would easily be absorbed for quite some time so long as the 1.2M buyer stays serious about getting his order filled at any price.  I\'d expect (relatively) smoother trading ranges while this happens, but still many thousands of dollars per coin and probably still rising.  \n\nHow long the second phase lasts would depend on what happens next.  If it is taking days, weeks, or even months for that 1.2M bid to be filled, the buying pressure never subsides and the price is constantly going up, expect a wave of FOMO from non-bitcoiners looking to get in on the profits.  This could start introducing unprecedented levels of demand for bitcoin, separate from the 1.2M whale buyer.    Who knows how high the price could spike?  5 figures maybe?\n\nThe final phase would be the 1.2M bid finally being filled and the buying pressure to subside.  Shortly after everybody notices the price has ceased going up, everybody would get the idea to lock in some of those profits, and the orderbook would flip to heavy sell pressure.  A correction crash would come, probably dropping the price back to maybe 10-50% of it\'s peak.

": 1, "So a somewhat similar precedent to this happened in crypto land in February 2015 when the well-known poster from BCT, 'Otoh', put in a massive 100k Darkcoin buy-wall using his Bitcoin stash across a couple exchanges.\n\nHe kept it in place for the most part and only occasionally raised it little by little. And what ended up happening was you would have many dumb trader people trying to front-run his buy order with their relatively puny orders, as well as many people (miners) happily selling in bulk into it. \n\nEventually the Darkcoin ('Dash') community became knowledgeable that this order belonged to Otoh and the sell orders subsided at which point he had to raise the bid over and over and over and he basically pumped the coin up alone throughout February. \n\nWhen his buy finally ran out the price kind of meandered around, didn't crash though. \n\nBased on that I think a 1.2 million coin buy across multiple exchanges would definitely lead to some insanity and probably one of humanities biggest bubbles ever. Looking at Bitstamp, BTC-e and Bitfinex order books now you could gobble up 12k coins now and the price would rocket to the 490's. So with only 1% of the buy order done the price is up 6.5% instantly. \nBased on that same linear math (gobbling 12k coins makes price increase 6.5%), you would finally have 1.2 million coins bought with the price at $255,000 per 1 BTC.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't a linear equation. Humans have a tendency of turning things into bubbles and becoming quite illogical when there is free, guaranteed money to be had...so obviously the '12k coins per 6.5% price increase' ratio would pretty quickly get watered down because who in their right mind would sell when there are some monolithic buy orders sitting there. \n\nSo more than likely you'd see a parabolic effect occur whereby 12k coins no longer causes a 6.5% increase but rather 12k coins causes a 10% increase then the next 12k coins causes a 14% increase then a 20% increase then a 27% increase, etc etc etc. So pretty quickly you'd see the price double and quadruple instantly just to get another 12k supply.\n\nEventually though the price would get so high and stupid and irrational/illogical (millions of dollars per BTC) that either the buyer would run out of money well before reaching 1.2 million coins OR you would see a massive emotional exit from everyone here on reddit and on BCT who own any amount of BTC's. Why? Because none of us is going to NOT sell our BTC if given the chance to payoff our mortgages/cars/student loans/retire at age 20, etc. So I bet you'd see that mental top at about $500k to $1 million per 1 BTC price.\nSorry for the long-winded answer.

I think that it is easy to see that the average price of 10 market orders of 1 BTC each (triggering at the same moment) is worse than the average price of a single market order of 1 BTC because of slippage. Therefore, minimizing the chance of collisions with other market orders/stop losses will improve your average price.

I think that if we factor in that market depth and spread varies over time, this is quite obviously not true. During periods of high volatility, the slippage will be larger than during periods of low volatility. Similar effects exist for the bid-ask spread.\n\n\nJust to be clear, my initial assertion was that stop losses are mathematically worse than randomly placed limit orders.

REST API has some broken parameters (like "since" on kline).  REST API sometimes randomly decides to return large sets of unknown javascript code instead of regular JSON.  Here\'s a big one - Websocket API HAS NO OPTION FOR SUBMITTING AN IDENTIFIER WITH AN ORDER SO YOU CAN EASILY IDENTIFY IT WHEN YOU GET A RESPONSE.  That one makes figuring out which order is which an absolute nightmare when your\'e sending multiple orders at a time.  No option to attach stop losses to order or trailing stops.  No option for fill-or-kill.  No options to set good-till-cancelled trade expiration times.  No one-cancels-all type orders. \n\nI spent so many hours writing code to add some of these things in.  But I think I\'m done with it.  The disconnects are just killing me, especially when I\'ve sent an order, get disconnected before I get the response, then am left with no good way of figuring out what happened to my order.\n\nEDIT: I will mention that I briefly played with Cryptsy\'s and BTC-e\'s APIs a little a couple years ago but never tried to do anything complex.  I\'ve taken a brief look at Coinbase\'s API too, but I suspect the lower volume & taker fees would make it a non-starter for me.': 1, "Yup, you read my mind.  I learned about Forex after learning better ways to do technical analysis.  \n\nEnd game is to work both markets via automated trading.  Since Forex works on a similar style (currency pairs) the trading and TA are very similar. Just bitcoin tends to be a lot more volatile which is good for PnD traders.  \n\nNot familiar with commodity trading will have to look into it, but as of right now this is a hobby so don't want to over extend myself though my bot is relatively solid (2 years old).  \n\nOne rule I'd like to express is to not be greedy :)  I *almost* always work with 1 BTC at a time.  Once I've traded up to 1 BTC or a little over I withdrawal 80% of it into cold storage, then work my way back up. \n\nI've found this helps limit risk.  There was 2 times I did get the itch to be greedy and went all out and it was right before Mintpal went belly up.  Knew there was a nice pump about to happen with dogecoin so deposited ~2.5 BTC hoping to double up.  Then mintpal went to hell and I lost everything.  \n\nThat's a big reason I put that rule into place though I did break it a month ago as by now I do have a modest amount of trust in cryptsy.  Once I made my profit though I quickly withdrew and back to trading 0.2 BTC.\n\n": 2}, ('Grappling with math: Capital gains tax and short term BTC trading.', 19): {"I'm just gonna put all my purchases at 0$ since I can't prove what I bought them at.
