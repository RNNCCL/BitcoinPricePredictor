It is definitely possible to do, but it's at the limits of current technology. The problem with zerocoin was that it would be too intensive on the infrastructure. There's a new approach being worked on as we speak (who knows if we can get enough traction though - I doubt it tbh).\n\nThere's a couple problems with cash. One is that it's high-risk to store. If you put it in the bank, you're no longer anonymous because there is a record tied directly to your dox of deposits and withdrawals. So that leaves storing it at home. Even the highest quality safe doesn't come close to the security of btc.\n\nThe second problem with cash is that you either have to deal face to face (which can pose its own risks, and is certainly inconvenient) or risk sending it through the mail (which of course has all sorts of risks - including possible loss of anonymity).

You send me the widget and approve the transaction (1 of 3).\nCase 1: I receive the widget and it\'s as described. I approve the transaction (2 of 3), and the btc goes to your wallet. The end. The escrow cannot block the transaction or interfere in any way. Transaction over.\nCase 2: I receive the widget and am not satisfied. We try to settle our differences, but cannot. Then the escrow makes a determination. If the escrow determines you are in the right, it approves the transaction (2 of 3), and you get the btc. I can\'t stop it. The escrow can\'t take the money.

You start it off with a few seed forumals, like EMA crossings, Stoch RSI, etc.\n\nThen you write a program that interprets this markup, runs the calculations against historical price data, and scores each calculation in terms of how well performed (which itself might be a challenge). In the next iterations the ones with the best scores continue on, while the ones with the worst scores are deleted, and new mutations are created to replace the deleted equations.

What is true is that if China has banned bitcoin-related bank accounts, then this is good news unless you are blinded short-term by greed.  Here's why:\n\nFirst, and least importantly, from a simple market perspective, the two biggest uncertainties were Mt Gox and China.  Now, both of them will be gone.  Instability hurts markets.  The price of bitcoins will be able to stabilize once both of those issues are gone, increasing uptake from retailers.\n\nSecond, bitcoins are still going to take over in China, just as they are going to everywhere.  You can't ban bitcoins in any one country, because they will thrive elsewhere.  If they are banned in any particular place, then people will start holding them underground until eventually enough people hold them that they become the de-facto currency.  People in many countries store suitcases of dollars under their beds even though it is illegal to hold dollars, because the benefit of retaining their savings in an inflating economy is worth it to them.  It will just take longer for that to happen.\n\nThird, the innovation in bitcoins isn't occurring in China.  There aren't any $15 million Series A funding announcements for bitcoin startups in Beijing.  Those startups are in the United States for a reason.\n\nFinally, and most importantly, we need to step back and look at the big picture.  During the last period of Chinese bad news, I reminded everyone that the Chinese are *evil*.  I think I need to repeat that reminder.  China is a country where they bring tanks into a square to clear out protests, where they censor the Internet with a firewall, and where people are thrown in jail for blog posts.\n\nI don't know about you, but I support democracy, even the imperfect one that we have.  I support the ability to choose how one lives and the ability for people to live their lives in religious freedom.  I have no doubt that bitcoins are going to change the world, and I also have no doubt that once the Chinese kick out all bitcoin-related businesses, they will end up with a lower standard of living once other countries take all the profits.  I want these profits to be in the hands of good people, not in the hands of bad people.  Money is power, as the Russians are finding out with sanctions mounting against them.\n\nPutin is one of the richest people in the history of the world.  Xi Jinping and Putin remain in power largely because they have lots of money.  When they run out of money to pay their cronies, people get angry and rise up against them.\n\nIf you look past the short-term effect on price, you see that these rumors, if true, are a good thing for the world.

It dipped for a day, everyone remembered that nothing else changed and moved on.\n\nAnyways, my position is hold for the long term, buy some more whenever it dips down.

Notwithstanding that this could be a noob not realizing that the ticker price isn\'t what you get when you sell, this was someone who would have known that to get the best price they should at least wait a little while to see if any buy support built up before dumping. And possibly instead of dumping they might create numerous small sell orders people could chomp through and digest (unless they were concerned someone else would dump).\n\nMost likely, these were actually competing whales who are long and short trying to send the price in opposite directions.

I had more fun and genuine engagement over the last year with the Bitcoin community than I have had with basically anything else in my life during that time. It\'s funny, I knew I was facing a $250k+ loss the other day, but I was so excited about the few hundred dollars I made on N&B, lol. The totals are just numbers on the screen.

I considered near-100% losses as a result of my own market decisions. I did not consider 100% losses as a result of trading on the oldest BTC exchange in existence, and so my fatal flaw was a catastrophic underestimation of my counterparty risk, plain and simple. I made the best decisions I could make at the time, with the information and personal experience that I had to reference in making them. I accept the decisions that have been made. Again, there is certainly a lot of blame to go around, but I respect myself too much to wholly blame anybody else for what was ultimately my decision.

But follow along, and it will make sense.\n\nWe reverse up yesterday into a column of Xs.  We hit a high of $592 in the afternoon and dropped back down overnight.  For those of you that got in under or at $570, you enjoyed a quick $15-20.  That formed the column of Xs that are to the right of the current column of Os.\n\nThe formation today is a reversal down from the $590 box to the $560 box, hitting a low sometime this morning of $568.86.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve bounced back since then.  **IF** we continue back up and exceed $600 then everything will revert back to the chart from yesterday, with the column adding a box at $600.  That is why today\xe2\x80\x99s column is shaded in grey.  It will not be confirmed until today is over.\n\nIf today\xe2\x80\x99s chart stands, we move the numbers over.  Our new negative breakdown comes at the $530 box.  The same place we\xe2\x80\x99ve bounced off a lot in the past.  The positive breakout number goes to $600.  This is down $20 from the last one.  The indicates that the resistance line is coming down and if we can break through, it should be clear sailing for a few boxes up into the $600\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nOf concern is the fast approaching support, or trend reversal line, at below $465.  This is up from the last formation and we are quickly approaching that point where the trend reversal might be imminent.  We are not there yet, but it could happen in the next week or so.  Keep an eye on that line during any drop.\n\nSo what does this mean?  I liked the movement yesterday.  We reversed the long pole down nicely and started another formation.  The key numbers for this formation are moving up towards $600 and down towards the $530 box.  I doubt we see either today.  But who knows, there might be someone out there with 1000 bit coins that wants to have some fun moving things around.\n\nRemember:  This is not financial advice, or trading advice.  It is simply the reading of a point and figure chart.  Make any trading decisions on your own.  Using internet chart analysis to base a decision all by itself is a dangerous thing to do.  \n\nPS:  If you see a mistake in any of the labels, just drop me a note and I will correct them.  Sometimes I do not catch all of the labels correctly.\n\nPPS:  I want to plug /u/bitcion here as well.  If you scroll down today\'s thread you will see a post he made where he pretty much called the top and bottom yesterday.

When we cannot be sure of synchronization or an error is detected, the system falls back to "semi-synchronized" state and uses another system (the same as RBTC and Wisdom do currently).\n\nOur ability to synchronize with the general event feed is what allows us to show updates, esp. updates deep inside the order book, before other people. \n\nUpdates to the order book are then forwarded from our servers to clients in web browsers using a proprietary differential protocol that we will use for all the different exchanges i.e. only our servers see the unique APIs of the exchanges. The differential updates are pushed over a web socket.\n\nRegarding Huobi API being a disaster - frankly speaking, all the exchange tech I have examined in detail so far is shockingly bad when you get down to the details (although I haven\'t examined Huobi yet and it might be different). A lot of these exchanges were cobbled together quickly to capitalize on the opportunity last year. Over this year I think we will see much more sophisticated exchange tech becoming more prevelant.\n\n\n\n': 1, 'We can do that easily.

You need positive momentum to push the price forwards when there is strong negative book pressure and vice versa. Typically book pressure greater than +/-500 is considered significant force when price isn\'t moving much and no overbearing historical momentum.  \n\n**Coloring.**\n\nGenerally speaking the text of orders less than 5BTC are greyed to help distinguish where the order weight is. Currently if a buy order is greater than 25BTC it gets green coloring. If a sell order is greater than 25BTC it gets orange coloring. If a sell order is greater than 100BTC it gets red coloring.

I means that we continue to consolidate in this $30-$40 dollar range.   No news, not much volume, just a little fluttering.\n\nIf you were able to get into the low $540s or $550s, good for you.  You were able to clip a couple of dollars.  \n\nThere are a couple of boxes to watch:  The first is the $530 block. If we drop into that, look for a pretty significant bounce back to the $560-70 range.  As I have indicated on the chart with the closed in lines, we\xe2\x80\x99ve bounced off of there several times since February.  But watch out.  If you go below the $530 box, it should drop pretty far, pretty fast.  The next resistance is in the $455 range.  Be on your game if you see that happening.\n\nThe second box to watch is the $570 box.  This means we are popping up in the other direction.  In the past when we break through it is good for four or five boxes in pretty short order.  Again, be prepared for the bull trap, but in the past this has been a decent indicator.\n\nSo, watch, keep your fiat handy, and be ready to pounce.  Or just buy and hold.

For instance: it looks like the bars are just showing price in excess of $500 or something similar.  \n* The pie-chart for volume comparison might be superfluous, see my next point.\n* The entire thing would be easier to use and take up a lot less space on the screen if you condensed "Last", "High", "Low", "Bid/Ask", "Volume" and Volatility into a single table.  \n* The name "chartfactory" might not be suitable for something that doesn\'t allow the user to actually build charts.   \n\nI realize that you broke things down into modules in order to take advantage of the bootstrap grid/flow for mobile users, but IMO this has created a major discontinuity in the relationships among your data members.  The d3 pie charts and dial gauges look sweet but actually add to the discontinuity because they can\'t reasonably be rendered in the same grid as the bars.\n\nBy the way, I would be interested to hear your experiences with Angular.  I have been trying to choose between Angular and Ember for a current project but am having a hard time pulling the trigger on a framework.  I have used Knockout and Backbone in the past but wasn\'t happy with the d3 integration.  It seems like at the end of the day d3 is competing with all of these other frameworks for DOM manipulation which leads down the road to some pretty painful integration points.  In the past I have ended up just binding Knockout directly to the SVG and then used some low level d3 functions for scaling and animation features... but then you loose the reactive nature of d3... but I digress.\n\nAt any rate, I hope this came across as constructive.

You say very clearly yourself that this requires cold-hearted logic and discipline. You need to apply the technique, crunch the numbers, and leave emotion out of it. \n\nThis sounds *exactly* like the kind of job computers would crush humans at. Computers are extremely good at mathematical tasks and are not bothered by irrationality and emotions *at all*. So anyone good at programming and statistics should be capable of writing a script that utilizes one or several TA techniques, and subsequently calculate whether the TA \'worked\' (performed better than what you\'d expect by pure chance). But this proof does not exist? Nobody has ever done this and nobody will ever be willing to do this?!\n\nOkay, let\'s say that computers can\'t do TA for some reason. Perhaps it\'s like poker, which is still too complex for computers to solve at this point. Then it would *still* be trivially easy to test the effectiveness of humans using TA and whether they perform better than you\'d expect by chance. This is not like trying to prove the effectiveness of a palmreading session. This is a technique that allows you to make decisions that have clear, quantified outcomes. This is made to be tested mathematically/statistically. Since TA allows you to make decisions frequently - sometimes even multiple times per day? - you can have a nice sample of decisions and their resulting winnings and losses, so that you\'d have a signficant result within days, weeks or at most, months.\n\nYet, this evidence doesn\'t exist? It has never been tested?\n\nIf it is true that it has never been tested, then some TA-users can band together, make all their trading decisions 100% transparent, someone good at statistics keeps score, and in a few weeks we\'ll have proof whether TA works.

The exchange only needs to hold BTC, it does not need to touch the fiat.  The fiat simply is transferred directly between buyer and seller.  The exchange can be set up to escrow the BTC during the fund transfer.  Even by taking a 0.2% fee on the BTC, these exchanges will be more profitable in BTC buy/sell than Huobi / OKCoin.\n\nBecause the exchange does not touch the CNY, it can be hosted off-shore, meaning the Chinese government will not be able to shut it down.  Online bank transfer / Alipay in China are perfect funds transfer services for this type of exchange.  They are quick, simple, cheap, and chargeback-free.  \n\nThis type of exchange may not replace Huobi / OKCoin, but it is MILES more advanced and user-friendly than Localbitcoins.  This is the next frontier in the China Bitcoin world.  The exchange is completely resilient against government, there is no centralized point to shut down.  Once a user in China has BTC, this BTC can be transferred to other exchanges to be traded in real-time.  When a user wishes to cash out, they will then use the decentralized Chinese exchange.\n\nThis type of exchange will become a worldwide model in decentralization, which is ultimately the final frontier of Bitcoin.  China will ultimately need to restrict all types of person-to-person fund transfer within the country to stop the Bitcoin exchanges, which is a huge challenge.\n\nEDIT: For those who are unfamiliar with Alipay - let me give a brief overview.  When you sign up, you provide your ID number, and link it to your Chinese bank account.  From there, you can add / withdraw funds to your Alipay account.  Every Alipay member receives an Alipay account number.  To log in and send money with Alipay, users are subject to security methods such as 2 Factor Authentication (similar to BTC exchanges).\n\nOnce you are logged in, you can send money instantly to other members on Alipay.  All you need to send money to another Alipay user is their Alipay number.  Money is sent instantly, and it is irreversible.  It is withdrawn to your bank account within 24 hours.

At around the same time he and the treasury secretary forced the heads of the largest banks and the US to accept hundreds of billions of dollars they didn\'t want.  (I know, crazy, huh?)  For an encore, he printed up on the order of 16 trillion USD for his banker buddies, a fair amount of which got stashed offshore.  Nice win for everyone.  Now the FED\'s tapering its spending (printing) -- buying fewer assets every month -- by a bitcoin market-cap and a half every month, and the whole world\'s getting bearish.  Yellen said the two words "six months" off-the-cuff a few weeks ago and the stock market flash-crashed.    \n\nPrevious FED chairpersons did everything from stop backing every treasury note with gold for US citizens, take us off the gold standard altogether, bumble through the depression, fix stagflation (but looky there, the median wage has stagnated ever since, hmmm)... \n\nIn contrast, the chair of the PBOC has more power relative to the Chinese banks and the economy, less relative to his superiors (Congress tries to tell Yellin what to do, mostly with grandstanding on CSPAN/CNBC), and absolutely much more security and far better call screeners and appointment setters.\n\nThen there\'s the little bit about the entire (illusory) Bitcoin market cap being smaller than a gnat on the list of ways the chairman\'s superiors are channelling capital out of China around the capital controls.   You\'d be lucky to get an appointment with a bank branch president, something I\'d be willing to bet is the real reason the exchanges aren\'t hearing anything.  No one will talk to them, they\'re just not important.  \n\nBut hey, we all gotta start small, right?  \n\nNever fear, though, Chinese money will find its way into any bubble.  Also, the PBOC has been widening the USD-RMB daily trading band steadily, and within 3 years will have effectively stopped controlling it altogether.   There won\'t be much need for capital controls on the average Yang Liu at that point, so look for a loosening there in 5, or at the most 10 years.  ': 10, "Why the hell wouldn't you run your miners?

I suspect that in the long-term, merchants cashing out will simply stabilize the price instead of pushing it up or down as the same quantity of bitcoins that are sold needs to be bought.

In general those that have are older, and get SS and Medic and those that don't have get free stuff. In general, they all vote with their pocketbook. So it should be no surprise how this will play out. The fat, the lazy, the dumb, the unskilled, the sick, and the old inherit the earth. All others are enslaved. All others are shamed for having the temerity to state the facts.\n\nIn depressions, there is price discovery. You find out the real un-levered price of stuff as debt is repudiated. Failing managers go bankrupt and the pieces are redistributed to the quick, the smart, the skilled, the healthy, and the young. Failures must reconcile where they went wrong and pledge their lot with the new management.\n\nThat will never happen. The current lot of failures will go to any length to protect the status quo. They will never admit that collectivism in a vacuum is bad. They will never admit that progressivism for the sake of progress itself is but tyranny by any other name.\n\nAll the while the role of the dollar reserve must go unchecked by any means necessary. Here price discovery is never permitted. Monetary metals held the only hope, but with paper pricing in futures and the hypothecation and limitless rehypothecation, the price of gold is what ever they say it is. The price of silver the same so long as we are in this slo to no growth regieme. And slo to no growth is fine for the powers that be.\n\nFor those that do not understand what I am saying, just look at the wealth accumulating at the top since 2008. Slo to no growth is good for thems that have. And the door into the club is shut for thems that don't, because the price of everything is too damn high relative to income. Today you are made to slave where yesterday a salary could sustain a whole family - buy a house, a car, groceries, savings and frivolity.\n\nIn closing, should the powers that be lose control of dollar hegemony, you will want something other than dollars and debt. Gold and silver may achieve a much higher price in dollar terms. FOFA suggests $50K gold. Silver may get to $900 (SBSS). And Bitcoin while untested as gold 2.0, clearly provides the investor safe haven from dollar hegemony.\n\nBut let me be clear, when they lose control, price discovery will be small potatoes compared to the truth and reconciliation of collectivism and progressivism. Where once families took care of their own before the nanny state, good people will have to step back in and take care of their own once again. This will wipe out most everyone's savings wether they be in dollars, gold, or BTC. And still loved ones will die. People will be mad as hell. And for generations, great shame will fall upon those who have the temerity to suggest we collectivise for the benefit of failures.

I never disagreed with this - quite the opposite.  Let me give you an example that may help illustrate my point.\n\nI decided to buy bitcoin in early January because long term (1+ year), I expect the price to rise.  Short term, (3-4 months) I had no clue what the hell it was going to do.  I thought there was a good chance it could fall since we were close to the last bubble, but I didn't want to risk not being in the market at all (since I was watching that crazy post bubble bounce from 350 back up to 900).  This is *exactly* the scenario you want to DCA in.  It limits your exposure to risk in a volatile market.\n\nSo, I planned out when to make my investment over three months and just last week bought the last of my planned expenditure @ $470.  I didn't do a strict DCA because I tried to use short term trends to plan out the timing of my purchase each week.  I'm some cases I did this wisely, in others poorly.  I'm guessing overall, my efforts to time the DCA made no significant difference in my basis.  If I had lump summed, I'd be holding bitcoin with a basis of about $820.  Instead, I'm holding more with a basis of $650.  There is no doubt DCA was the smart play in my situation (although a far smarter one would have been to wait #hindsight).\n\nSo yes.  In most cases, DCA is not the best way to make an investment from a pure ROI standpoint.  However, it is a FANTASTIC way to limit your risk in an volatile market as my example proves.\n\nWhere I wanted clarification is on this point.

Why?  Because to stay above that trend line for any length of time is to imply a rate of growth that is simply inconceivable.  It just never happens in any context whatsoever.\n\nNow - when I make an investment decision - I want to know what the reality is out there in the world. And when I investigate  the state of bitcoin adoption, I look at two basic things.  News and price.  News has been a mixture of bad and good.  China news in particular doesn't phase me because it is an essentially a speculative market - no signficant investment in consumer infrastructure seems to have been invested (like coinbase etc).  Merchant adoption there is insignificant.  It's just the removal of a purely speculative market, not an adoptive market.  The tax decision is the biggest problem.  But in essence it's solvable with tech.  Beyond that - the metrics are still positive:  http://www.bitcoinpulse.com/ - I see nothing out there particularly that should make me think that adoption has stalled significantly.  \n\nNow - price is an indicator about the state of Bitcoin as well.  Price tells you about the demand for Bitcoin - so it's reasonable to think that price tells us something about adoption.  And it does - but only if you know what you are doing.  You might think that a massive drop in price such as we've had is a strong indicator that the state of bitcoin is worsening.  In some contexts you'd be right - but that's where my 'perspective' comes in.  I'm not saying the drop is not enormous.  I'm saying that the drop cannot be interpreted as indicative of actual adoption - and I am saying this because as I've shown, its previous price implied a rate of growth that was impossible to sustain.  It had to come down no matter what the news was.\n\nNow that the price is down to a sub-trend level - we at least don't have a positive reason to disregard it as an adoption indicator (besides the general craziness of this market).  So when I look at both the news and the price - I see no reason to think that Bitcoin adoption has stalled.\n\nNow - does that mean I can say I know with confidence that the current news won't send the price lower?  Of course not.  This market be crazy.  But personally I am not fretting about the state of bitcoins beyond the usual worry of it being completely nuts to start with.  But we all knew that one - didn't we?\n\n\n": 6, "g...reat analysis on OP's part": 3, "Most of the pessimism is due to fundamentals.

Something odd is going on around the -0.2 to -0.1 mark.  Another spike occurs lower down and then it just cuts off hard instead of trailing off like it does at the other end.

Not necessarily something you want to rush to put your life savings in if it looks like the sky is falling.\n\nGiven this, the immediate reaction would likely be a sharp decline in the exchange price, possibly even widespread exchange market collapses given the lack of solid/liquid professional exchanges. At the very least there would be a fuckload of volatility.\n\nIn the months after the initial 'shock', I can well envision just the opposite for Bitcoin. In fact it might just be the best thing to ever happen for Bitcoin.\n\nIf the Bitcoin network proves reliable (transactions process normally, governments unable to cease funds, merchants able to receive payment without delay, etc). The once 'risky' asset/payment network will have proven itself in the eyes of many people in a time of stress and uncertainty.\n\nSimilar to 2008 it is also likely that many people will find themselves dissatisfied with how the government/banking institutions will handle the crisis. The anger and distrust that created the 'Occupy Wall street' movement could easily direct many people towards Bitcoin, either as a form of protest against 'the system', or simply as a practical alternative.\n\nOne would also expect in the months/years after the initial crises that the pressure to 'inflate the problem away' will be strong. This will incentivize individuals to hold less fiat (especially true if bail-ins become prevalent).

It does not predict future direction but shows trends. This indicator uses two (or more) moving averages, a slower moving average and a faster moving average. The faster moving average is a short term moving average. For end-of-day stock markets, for example, it may be 5, 10 or 25 day period while the slower moving average is medium or long term moving average (e.g. 50, 100 or 200 day period). A short term moving average is __faster__ because it only considers prices over short period of time and is thus more reactive to daily price changes. On the other hand, a long term moving average is deemed __slower__ as it encapsulates prices over a longer period and is more lethargic. However, it tends to smoothen out price noises which are often reflected in short term moving averages.\n\n>====\n\n>[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/dqkAVxv.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Moving_average_crossover.png) - *Moving average crossover of a 15-day exponential close-price MA \\(red\\) crossing over a 50-day exponential close-price MA \\(yellow\\).*\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Moving ^average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) ^| [^Finite ^impulse ^response](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_impulse_response) ^| [^Technical ^analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_analysis) ^| [^KST ^oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KST_oscillator) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cgnxalv) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cgnxalv)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)': 1, "The last time we had an uptrend period that was at least as long as this one (we're at ~5.5 days now) was from March 8-18.

While it is possible that the attacker could save data between you and the site, they would have to be in control of a router that sits between you and the site to obtain that data.  Hackers in Russia are unlikely to have access to the lines or routers between you and Bitstamp.  Even if they do, so much data flows through these lines that they would need supercomputers to be able to inspect packets at the rate the data is flowing.\n\nSince they are unlikely to be able to intercept data, it is also unlikely that they will be able to do anything to you even if they steal the site\'s private key.\n\nA more likely scenario is that someone logs into their own account, and the site runs a query that returns the credentials for many accounts into memory.  Hibernate, for example, creates a "query cache," so that the disk doesn\'t need to be read if a common query is repeated over and over.  The attacker then exploits the bug to retrieve the contents of memory in the server.  The memory contents contain information, such as users\' bank account numbers, which would never have been sent over the Internet otherwise.\n\nIf you are paranoid about this bug, then the correct course of action is to log in as soon as possible and transfer your money.  Since you don\'t know how the system works internally, it could already be storing your credentials in memory that is exposed to attackers even if you don\'t log in.

Thanks for challenging me.\n\nWhen I talk about trend - I'm talking about the current rate of growth in price as indicated by this regression line (i've added in some fake data simulating a crash):\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/6vYRLFt.png\n\nWhen I talk about the trend breaking - I'm talking about a serious deviation from this trend - as in THIS line.  I'm not talking about later regressions that might include lots of lower daily prices.\n\nNow it doesn't matter at all when this trend breaks.  If it breaks tomorrow, or in a 100 years something must have changed. Either the market has changed its mind (because it thinks it has made a mistake), or something about bitcoin itself has changed and the market is adapting to the new reality.  So a break in trend tomorrow doesn't necessarily imply the market has changed its mind (with respect to its belief in THIS trend), it might just be, for example, that a fatal exploit gets discovered tomorrow that nobody knew about.\n\nBut there is another level on which to think about this which I was conflating in my comment above.  What I was thinking about was a narrative that is commonly believed (by myself as well) that Bitcoin is in the early-to-mid phase of S-curve growth, meaning that at some point growth will level off.  This leveling off of growth, which is expected, would represent a break in the current trend - but it wouldn't represent a failure of this overall narrative, because this narrative expects growth to level off at some point in the future.  So in this respect, if it breaks later on down the track - the market doesn't have to change its mind with respect to the narrative.\n\nNow we don't know when exactly this is going to happen, but we don't believe it will happen tomorrow.  We would expect to see a greater degree of market saturation first.  So, if the price does go to 100 tomorrow, this would mean that not only has the trend broken, but the explanatory narrative has broken as well.  Either the market has lost faith in the narrative (because it thinks it has made a mistake), or it is adapting to a new reality where bitcoin has failed to achieve that S-curve style growth.\n\nAs for clearer definitions of 'soon' and 'later'.  We just don't have them.  We know that if 't' is tomorrow - then a break of trend at 't' would be a failure in the narrative.  But what about 't' + 1. 't' + 2 - etc.  What does bitcoin market saturation look like?  Does bitcoin become a daily part of shopping and commerce for the entire world?  Or is it just a niche payment protocol used by ex-pats sending money home from their summer job?  We don't know.  These sorts of scenarios could still result in an S-curve, just different sized S-curves.  And nobody knows just what sized S-curve bitcoin is going to end up as.\n\nInterestingly, my inability to provide you with the clearer definitions you require gets right at the essential risk of investing in Bitcoin.  It's impossible to know where on the S-curve we actually are.\n\n\n": 2, 'theres a few people who have said that they get paid in btc and that its more expensive. i awaiting for a reply as to why atm': 2, 'That was also in an artificially inflated market': -6, "Market saturation would do it but that's a little ways off.": 2, "So your response is that it's not statistically likely that bitcoin will stay over $100 in the future?\n\nThat's fucking absurd.": 2, 'Except that most people who buy goods with BTC purchase that same amount of BTC the same day.

[Everett Rogers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Rogers), a professor of [communication studies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_studies), popularized the theory in his book *Diffusion of Innovations*; the book was first published in 1962, and is now in its fifth edition (2003).  The book says that diffusion is the process by which an [innovation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation) is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. The origins of the diffusion of innovations theory are varied and span multiple disciplines. The book espouses the theory that there are four main elements that influence the spread of a new idea: the innovation, communication channels, time, and a social system. This process relies heavily on [human capital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_capital). The innovation must be widely adopted in order to self-sustain. Within the rate of adoption, there is a point at which an innovation reaches [critical mass](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_mass_(sociodynamics\\)). The categories of adopters are: innovators, [early adopters](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_adopters), early majority, late majority, and laggards ([Rogers 1962](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations#CITEREFRogers1962), p.\xc2\xa0150). Diffusion of Innovations manifests itself in different ways in various cultures and fields and is highly subject to the type of adopters and innovation-decision process.\n\n\n>====\n\n>[**Image**](http://i.imgur.com/bm9qwDf.png) [^(i)](http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Diffusion_of_ideas.svg) - *The diffusion of innovations according to Rogers.

One can see this when looking deep in the order books. There are many more orders set at or around 400 than 431 on any given day. I think you explanation for the price movements around 500 reflects this definition, as people are setting their orders around 500 with an eye toward it going higher or lower.

First order of Business is to identify your stop, such as, a moving average, 1 ATR, or any level of support or resistance. Take the difference between your stop and your entry and then size your positions accordingly. \n\nAs an example. You see a set up to go long the BTC at $450 with a stop at the base of our descending triangle about $400. $50 is the difference. So your position will be 4BTC, because $200 (the max loss) divided by the difference ($50) is 4. You will only need to use $1800 of your margin in the trade. But you might also like BTC at $250 so you might reserve the rest of your margin for a flash crash.

(not a good bet) Say you like a trade off the $400 baseline with really tight stops. The, "YOU SHALL NOT PASS!" Trade. So if the price falls to say $405, you go long with a stop at say $399.99. The difference is $5.01, or $5 for easy math. You would buy 40BTC in this trade because 40X$5 is $200. In that case, you will tie up 40x$405 in margin, or $16,200 of your $25k available. \n\nI don\'t so much like the second setup because of liquidity issues.

And it looks like y\xe2\x80\x99all had a good time while I was gone.  I am still going to have to make long trips twice a week to check in, but my Mom is in a rehab facility (not drugs, broken bones) so I am done being a nurse.  And I am a shitty nurse.   I am better with charts.\n\nOK, so rather than relive the past week, I will just start afresh.\n\nAfter  the long pole warning down to $416 we recovered nicely.  Keep in mind that we are still in a downtrend, and the movements for the past several weeks have been big dip--work up--pop up--bleed down.  I am pretty sure this is NOT the bottom.  We will not confirm that until we break back through that downward pressure which right now is at $540.  So, I am not optimistic.\n\nThe positive break out point is at $510 right now.  That is a good $50-60 from where we are now.  That is more than a 10% move.  In the good old days that would have been a day or two.  Now\xe2\x80\xa6not so much.  I should take several days to get there now.\n\nAn interesting thing to consider is that the downward trend\xe2\x80\x94the blue crosses and the upward trend that we broke are just about at that positive break out point.  In the truest technical sense, that should not matter.  And, it is important to understand that humans will look to have things fit a pattern, even though there isn\xe2\x80\x99t one.  But, it means we are catching back up to the trend line.\n\nAs you step back even further, you will see Bitcoin has hugged that downward trend line for a while.  Just in the last week or so have we broken down from that trend.  It would be reasonable to think we will move back up to the trend line, even if we follow it down from there.\n\nI guess what bothers me in the current situation is that we just keep falling harder each time.\n\nMy advice is to play the swings if you can.  If you can dollar cost average, this might be a good time to just keep the same small amount going in to bring down your average cost.  And I would advise keeping some fiat dry and in a safe place.  \n\nIf we move above the trend line things could get interesting again.  Keep an eye on the lower, Silk Road collapse line.  It is rushing upward from those October lows.  It is currently at $260\xe2\x80\x94which is what I would call the "pre-bubble-bottom."  I call it this because that is the lowest trend point before the run up starting in August/September.\n\n**[Wider Angle Trend Chart](http://imgur.com/5XxhZPm)**\n\nAnother interesting point to consider is that the ultimate pre-bubble low was in July, prior to the Silk Road Take down in October.  If you make the supposition that the Silk road take down was an \xe2\x80\x9caberration\xe2\x80\x9d the long term trend line is 9 boxes higher, putting the all time low line at $305.  \n\nMore interestingly, if you take the All Time High resistance line (blue crossing coming at a down and to the right angle), and the Pre Bubble Low support line (figures coming up and to the right) and track them until they cross\xe2\x80\x94they cross at $415, 15 columns from where we are.  Recently, a month has been about 18 columns wide.\n\nAt that intersection, the bubble should be \xe2\x80\x9ctechnically\xe2\x80\x9d over.  The bitcoin world will have reverted to the mean.  \n\nI am interpreting that as the long, post bubble nightmare would finally be over.  And we can start moving ahead.  Does that mean another bubble?  Not particularly,  It might mean that we can start to rise in a steady manner that would benefit bitcoin and all of us.\n\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t need to get rich over night.  I am still positive about the overall bitcoin protocol.  \n\nBut someone in China or Washington could get a hair across their ass, and ruin everything.\n\nPlay the way you like and how you wish.

He can pull the wall and now execute the same play on the other end, putting up a large sell wall to push the price down and scare off buyers, and slowly buy up coins underneath. \n\nBy flipping and flopping repeatedly, he can keep the 'wall reserved' amounts roughly the same, but increase the value of the 'active' amount over time.

Most merchants (especially larger companies) do not want to maintain an "inventory" of Bitcoin (I say this because they will be taxed on the coins as an asset, not as a currency).  There are a lot of tax burdens on adopting businesses to actually spend Bitcoin, so it is easier for them to hold coins as shortly as possible.  This has problematic implications for Bitcoin\'s utility, and therefore its market value.\n\nEven if consumers were replenishing their supply of Bitcoin after purchasing something from a vendor, they are essentially buying back the coin they just spent.  Just to be clear, merchants have zero demand for Bitcoin.  They only want money, and although Bitcoin is worth money, it has no intrinsic value to them due to volatility and the unnecessary burden of taxable assets.\n\nThe problem with merchants being a major contributing factor in the equilibrium point is that they don\'t actually factor into the supply and demand directly.  The demand that merchants create is only by consumers wanting to pay in Bitcoin.  Most merchants are using a service such as Bitpay, where they never even touch Bitcoin.  A vast majority of Bitcoin that go into merchants\' accounts will nearly immediately get dumped back into the market.  Also, no sane merchant will only allow payment in Bitcoin, so there is no necessity for consumers to pay in Bitcoin.\n\nLike it or not, Bitcoin has nearly reached its peak exposure.

The market can't help itself and regularly goes through bubbles as speculation hype rises and falls.

The cost would for any small sized country or even just any large wall street bank be a more than bearable cost.

There are always symmetric volumes between buyers and sellers. It is a bigger assumption than Lingham believes to assume that a point of "consistent growth on a daily basis between buyers and sellers" (which I will assume to mean demand and supply) will result in a "point of stability in price."\n\nWhen I think of the long-run equilibrium price of Bitcoin, I think of the value of Bitcoin when it has reached peak exposure, and near ubiquitous merchant adoption. It could be that people choose to use Bitcoin as a currency/store-of-value/trading tool. It could be they choose to use it a lot, it could be they choose to use it a little.

Yes, we are all aware of the rumour that China will be terminating deposits.  This rumour is very well backed up by the Wall Street Journal, Reuters, and a reputable Chinese source (Caixin).

If they were just rumours, there is no way the market would be this deeply affected.  Prices have been extremely bearish for over a week on this news.  It's not without good reason.

First, is the news that China is about to disable the exchanges.  That news hit on Dec 5 (when 1 BTC=7000 RMB), and resulted in a drop which continued for 3 days and bottomed at ~4,000 RMB (43% dip).  \n\nPrices rebounded quickly, as people began discounting the rumours, since the exchanges were functioning as usual.  Prices went as high as 6,000+ RMB during the next week after the announcements from the PBOC, and settled around 5,500.  \n\nThen, on the 16th, USA time, BTC China deposits were suddenly disabled.  The price tanked again.  This time, from over 5,000 RMB to ~2,000 RMB at its lowest (on the 18th).  \n\nThere is no doubt that when (and if) deposits are fully disabled on Chinese exchanges, there will be another major drop in price.  It will likely be less significant than the drop from 5,000 to 2,000 in December, but it will be major.  \n\nSo that is why investors are waiting for the China thing to pan out.

Now it\'s 4 months later taxes are about to come due and the price has tanked 60%.  You have a $60,000 capital loss and your 100 BTC is only worth $40,000.  You can only deduct 3k of that 60k lose from your initial $100,000 of income so you still owe your typical taxes on $97,000 of income which is like 30% so say 29k which leaves the miner with 11k left.  See the problem?  If BTC went 1 cent tomorrow the miner would still owe 29k on their taxes.  That is why it is prudent if you are a large miner to sell enough BTC as you mine it to cover your expected tax liability.\n\n* I realize I\'ve greatly simplified this as there could be other deductions to reduce the income unrelated to the capital lose but the basic point still stands.': 2, "If you see a large bid it can be an indication it's going lower.

A significant dip below the regression line looks bad at the time - looks less bad with hindsight and a new regression.  So what's for me to think that if it drops below the regression line in the future the same problem won't arise?\n\nBut that doesn't apply to me.  I'm looking for the end of THIS current trend. lol... that's it.  Look at those early regression lines.  They are all dead trends.  Bitcoin never returned to those levels of growth.  And they all would have been spotted using this analysis.  There is nothing fallacious about using this regression for that purpose.\n\nI do happen to think that THIS current trend is significant - because of the large amount of data behind it.  I think it is more representative of the S-curve growth of Bitcoin as a technology network.  And if THIS trend fails then, I think we have reason to believe something significant about bitcoin has changed.  But that's a substantive claim - not just based on chart analysis, but my beliefs about the world.  Feel free to critique this - but please stop thinking I've made some kind of logical mistake.  I clearly haven't.": 1, "There's, again, two flaws in what you just wrote. Firstly you try to identify things post-hoc, with a close to present time horizon. This is actually exactly the same as trying to make predictions.\n\nAnd secondly, if you made the exact same comment, that you just did, in August 2011, you'd reach a vastly different conclusion about what happened, not just about what was gonna happen.\n\nSo if you again, make a comment in say, a year from now, drawing with the same methodology, the same regression, using the same metric, you will again, have arrived at a completely different conclusion.\n\nHow can you possibly defend, reaching conclusions when your conclusion is entirely predicated on when you take the measurement?": 6, "I do make this point in the post.  \n\nMy rejoinder is that I'm not trying to make predictions using the regression - but simply keep track of a trend.  In this case it's reasonable to think about bitcoin as following an exponential growth trend as one would for other start up type technologies.  So if you're modelling a long term trend of this sort, you're going to want to use as much data as you can find.  Because all I want to do is identify when THIS long term trend ends.  And you can't get a clear sense of that by looking at percentage moves in the price.  And you're certainly not going to be able to see it if you vary the start of your regression line arbitrarily.\n\nWhy is this useful if I'm not trying to make predictions with it?  Well - a break in this trend, depending on context, for instance - might signal that bitcoin had hit the top of its s-curve.  The regression line can be useful in identifying this, even if it's not useful in predicting it.\n\n": 2, "Yeah - so I'm trying to see your point of view - but I just don't see it happening the way you say it will in practice.

But it's hardly causing a complete revision in history.  The last two bubbles come out looking slightly bigger - like a tiny amount.  But essentially the substantive parts of my analysis above stay exactly the same.  How we look at the size of each bubble relative to one another remains the same.\n\nNote also - that in this scenario I've plotted I agree you'd hardly need this analysis to spot the break in trend.  What will more likely happen will be the continued increase in price that fails to keep pace with the trend line - which this analysis will make it a lot more easy to spot.\n\nOverall - I think the fallacy your making is that you are imagining an a-priori edge case that would indeed cause problems for me if it actually happened - and thinking that because you've found a logical possibility (no matter how unlikely) - that this somehow has any bearing on how we should think in the real world.

That\'s why I call complete utter bullshit on OPs "analysis" because IF HE HAD MADE THE SAME FUCKING ANALYSIS WITH THE SAME FUCKING METHOD WITH THE SAME FUCKING METRIC he\'d have concluded exactly the opposite ABOUT THE SAME FUCKING EXACT TIME than he did today.

And the area of the decline you painted there yellow/green after the 2011 $32 bubble, would now be deep blue to black.\n\nAt the time you would not know about the future, so the same regression methodology, minus the 20/20 hindsight would look very dire indeed using your own metric.\n\nIf you want to make predictions based on regression lines, you also need to take into account the trend that the regression line changes with. If say the line gets flatter rapidly every week you extend the time horizon, that's vastly different than a regression line that stays at the same incline week after week (btw. week would also be a bad step interval, you'd need to step forward in time geometrically so that the time step in relation to the length of all data always expresses the same interval, or you'll have time bias in the estimation)": 16, "Yeah you put the clock back a month, now put it back one or two years and see how your regression line changes.

What TA can predict is how far a breaking news story might move the price, because TA weighs heavily on well established support and resistance levels.  The people who argue that TA is useless because the market is news driven just aren\'t using TA correctly, or they don\'t know how.\n\nThere\'s nothing wrong with TA, but sometimes the haters act like people think TA is some crystal ball looking into the future.

Rallies should be suspect for the next three months because new Chinese news, real or not, will kill any rally before it begins.  Don't buy on any uptick because you will lose money.\n\nI never sell, but I'm not buying or mining now either.\n\nThe only way that the Chinese news is going to become less important is once Wall Street begins to overpower the Chinese in trade volume.  The Chinese news only has an effect now because China has some proportion of money in the system.  Every day they continue to hinder themselves in the bitcoin economy, they diminish their share, as well as the effect of their bad news.\n\nIt's pretty clear that this news is not going to go away.  It will be here for years, and will continue past the point when nobody cares anymore.  The solution to this problem is not going to occur until the Chinese marginalize themselves enough so that nobody cares about their news, which won't happen until Wall St starts buying in.\n\nBy the way, there is a precedent for this.  Last bubble, it was DDoS attacks.  Every time there was a rise, hackers just initiated another attack to stop the rally.  These attacks still continue at an unprecedented rate thanks to NTP amplification, but there are now enough exchanges that nobody cares about the hackers anymore.

Keep in mind that scrypt ASICs are not as efficient as SHA-256 ASICs.  You can't build a scrypt ASIC that's 1000 times more power efficient than a GPU.\n\nUnfortunately, scrypt ASICs may deteriorate the market before I can launch my mining pool, which I've been working on for four months.  My theory is that as pools like mine start assigning miners to different scrypt coins *at the same time*, prices and hashrate will converge so that none of them will be able to stand out in any way.  The current round of pools all mine one coin at a time.  ASICs will prevent huge bubbles in any single coin, and pools will kill new scrypt coins by directing huge collections of ASICs at them.  Stability is good for cryptocurrencies.\n\nThe next trend in altcoins is going to be coming up with your own distinct proof-of-work algorithm.  That way, nobody can make ASICs for your coin (at least at first), and the creators may believe that pools can't redirect themselves at a coin with a different algorithm (I'll show them differently,  should this scenario develop).  These new proof of work algorithms will likely be insecure and prone to 51% attacks.\n\nI'm not sure why coin developers are against ASICs.  You want mining to be expensive, so that people can't attack your coin by buying up a few CPUs.

In addition, their emotions are apt to overtake them which is also a risk. Takes a lot of discipline. And that's just for the people who are putting away monthly increments. What about the folks who are running off of a core bankroll? Oh man must that be stressful.\n\nSo the price drifting downward the way it has been since January could be seen as kind of nice. I personally like it because I'm putting in increments of money rather than playing off of a bankroll. Most of my buys have been small and between 485-630 because I have a day job and can't afford a couple thou up front. If the price explodes this summer, I will be a very happy man and try to ride the wave. If it does not and instead starts to trend upward slowly, I'll be happy I bought in steadily over this long downslope. If it keeps drifting by about a hundred a month for the next couple months, I may start to worry, but I expect there are a lot of long-term bulls with itchy trigger fingers that would love to nab some coins at under $400. Over the next ten years, even if it it makes yearly gains of over 6ish% I'll be all-around satisfied with it especially if there are extended periods of stagnation or downward movement so I can confidently buy in incrementally without feeling like I'm going to get screwed overnight.": 4, 'After responding to Justdweezil, I realized there is a simpler way to respond...\n\n1.

TL;DR reasoning below.\n\n**1. Mark Karpeles has a fraud conviction**\n\nWhen considering innocent mistake explanations, remember Mark Karpeles was already *convicted* of fraud in relation to internet payment systems before any of this. That was the reason he left France and settled in Japan - I read his 2006 blog post describing his "huge, huge mistake" with my own eyes recently. It has now been taken down, but Gawker describes the same one http://gawker.com/does-mt-goxs-ceo-have-a-secret-history-of-online-payme-1534752110.\n\n**2. It is easy to "spend" 850,000 BTC**\n\nKarpeles may have sold some amount, say 100,000 BTC, when their value was as little as $0.50 to fund his operations or cover losses due to a theft. His intention would have been to buy them back later using collected trading fees.\n\nAs we know the price of BTC rose dramatically. Thus if this happened, his only chance of paying them off would have been to sell more and hope the price dropped... since the price mainly rose and very dramatically so, he would only have had to repeat this a few times to lose the lot (rather like Nick Leeson at Barings Bank)\n\n**3. Finding 200,000 BTC is not necessarily a good sign**\n\nIf you dig into estimates of Mark Karpeles personal holdings accrued through early investments and ownership of Gox, it was 200,000 bitcoin. This newly "discovered" wallet could well be what Karpeles was holding back for himself. When some internal audit process made with independent eyes found it, likely he would have said "whoops, good job!!"\n\n**4. Lost keys**\n\nIn an earlier post I hoped that Karpeles had simply lost the keys to wallets using faulty wallet generation software and been too embarrassed to admit it. Some comments he made on IRC supported this. If this was the case, in certain cases the keys might be recoverable and I recommended haste in determining whether this had happened. I made the post before I discovered Karpeles previous conviction for payment systems fraud, which reduces the chances of there being an "innocent/simply incompetent" explanation. But although witheringly small, this is still one of the best hopes. See the original post here http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1z8fmc/mtgox_private_key_related_coin_loss_a_explanation/\n\n**5. Karpeles to prison**\n\nIMHO the guy should be locked up - he really has done enough damage.

Most of the value in bitcoin transactions is above the threshold for currency trading reporting, so the only legitimate bitching that should be happening is from dumb dumbs who thought they'd get their bitcoins all taxed at 15-23%, rather than 15-35% and requiring a hold strategy to get that 15%": 2, "Did people really think bitcoin was going to be taxed differently? Income is income, so if bitcoin was to meteorically rise and people start selling their coins, like in December, profit was going to be taxed no matter what.

Since we would never operate a fractional reserve, that probably means that the next exchange failure will take us out with it.  This is what happened with the failure of big banks in 2008; when one bank failed, the other banks lost funds and they also failed.\n\nI would pay double the trading fees of other exchanges if I could be guaranteed that our customers\' coins won\'t be lost in so-called "frozen funds" like Vircurex.

You get what you pay for.  People who value transparency will be willing to pay more for such a service, which would offset the reduced profit of using the bitcoin blockchain.

Some Vircurex customers were even aware of the scam Vircurex was perpetrating and they still kept their money there.  It\'s difficult to say whether people value honesty and transparency or not.  Messaging would be the biggest challenge; trying to figure out how to explain to people how the exchange works and why they should pay more will be difficult.\n\nNote:  I edited this post to insert here that I don\'t have to worry about FinCEN, because their ruling excluded miners as money transmitters.  As an exchange, you might have to worry about them.\n\nThe larger problem I see with these diagrams is that they are too complicated.  You can\'t just "code this up."

This number is (very) slowly rising due to poorly managed change addresses or lost keys along with burned bitcoins (coins that have been intentionally destroyed), but not nearly as much as an early miner throwing away a computer with 5x50BTC blocks on it.\n\nAlso, market price * quantity of coins is a poor way of calculating the price of Bitcoin IMO, though I don\'t really have any better ideas lol. If the US Gov were to ban Bitcoin tomorrow along with a few other countries and they internationally raided all the exchanges, I think the price on any site that still remained open would be pennies compared to what it would be before. All that money would have \'vanished\' into thin air effecting the market cap without really any exchange volume, the coins would just be worth "less".\n\nEDIT:\nhttp://readwrite.com/2014/01/13/what-happens-to-lost-bitcoins\n\nIt seems in January 2014 this article claimed that 35% of Bitcoins haven\'t moved since 2011. Though the recent Mt.Gox coin movings probably aren\'t accounted for, plus many are likely being hoarded in their original cold storage wallets. I\'d like to know how many haven\'t moved since 2010, before the first Bitcoin bubble, and how many are still in the original block there were mined in. Those would be some interesting statistics to see.': 1, 'You forgot DPR..\n\nand\n\nWinkles and second market...(these coins will never move..) \n\n': 0, 'DPR has a personal stash...\n\nand a FBI has won some ;)': 1, 'DPRs coins are going to be auctioned': 1, 'But most likely they end up in an ETF...\n': 1, 'They took his personal stash as well...
