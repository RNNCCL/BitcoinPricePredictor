It's been around for a long time, and had most of the volume of BTC trading up until earlier this year when they started to have problem after problem with their systems.  The whole BTC community began to turn against them.  But for some reason, people kept trading there.  Then about 2-3 months ago, after numerous major issues had gone public, MtGox announced that they would have to suspend USD withdrawals for 2 weeks (HA!), meaning that there was no way for you to get your USD fiat out of MtGox.  So with no other option, many people were forced to use their USD balances at MtGox to purchase BTC, and then they would transfer their BTC out to a different exchange, and sell their BTC there for USD, and then cash out their USD.  This created a small spread between MtGox and other exchanges prices, because more people were being forced to purchase on MtGox (altering the supply and demand economics of the market).  Lately that spread between Gox and other exchanges has hovered steadily around ~$10.  I've not had my USD at MtGox in 3-4 months now, ever since the original trading debacles.\n\nFor the past month or so, when the price at Mt.Gox ramps quickly, it's noticeable that the other exchanges do not immediately react to Gox's rise in price.  So the spread price will grow from $10 to $15, but typically just for a little while before the other exchanges catch up and the spread moved back down to about $10.\n\nSo today when I happened to see the price at Gox shoot up very quickly, I had a pretty good feeling that the other exchanges wouldn't begin to adjust for 15 minutes or so.  I immediately bought at the market on Coinbase and CampBX, both just under $119.  Within a few hours, both of those exchanges had ramped to about $124.  So because I was able to act quickly (I had cash on the sidelines because I didn't have a good feel for where the market was headed), I've been able to get a 3-4% return on knowing that the spread would close up.  With Gox at ~$138-139, I think the other exchanges will continue to close the spread to about $12 over the weekend (provided that Gox remains stable at $138 level).  \n\nI have no plans of selling at the moment, but I will set some stoplosses to ensure that I don't lose any money because of this trade.  \n\nNow, go do a lot of reading on Bitcoin because you're obviously really new to this since you suggested I might sell on MtGox (you're crazy, bro)": 6, "> based on little to no analysis whatsoever, that we're in for another buy in from big money within 3-5 days.\n\nI'm expecting this as well, it's been happening rather consistently for the past few weeks and clearly the price isn't gonna give in in the meantime.\n\nEdit: Well, that's just happened! Lots of hesitation going on at the moment, but at very least we should stay above $135 for now, which is still a major milestone even if the market doesn't quite accept $140 as the new normal yet.\n\n**Edit 2: Staying stable below $140 for now, but what'll happen later today and on the weekend is anyone's guess at this point.**": 8, 'Out of curiosity, what tool do you use for your stop losses?

My mistake in past is not holding fiat when the fluctuations swing the other way.': 1, 'A stop loss is an instruction to an exchange that says "If the price falls as low as $X then immediately place an order for me to sell at market price (or at $Y)".\n\nSo that if you\'re not watching the market all the time, and it unexpectedly drops, your order puts a limit on how much you can lose - hence "stop loss". The upside is that you can place one at the same time as buying in (say, at 10% below the price you bought in at), so that your maximum loss is capped to 10%, the downside is that it might be triggered by a brief fluctuation - if the price drops 10% then surges back up again, you sold out at a loss.\n\nThere\'s a similar order I can\'t quite place the name of for "If the price rises to $X, buy in", so that you don\'t miss the big upswing (similar risk of it executing on a temporary bounce). Either of them (when widely used) can act to accelerate a trend - as the market moves, open Stop orders trigger and drive it further in the same direction.': 1, 'Well predicted ;)': 8, 'Your command syntax is wrong:\n\n- http://imgur.com/CwDYZqW\n\n- http://www.reddit.com/r/bitcointip (example in the side bar)': 2, '> the yellow metal will always be favored when it goes up against a stagnating bitcoin\n\nI think you are missing an important point: if btc was simply an asset used to store wealth, gold would always be considered better, because:\n\n- it has a proven history of thousands of years as a holder of wealth\n\n- it commands such a high market share that btc would have a hard time competing (after all, you want to store your wealth in some asset you can liquidate one day)\n\n- legal risks are low and known\n\nThis is why we saw the inverse relationship between gold price and btc price.\n\nHowever, btc has gained traction as a currency (via pizza and silk road) first and become a store of wealth later and has a clear advantage over gold in this respect. So even if the gold bugs leave btc to return to their metal (personally, I hope they do, they are absolutely lowering the discussion), btc is still useful as a currency which will help to prop up price.\n\nI hope btc and gold become a bit more decoupled as the currency-aspect gains more weight and the hoarding less, but with the price rising and rising, it does seem unlikely': 3, 'I saw the initial 10K BTC purchase happen via clark moody ticker, and I jumped onto campBX and coinbase and went in.

Either the whale theory is somewhat correct and we get artificially pushed past that resistance yet again\n\n*ding dong* some whale just gobbled up nearly 20k BTC and we went to $142 briefly. Nice call :)': 3, 'Huuuh i\'m flattered that you would consider me as somewhat as experienced and insightful as /u/lalicat for example, but all i can offer is my sentiment, which is certainly not more valid, exact or founded than anyone else\'s.\n\nI\'ll happily debate anyone over anything though, just because words, people, discussion and fun.\n\nAs i\'ve said here before, my feeling is that this is a manufactured trend from the start. Whoever\'s behind this is playing a game which can very well be lost, against adversaries defending opposite goals. They intend to spark another bubble and push the price as high as possible, then dump it at least partly when they either feel that the party is over or when they\'ll have reached a big enough margin. I don\'t think we\'re talking about a rise of a couple of dollars here, but rather dozens, if not a hundred or more, if at all possible. Think April 2013 magnitude.\n\nNow there is absolutely no way to tell if we will even remotely approach these numbers again this time, but they do have the patience and some resources, although they appear to be much more conservative this time. Nowadays, they only use whatever is necessary to push or maintain the price and nothing more. I guess they have been burned before, as well as having gained some experience as to how to be most efficient at playing this game. Failing this would mean that they would\'ve lost quite a bit of funds, but i suspect that they probably won\'t fight until their very last coin and will be smart enough to cut their losses and retreat, should things get too ugly and the market decides to turn against them.\n\nI have the feeling that this is the long con, meaning that August was merely the prepping stage. They are trying to build enough momentum to pick us up into fall, hoping that the market will get all euphoric and crazy again, bringing back old investors and eventually new ones with big money. Many have been on pause since April-May by either holding overbought coins or refusing to inject fiat again, and a substantial and sustained rise could draw them back in. I\'m supposing that most of those holding those overbought coins would wait for the end of the rise to sell, hoping to make a profit out of what looked like a loss not so long ago, thus delaying the otherwise expected influx of sell orders once we pass some psychological keypoints from the last bubble. Because of that, the first retracements if we pass $140-150 could be violent. The whale will probably try to set walls accordingly to reassure everyone.\n\nRight now we are still at the end of this prepping stage, and have not yet passed the key pivot imo. Things could come back crashing relatively easily. This whole thing is mainly about trust, and it is not yet fully restored. The market has matured a bit, and people are now more wary of exponential rises. If and once we pass $140, everyone will take a breath and relax into this. This is the reason for those sideway movements followed by sudden price explosions.\n\nNo one dares to push up the price yet, leaving all the real work to the whales. They come in once in a while, suddenly drive the price up and then leave for a week or so. In-between, people merely wait on the sidelines, still a bit scared to move either way. Is this the top before yet another crash? Is this just a plateau i should buy into before another rise comes?\n\nExtreme growth does not serve us. The price needs room to breathe, and right now it is constrained at the top of the past month\'s trading channel. It needs to come back into the range somewhat, and the current pressure does not really allow for that. \n\nTo conclude this rambling, i don\'t expect us to drop below $127, if even that, before we get propped up again. We need a correction, however small, and all things being equal, most people would still like to be bullish a little too much to really dump into those buys walls. Panic and fear are still in the air though.\n\nI really doubt we will pass $135 with organic buys alone. Either the whale theory is somewhat correct and we get artificially pushed past that resistance yet again, reassuring buyers into a possible "natural" growth territory, or sellers will grow restless, start eating into that $127 and $125 support (supposing it even stays there long enough for that) and bring us back into depression until the next bubble comes along.\n\nAlthough i\'m personally long right now, because all of this depends more on the plan of a few manipulators rather than on widespread market sentiment, it\'s really up to anyone\'s guess if we will be brought above $135 in the next few days. In other words, i don\'t know more than any of you, but at least i told you so from the first sentence and yet you still decided to read all this.

It seems that price is no longer related to the news, and I think that\'s because most speculators have exited the market (there were many opportunities to do so in the recent months) and only the people that are bullish in the long-term remain. Remember that recent "Bitcoin illegal in Thailand" news didn\'t move price a bit. This is likely to change though with the next bubble forming; I expect bubble to be in full swing during September, many more short-term speculators to enter or re-enter market than in the last bubble, and that will of course start moving price on news again.\n\nOn the other hand, I might be wrong. Subpoenas and regulation are not necessarily bad news and might warrant increase in price; Bitcoin community is aware that some form of regulation is necessity for mainstream adoption. The big scare is that the major countries will force too much regulation and stifle adoption. This is especially a risk with USA with their various wars on drugs or terrorism or buzzword-of-the-day which result in less and less liberties. But there were important precedents in the USA and I think subpoenas (as opposed to FBI raids and blocking of bank accounts) are a good sign.': 3, "At least it's pretty decentralized, and the whole oligarchy thing is pretty hard to achieve with BTC in its current state.": 1, 'It wasn\'t a negative "let\'s find court evidence" subpoena, it was a request for information on how it works.
