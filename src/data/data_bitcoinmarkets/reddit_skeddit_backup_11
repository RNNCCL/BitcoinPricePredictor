So far so obvious. \n\nSo if you look at stamp you see that there is a high amount of asks. when we are pushing towards a new higher level it can happen that the ask side is raised by 20.000 to 30.000 coins. The benefit of this is to show the traders that there is very much resistance  and it is most Likly  not worth to push since it is unlikely  that someone will buy 30.000 to 40.000 coins the price on stamp will stay lower. In the meantime bitfinex  will go higher and higher and the price difference will grow. This is wenn the arbitrage  traders(or their bots) kick in. They buy coins from other exchanges and sell them on the highest one. This will create restistance  on the exchange which jumps ahead. \n\nBasically  you can slow other exchanges  down by keeping one exchange low. \n\nThere are several  reasons  why somebody would like to do that. Let's say in gereral to create a save trading space. \n\nSo far so good so you need to add padding to the order book on stamp to keep the impression that there is much less demand than offers to keep the market low and give the buyers the danger that the value crashes as soon as they bought. So you write a bot  which adds sell orders. But you don't want this orders to be filled. You would prefer that other sellers place their order below and add to the resitance.  therefore your bot needs to check the distance to the last order and pull back if necessary and move the padding down if possible. Sometimes when a bug buyer shows up the padding will be eaten. Mostly  it is completely  pulled when about 10% of the padding was eaten .  \n\nSo I asume that when you see the sell orders are pulled that something on the buy or sell side change to trigger their script. And the padding is readded  when the trigger is removed. Or the bot is just not so well coded. \n\nThis is my explanation  but I cannot be sure that this is really  correct. \n\nPadding the order book with orders which are not supposed to be filled and are solely  there to give a wrong impression  of the market is illegal and punishable  in almost  all regulated markets. But bitcoin  is not regulated. \n\n\n\n\n": 2, 'I yield to your superior experience.': 1, "Shhh don't jinx it!": 3, 'finally somebody talking sense up in here\n\ni am now all in': 24, 'Haha yeah that makes sense.

Some cryptocurrency *will* catch on in the next 5-10yrs. If bitcoin can manage to be in the lead at that time, then moon.\n\n2. The longer bitcoin hangs on, the more likely one of two things will happen: (a) killer app will be found and actual usage will drive adoption and virtuous cycle will unfold (price rise leads to more interest, more usage, further increase in price until we hit a new plateau and then bitcoin is that much further ahead of all the other cryptos) or (b) another bubble. the reasons behind the bubble don't matter much, just the fact of the bubble will change everything.

In simulations, the market generally worked well but occasional edge cases would cause unacceptable loss.\n\nThe DPE system improves upon the socialized loss model by publishing the predicted rate in realtime, allowing traders to work an expected loss % into the traded price. We also help prevent market manipulation by forgoing liquidations when the price of a future has gone too far out of band from the underlying indicative price.

At least you are completely transparent about fucking your own traders, unlike some of the other exchanges which we should leave unnamed. We do have to give you some credit though in your marketing of this change, at least you portray it as a positive/benefit to users.\nOur first piece of feedback? Fix your LTC margin platform before trying to raise fees on your traders that use it.\nLet\'s think a little bit more into this situation... Why have there been more traders on LTC than BTC recently that "weren\'t able to keep their lower tiers"? Maybe it\'s because your BTC fees are too high to start off with, so they were taking advantage of the increased volatility in LTC (and lower fees) in order to attempt to profit. For many traders it\'s impossible to profit off of trading BTC intraday because of the fees involved, hence their move to other exchanges (or they have stopped trading these tiny moves because fees eat up too much profit).\nWhy don\'t you guys take into consideration your market makers and the impact that they have on the market place (trading at reduced fees I\'m sure). Just because they are "making the spread", or implementing other market making strategies, you do realize that this is discouraging other traders from using your exchange? Sure, they "increase liquidity", but they aren\'t going to walk away without a profit. It\'s pretty obvious by looking at the order book who the market makers are, and traders aren\'t fucking dumb (anymore) when it comes to this. Why am I going to spend .2% to enter a position when a market maker has a buy or sell imbalance and the order book is reflecting this? Oah wait, I won\'t!\nMaybe some type of limit as to the percentage of the order book the market makers are allowed to make up would be a great starting point.\nIn summary, what do we see here? BFX, which we considered to be the most respectable and stand up exchange in the eco-system, has gone to the dark side. They are missing out on LTC trading fees, and can\'t run a decent LTC margin trading platform so they have been refunding customers (yes, we received a USD refund) and need to make up for it. It appears as if nothing more then pure greed comes into play here, as there is no benefit to traders (at all) from this change.\nAll in all, this is nothing less than a complete scumbag move from an exchange which has taken the high road so far in this insane world of bitcoin. From a business perspective, this modification to the fee structure is complete suicide. As the USD leading exchange right now, BFX\'s concentration should be on providing value added services to traders/customers, or working on new projects (or reduced fees - which traders have been calling for) which will set them apart as new competition begins to spring up globally. These could also generate additional revenue streams. Alphapoint was supposed to be installed "in 2 weeks" (not a direct quote, we are making a joke) months ago, and the current trading engine still glitches ALL THE TIME. Instead of tending to matters which actually matter to traders and the function of their exchange, BFX has decided to focus on profits.\nRemember the bot freak out a few weeks ago? We do: https://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/3dn1tq/bfx_bot_gone_wild/\nSo instead of working on a solution to fix their orderbook/API, BFX is going to be increasing fees on all traders. People like the bot operator who replied in that thread will now be fucked out of even more money, now due to fees + incompetence.\nBFX - we have always promoted you as the leading exchange, and had many positive things to say about the services you offer. A little bit of marketing and polite wording isn\'t really enough to cover over a completely transparent move.\nWhy not be completely honest with traders instead of sugar coating it if this is the move that you want to make? Being straight forward won\'t make you look so bad (traders can do simple maths), and a little honesty goes quite a long way in the bitcoin space if you haven\'t noticed.\nIn addition, we would suggest you be honest with yourselves and reflect upon the reason why you may not be generating the fees that you would like based on your current structure. Hint: It\'s nothing to do with the current fee structure, but rather the other variables (some of which we have outlined in this post) that most traders are in the dark about.\nSeems as if, overall, this is more of an issue with a lack of proper business development and planning rather than the current fee structure. BitMEX, for example, offers a variable fee structure which can be chosen by the user based on their trading style/strategy. Perhaps a bit of out of the box thinking like this, rather than just fucking every single customer (except market makers) would be a better solution?\nWe will continue to use your platform, as we feel that BFX is more trustworthy than those other exchanges which we will leave unnamed. This move though, starts to make us question certain issues which we haven\'t in the past.\nIf you would like some additional suggestions or business development help, we are always here and would love to contribute (for a fee of course, maybe it will make up for what we have lost due to exchange malfunctions). Our goal is to provide a positive impact on the btc eco-system in order to promote growth and accountability. This new fee structure does neither.

The capital controls in China are supposed to limit RMB transfers to $50k/year. Is the pipeline outlined above curtailed in any way?\n\nVery easy. There are traders that send large amount of CNY to the exchanges and there isn\'t any issue. From the Chinese governments\' side of things, everything is fine because it\'s just going from one chinese bank account to another, you\'re not directly withdrawing the money to a foreign bank. The only issue you\'d probably have would be on the receiving country side asking about the $100,000 and where it\'s coming from. \n\n>Is there a viable OTC market in China to help prevent slippage? \n\nMajority of mining happens in China, so yes there\'s a very large OTC market in China. \n\n>Are they flagging bank accounts which have anything to do with btc and closing/freezing them? \n\nNot to my knowledge, and I regularly used a bank account to send CNY to from chinese exchanges. \n\n>If you bought $200k+ of those token things\n\nI think you\'re referring to reseller codes, and those don\'t exist anymore, you just directly transfer the money to the exchanges account. \n\n>Is it difficult avoid being caught, without actually doing anything illegal, other than moving your own money out of China? \n\nNo.\n\n>Considering slippage and exchange fees, is it really cheaper to use BTC than it is to go through wire transfers?\n\nYes. \n': 4, "I am an American, I live in Shanghai.

I had seen potential in some arbitrage from that country and wanted to know how this interacted with their capital controls. Before I started to do anything I scheduled an appointment with the local bank and told them what I was wanting to do and straight up asked them if this was legal and allowed per their policy. Their answer was that technically sending bitcoins anywhere was not considered violating capital controls, as the money itself actually never leaves the country. The money merely switches hands between two people in the country, facilitated by an exchange situated in said country. Hence no problem for them. This approach may work for you, too. If you're worried about getting your account flagged for bitcoin related matters, try scheduling an appointment with a new bank where you don't have an account yet. If they say it's okay, open an account there, send over the money (I would start in small increments to see if they hold their word, it also insulates you from sudden price fluctuations while your bitcoin are in transit) and execute from the new bank. Also keep in mind that your US bank may start asking questions about the origin of the money, so have the origin-bank-bitcoin-bank paper trail ready and documented for them. This may take some time for them to verify, during which your funds may or may not be available. I would consider giving them a heads up and inquire about procedure to make it go smoothly. All transactions over $10k are flagged world wide afaik. Staying under the $10k limit per transaction to purposely avoid being flagged is called money structuring and is a federal criminal offense, if I'm not mistaken.

': 0, "Yeah Bitmex recently introduced the 25x contracts with DPE. Which is basically another word for socialized losses.\n\nYeah I think your point of your post isn't because of some sort of misconceptions with the Bitmex platform but to clear misconceptions and the stigma against socialized losses.\n\nBitmex has quite a similar implementation to Okcoin. One difference is that all the contracts are on separate systems instead of losses being pooled together. Bitmex puts leftovers from the 1% maintenance margin liquidation into an insurance fund just like Okcoin, but unlike Okcoin their insurance fund has not accumulated a balance and they didn't initially seed it with any funds.\n\n20x vs 25x is quite similar. They both offer a 1% maintenance margin but in terms of risk it is quite different. In terms of liquidity, that 1% should probably be lower risk on Okcoin. \n\nAlso Bitmex has another problem/challenge since they're using quanto contracts. Quanto contracts have a premium because when the price goes up you make more with quanto contracts and when it goes down less than with inverse contracts. So because Bitmex can have low liquidity, they have something called fair bias to prevent manipulation. One problem is that you can't be sure if it's manipulation or if because of market forces the amount of premium has changed. That could possibly result in more socialized losses.\n\nAs for Litecoin, Bitmex is using 2% maintenance margin. They're not going to have as much liquidity as Okcoin and also Okcoin 1% maintenance on LTC hasn't been doing that good. LTC has been quite volatile recently.\n\nLastly, one of the biggest differences is that Bitmex shows a socialized loss percentage indicator. It gives a bit more information to the trader about what socialized losses might be. I also think it's slightly misleading since it doesn't account for more trades happening over the week and that it'll change when the price shifts. Basically it's just a stat. Maybe the socialized losses will be higher because of the transparency.\n\nWhile Okcoin does not give a percentage number they offer quite detailed statistics in the blasting record. They give a detailed list of all forced liquidations that have been filled and not filled, they list the bankruptcy price that the forced liquidation triggered at. There's also shows the current system loss for each forced liquidation. While an estimate is not given the total system losses is shown, and the forced liquidations that are open are quite transparent. They also show data for the insurance fund.\n\nAnyways enough comparing. Socialized losses is a great concept that is used to reduce risk for an exchange and gives them the ability to offer high leverage. Through this high leverage, future markets for Bitcoin has attracted a lot of liquidity and it's extremely relevant to the Bitcoin price. For example there was a 10k BTC position that could be longed on weeklies today. You can't get that type of position on any exchanges right now.\n\nBack to socialized losses, the system has also had to have some adjustments. Okcoin switched from 0.5% maintenance margin on 20x to 1%. They also started using the leftovers towards the insurance fund. It makes quite a bit of sense why they do this and Bitmex adopted to do the same thing. 1% maintenance margin is crazy, you're not going to see that without a risk system.": 3, 'Thanks for your response. I will change some of the tone of my post because I am not trying to be negative about Bitmex.

': 2, 'Noted, thanks.': 1, 'Hi /u/Bitcorn_For_10 and /r/bitcoinmarkets,\n\nThis appears to be simply a misunderstanding of the recent changes that we\'ve made to the BitMEX platform. \n\nBitMEX\'s focus from the very beginning has been to provide a safe, professional trading environment. Our original focus was toward hedging products as no other exchange offered futures suitable for hedging. We are still true to this model with our XBU series today.\n\nA brief bit of history:\n\nWhen we first launched the platform, we launched the XBT (quanto) series only, which offered up to 5x leverage. This is very similar to our existing XBT future - settles at 1000 satoshis per US$ price. It featured a complex risk management system similar to leveraged instruments in traditional finance that prevented any need for socialized losses. We intended this as a hedging product.\n\nTo expand the hedging products we offered, we expanded to the XBU series, which is an inverse future much like OKCoin\'s. It settles at $100 of Bitcoin. This is easier to use for hedging. Like XBT at the time, it offered up to 5x leverage and had no need for socialized losses.\n\nTo expand our market share, we started extending our trading engine to better handle more speculative products. We started with BVOL, the volatility future, and launched 25x leverage on XBT just a few weeks ago. This required a restructuring of how we handle risk as our existing model simply couldn\'t cope with such highly leveraged products. We wanted to continue to offer proper hedging futures - like XBU - while expanding into the market previously served only by Chinese exchanges.\n\nDPE stands for Dynamic Profit Equalisation - the name and summary pages are very clear about what it is, and the trading dashboard shows a real-time display of the estimated loss percentage. Contracts without DPE (the XBU series) are clearly labeled as "No Loss Contracts". We have never claimed that our highly leveraged futures do not carry a risk of profit adjustment.\n\nWe are sorry that this appears to have caused confusion, and there is likely more we can do to differentiate between the contracts that are subject to loss and the ones that are not. It is likely that you heard of us months ago before this feature was developed, and you may have missed our announcement. You are absolutely right in saying that these kinds of highly speculative products cannot be offered without risk of loss.\n\nI hope that helps.

The presentation was part of the Program for Financial Studies' No Free Lunch Seminar Series.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4z1FSdN_GA#t=800\n\nregarding testing relative latency on Bitfinex, this makes things even more complicated:\nHowever, what Bitfinex did was they introduced something they now refer to as speed bumps. **What it means is that they essentially flag orders** they deem as invalid or potentially dangerous **and slow them down intentionally**\nhttp://www.matlabtrading.net/main/2014/08/16/follow-bitcoin-flash-crash-august-2014-and-the-importance-of-transparency/": 2, 'ping is not your only form of latency to the exchanges , its how long the  round trip the calls are. Since you use bitfinex let talking about just placing an order. On a normal day from my trading platform this can vary under the perfect conditions, between .007 to .01 seconds. The reporting ie order history adds about .5-3 seconds . not bad right ?. Now during high trafic times youll see execution take up to 10 seconds on a market order and reporting take on average 20 -25 seconds...(sometimes hitting HTTP upper timeout) more if they have a system issues like was reported a few weeks ago.\n\nThe way you deal with this as a developer is to wrap all your REST calls in timeouts.. for example if bitfinex takes longer then N seconds to respond an order placement. kill the call, send cancel , wait. try again.\n\n\nNoob developers and script kids tend to only plan for perfect conditions, the worst occurs and then they get rekt.\n\n': 4, 'What it really seems you have a problem with is the difference between digital "real-time" and analog "real-time".  By your definition of real-time (from a physics perspective), literally nothing in computing is real-time.  Even the speed of light has latency so I guess even analog real-time isn\'t really real-time.  Is there such thing as a real-time observation of sunlight?  Or is this flawed because the light you see actually left the sun 8 minutes ago?  8 minutes surely isn\'t real time...\n\nI can\'t argue that you\'re technically correct.  When doing HFT in a competitive market, the latency you experience **compared with the latency experienced with other traders** certainly is of utmost importance.  You should really compare the difference in time between the data you\'re getting and the data the other traders are getting, rather than comparing against the exact time when a trade or order occurred on the exchange itself.\n\nYou also shouldn\'t lump in all "trading Bitcoin" activities with HFT activities.  There are lots of ways to trade any financial instrument.  People trading off a daily and weekly charts are very well served by "real-time" data that has 1-2 seconds of latency.  Even if you\'re colocated in the same DC as the exchange, you\'re never going to get real-time figures from their API when compared to trades taking place in the trading engine.  The OkCoin real-time trade history feed on Coinigy is just as fast as the real-time trade history feed on OkCoin itself.  A more accurate title imo would be "Why latency always matter if you are doing high frequency trading".\n\nFrom a philosophical point of view, this kind of reminds me of Schrodinger\'s cat.  What exactly is real-time?  Does the correct real-time occur whenever the first information about a trade or order occurring makes it out of the trading engine?  IE. if there was 30 seconds of lag in the trading engine reporting, and nobody (not a bot, not a human, nobody) found out about the trade for 30 seconds, would it still be "real-time" the second the data was released?  Is your observation of sunlight happening in real-time, or is it not because that light left the sun 8 hours ago?  If a tree falls in the woods and nobody is there to hear it, does it make a sound?  What if you were there to hear it.... did you hear it in real-time?\n\nThanks for the interesting post.  :D\n': 2, 'you are right, people are misusing the term and the hypothetical concept of real-time is not flawed. but only the same as the hypothetical perpetual motion machine does exit.\n\nthe term "real-time" does imply "zero latency" or "instantaneous" for most of the people who are not familiar with "Real-time computing" from computer science. i meant the term "real-time" from a physics perspective. \n\nat least most of the people think a "Real-time clock" would be accurate, and that\'s where the first mistake happens\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_clock\n\nthere are practical limitations e.g. of time synchronization: even if you are using the same satellite as the exchange to synch time between your base stations, the maximum possible accuracy is still only 1 nanosecond.': 1, "> the concept of \xe2\x80\x9creal-time\xe2\x80\x9d is completely flawed.\n\nIt's not the concept of real-time that is flawed.

The same service simply costs more (and still way less than any other comparison).  \n\nBut as you said, it caused a "minor and temporary QoS decline," which I will agree with for anyone who had a low-fee transaction stuck.  Their transactions could, however, have cleared with still a very low fee (a wallet implementation).  Nonetheless, this minor QoS decline is not urgent, especially when they are temporary and have alternative solutions.\n\nOn the other hand, if there is real demand and fees start to increase (through wallet implementation) to the point where users are going to bail leading to a price decline--which will be painful to miners--it would take practically no lobbying to get miners to agree to a one-time cap increase to meet demand.  At this point the problem is urgent, and thankfully there are already coded solutions.\n\nIt was this thinking that caused me to take down my XT node two days ago.  (I posted this on /r/Bitcoin and committed karmakaze).  There is no urgency.  The irony is that Gavin did not seem to find this as being too urgent until the Lightning Network idea had been floated and shown to be possible, but the LN may make it so that increasing the Block Size is never necessary.  I began to question why he made it, even proclaimed it, urgent.  It\'s not.\n\nThere is no doubt that bumping the cap size to 8G over 25 years could easily explode the required capacity such that no ordinary user could even run a node.  Why make it "urgent" to do this when there are other solutions in the works that could maintain decentralization and scale Bitcoin at the same time?

": 4, 'If I wanted to destroy the bitcoin network with a 51% attack, I could start buying lots of miners.  But as soon as I did that, manufacturers would simply produce more, because someone is buying them.  My attack would become increasingly expensive, since every miner I buy causes more miners to be produced to work against me.  The producers of miners have no stake in the network and as long as they don\'t overproduce, they have nothing to lose once everyone\'s miners become worthless.\n\nIf I wanted to destroy the Ethereum network, I could start buying lots of Ethereum.  Unlike miners, there is a set supply of Ethereum, so nobody can make more to stop me.  Furthermore, once I start to get a lot of it, people will realize what\'s happening and the price of Ethereum will go down in anticipation of the attack\'s success, making it easier (not more difficult) to complete the attack.  It would cost much less than 50% of the market capitalization of Ethereum to destroy the network.\n\nThis should illustrate why pure proof of stake, which has never been tested before on such a wide scale, deserves caution from investors.\n\n---------------------\n\nIn other news, I think that the block size debate is close to being committed to upgrade.  There\'s already about 2% conversion to the new XT nodes, before XT is even officially released.  Pool after pool is adding messages in blocks saying they support the upgrade - and I find it hard to believe that these miners will resist when the change they wanted is already available just because it\'s not in the "Core" version.  However, I think that there are two problems that point to lower prices in the interim.\n\nFirst, /u/theymos is continuing his censorship of /r/bitcoin and bitcointalk.org.  If he only were censoring one forum, this would be a sideshow.  The problem is that he not only has ironclad control of the bitcoin media, but he also has 3 million dollars (stolen donations for "forum upgrades," ironically) and a lack of morality.  As we all know, money opens doors; in addition to his shadowbans and selective deletions, he could start using his money to sue detractors, buy paid articles at "news sites" like cryptocoinsnews.com, and so on.  Most importantly, few people seem to care about this: while he has been making people like me look like an uninformed idiot for months, his posts get plenty of downvotes but little action.\n\nSecond, the Core developers could still mess this up and come up with a competing proposal before enough momentum has locked in the upgrade.  The danger is not in the current argument between no fork and /u/gavinandresen\'s fork; it\'s between Andresen\'s fork and someone else\'s incompatible fork.  Suppose that the Core developers decide that they want some completely incompatible proposal, like a complex fee-based algorithm.  The obvious way to implement it would be to increase the version number of the blocks to 4, as was designed in the initial protocol.  But wait - now there are two sets of "version 4" blocks.  Nobody knows how such software that was purposely designed to be incompatible will react in the real world.  That stinks because it doesn\'t really matter what the solution to this problem is.  As long as the solution is permanent, nobody will care whether there are 6MB blocks or 12MB blocks to start.\n\nAnd that\'s why /u/theymos\'s censorship is so insidious.  Andresen, Hearn, and now more than 100 other people are committed past the point of no return.  Theymos is one of the greatest risks to bitcoin right now because he is delaying the transition and allowing a competing proposal to have more time to see the light of day.  I get more and more nervous that it\'s time to sell out, because the day we see theymos and the Core developers come up with some other solution could result in a war that results in "off-blockchain" solutions becoming the standard.': 2, "It's different with Ethereum.\n\nWith bitcoin, buying a lot of it doesn't influence the security of the network.

Observant traders will see that someone is going to take over the network - and if that happens, their stake will go down.

That was predicted by Mark T. Williams who is a lecturer on risk management at Boston University, and was also a senior executive of a commodities trading firm, and therefore knows a lot about speculation.\n\nHere is his take on the current pricing of Bitcoin:\n\n>Small business owners need to be cognizant of the fact that Bitcoin\nprices were only $13 at the start of 2013 and could easily drop to the same\nlow level in the near future. In an efficient capital market, capital flows to its\nhighest and best use as investors seek a tradeoff between desired risk and\ndesired return. When investors receive timely, accurate and transparent\ninformation, the likelihood of an asset bubble is diminished. However, even in\nefficient and well-developed financial market, it is not uncommon to\nexperience bubbles (e.g., Dotcom 2000, Real Estate 2007).\nAll asset bubbles are similar in that they have three phases: growth,\nmaturity and pop. However, not all asset bubbles see prices collapse during\nthe final phase; sometimes prices deflate over an extended period allowing\n10\ninvestors to experience lower losses and softer landings. Bitcoin entered the\ngrowth stage in 2011, the maturity stage in 2013 and now is in the pop stage.\nSince December 2013 rapid price swings continue to demand that owners\nwatch prices on a daily and even hourly basis. If small business owners are\nwilling to accept Bitcoin they need to stay vigilant in monitoring the high\nprobability of a pronounced price collapse.\nIn December 2013, when prices were still over $1,000, I indicated that\nBitcoin could drop to $10 or below (http://cognoscenti.wbur.org/2013/12/05/bitcoincurrency-mark-t-williams).\nThis prediction was based on several observations\nincluding the underlying option value of this new and uncertain technology,\nprice level at the start of 2013 and the percentage price drop associated with\nthe 1637 Tulip Mania Bubble9. On January 24, 2014, Nobel prize-winner\neconomist Robert Shiller stated \xe2\x80\x9cit is a bubble, there is no question about it\xe2\x80\xa6\nit\xe2\x80\x99s just an amazing example of a bubble.\xe2\x80\x9d As articulated by Coinbase, as part\nof its new customer disclosure statement, business owners have to be\nprepared for the chance that Bitcoin prices could drop to zero. \n\nHis original prediction was not accurate, but it is absolutely a bubble, and it is debatable whether it will continue to collapse in slow motion. The absolute core issue you need to understand is that the fundamental value of Bitcoin is very small indeed, due to the fact that even if an entire new billion dollar industry was to spring up centred around Bitcoin tomorrow, it would only need to move the price upwards by a couple of hundred dollars, if that - all other price increase would be speculation over and above this intrinsic value rise. Legitimate interest and use of Bitcoin can increase massively, and it would not necessarily put any demand pressure on Bitcoin. It is that over-speculated that the price even now is merely a distortion of reality and a classic example of "Greater Fool" theory.\n\nI don\'t know whether it will collapse further. Perhaps there\'s a golden ratio to be found between the optimum speculation valuation and the true intrinsic value, where speculative value increases in proportion to demand. In which case, we\'d expect no dramatic price decrease in the short term as there\'s a good chance that the recent bubble collapse has restored that ratio, but we still face a significant risk of dramatic price decrease over the decade as people don\'t find a use for it or find a better alternative, speculators realise this and pull all of their money out to seek better returns.\n\nOn a purely technical note, comparing the value ratios involved in the [1980s gold bubble](http://b-i.forbesimg.com/rickferri/files/2013/04/GoldFig22.jpg), it looks like Bitcoin might have bottomed out, as it appears to have followed a similar pattern downwards.': 5, '>That seems very very unlikely though.\n\nUnlikely based on what statistics?': 1, "it could very well lose 99% of its value if people move on.

Litecoin has 20% up days, and 5% down days (on avg) ignoring the large dump. Anyways you want to identify the trading range after a consolidation find the tops and bottoms. I\'m looking for the bottoms. So the lowest bottom I could see us having if we continue the bull trend is 283.5. The hardest part about trading is the discipline to wait for the trade to come to you. You should\'t have to ask yourself "is this the good trade I\'ve been looking for?" It should scream at you to take the trade. So by being patient and disciplined you  build a positive feedback loop in your confidence. This allows you to trade emotionless because you are following a very structured set of rules.

However, their market is running on fumes and the chinese govt. has actually introduced capital controls to keep assets in equities. China is also dealing with its own swap crisis similar to the MBS experience in the US - the only difference is that money has been loaned to infrastructure companies and local governments to generate returns, which has been done at higher and higher interest rates. Eventually this debt will not be serviced. *TL;DR - Equities, bonds, and cash are all scary in China right now.*\n\nSo what does this mean? There are few escape hatches left. Chinese investors probably want 1 of 2 things:\n\n1. Store of value (i.e.) gold. Equities will correct in china, eventually. It is russian roulette to sit in the stock market.To the extent that chinese can buy up gold as a store of value, they will do so. I'm not familiar with their capital controls, but I would expect chinese to allocate 100% - x of their assets into products that can store value - gold, bitcoin, commodities, etc. **Here's the interesting part:** Commodities are headed down. For a long time. It's a widespread long-term bear market, and any basket of commodities is way down, so that's just about as horrifying as bitcoin is. I would guess that more than a few investors are looking at BTC as an innovative play to circumvent the commodities bear market while still retaining value outside of equities and bonds, and are willing to take a similar risk for a much more attractive potential profit. Back to square 1 here - is the BTC bear market over?\n\n2. Escape - if there's no safe haven in china, you need to get your assets out of china. I'm not sure what capital controls are on the chinese engaging in foreign markets. Otherwise, that either means real estate and real assets, going to macau and laundering your money through a casino, some other method of pretty explicit fraud, or using BTC to transfer.

How many people are running XT and moving to other forums just because of his censorship? Hell, I'm thinking about running an XT node just out of spite. \n\nIf he had good arguments, he wouldn't need to so blatantly shut down so many threads and comments about XT. He could present his case and kill XT through persuasive, rational arguments. Really, the best thing for him, and the rest of us would be for him to step down as moderator and let somebody else in. \n\nBut this wouldn't be Bitcoin without all sorts of drama. It's fun to be a firsthand observer to all the craziness surrounding the early days of this currency.": 54, 'Yes one has to ask what is he so afraid of and sounds like it must be a reasonably good solution if he has to try to suppress any discussion of it.

So long as it's not in an all-out catastrophic crash, the price being sold downward means that some buys are being hit (some of which are margin buys, which then take swap as they execute) *and* the price being lower makes going long look more attractive in the 'buy the dip' sense.\n\nThe price going up slowly/steadily might produce a slightly higher swap rate (prices goes up because of more longs, more longs = more demand for swaps), but it only *really* drives swap rates up to their highs when there's a clear expectation of it continuing to go up, in a big irrational bubble movement. Whereas in these long-lived bear market times, the price going up saps interest in any further swaps as it becomes gradually harder for anyone to justify buying on margin, in case it's at the top.\n\nThe super-high rates, like todays, tend to be short-lived little bursts where there's been a rush of activity on the market that's run through all the available swap funds.

There is still a risk that older block explorers or exchanges would continue on an old version of Core after the fork - these services could be tricked into accepting worthless deposits.\n\nOnce it is clear which way the community is going, I am sure that any exchange that is at risk of loss will upgrade immediately. At this time, there is no risk in switching to XT.
