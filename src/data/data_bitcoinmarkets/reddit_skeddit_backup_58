The US economy is "losing" that money, Canada "gaining". In a perfect world/vacuum scenario where forex reacts solely to that piece of information, this would cause a drop in the USD/CAD pair. \n\nThings are never that simple though. In reality, the forex markets can react to hundreds of different things on any given tick. Interest rate decisions, QE, Jobs data, you name it, it can move the market. Even non-voting members of the Federal Reserve here in the US making a speech can have massive effects on the market. \n\nWith the B$ economy in its infancy, there\'s nothing to really compare it to though.

At the end of the day, I don't think the price matters to the majority of people accepting Bitcoin.  The merchants accepting Bitcoin will exchange Bitcoins for their local currency.  Bitcoin as a currency will function at any price, and the current usages do not create enough demand for it to be above 50$, let alone 100$.\n\n\nWhat about Bitcoin as a store of value?

Gox, it's more difficult for new money to enter the exchange. New money keeps the price up.\n* It's more risky to be trading BTC now than it was 3 months ago. If the US gov froze all of Gox's assets, would anyone really be that surprised? After Liberty Reserve, and Bitfloor, traders have legitimate reasons to be fearful. (Not to mention other issues like CoinLab)\n* Bitcoin experienced a serious bubble frenzy. It broke $100 on March 31st and peaked at $266 on April 9th.

The market is going to establish a new baseline; we just have to wait.\n\nASIC sales could contribute to a decreasing price if the market starts to experience a violent selloff.
