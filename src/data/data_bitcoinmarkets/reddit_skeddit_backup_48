The question is, when and what causes the crash.

I\'m feeling very bearish, the market is really showing itself to be pretty unsure of what to do with the current price point, which isn\'t a good sign after a very large price increase in a short time ($100 to $1200 within a month or two). Part of the reason why its sustaining itself at this point vs. what it did in previous bubbles, is because the market is much more mature now, there is a lot of exchange competition, and there is still positive buzz about the long term success of bitcoin. The question is, how long and how well all that can really hold the price up.   \n  \nWe are still in overbought territory, but thanks to the current market factors the worst case scenario I think will happen to the price in the short/mid term is a lack in rise causing enough doubt to drop the price back down into proper long-term price average for BTC (previously this was at or near $150-$185, I\'m expecting it to be near $350-$450 now, possibly slightly higher).  \n  \nEven though I think we are overbought and I\'m bearish, I do still think its very likely we\'ll see a run up to $1500 or even $1800 before a real bear market is entered in the mid-term, driving the prices back down to the "real" logarithmic price average. If we hit these points, I\'m expecting a traditional crash event to happen. However its also very likely we stay sideways for a long enough time for the market to lose confidence in going higher which will cause a slower but steady price drop, like what we saw with this weekend but lasting over a period of several weeks instead of the weekend.  \n  \nIn either case, I really don\'t see this holding any of the same steam we had through November. The media buzz has died down, things are quieter, and its getting easier and easier for significant price drops to happen over price rises. A lot of the current price rise speculation is getting to be more and more of a stretch too. And if we aren\'t going vertical (if such a thing can even happen with BTC), which we won\'t be until Bitcoin is in a much better place to enter mainstream easy-as-hell adoption, then this current price bubble is very likely running out of steam to keep things up for much more in the short/mid term.': 4, 'no bubble\n\nthis is the birth of a new computer network\n\nthus\n\nwe will see continued growth until a final plateau.\n\nmy guess:\n\nnear $100,000 - $1,000,000\n': -3, '.': 1, "I've also gone full fiat.

In my honest opinion, i believe a crash would only occur if a massive load is sold off at almost the exact same time, i.e. a coordinated attack. Another reason for a crash would of course be negative news of great importance. \n\nI anticipate minor corrections in the price as we progress further. I could see 10-20% drops in price happening quite frequently whenever we reach new substantial peaks, but i simply don\'t see a major crash happening anytime soon.\n\nOf course, this is just speculation, but i genuinely don\'t believe traditional economic speculation works with bitcoin. Just because there has been certain behaviour in the market previously, at several occasions, does not dictate the future. The market is very different, and there is a lot less volatility at this point than there was back in April. Bitcoin is starting to give some kind of promise, and people want to hold on to their coins rather than sell them off.\n\nI know personally, i wouldn\'t sell at any point unless i was 99% confident we would have a major crash, and the sole purpose would be to buy back in for every penny once the price went as low as i thought it could.': 4, "can you explain to me how [my graph](http://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=buy+bitcoin#q=buy%20bitcoin&cmpt=q) relates to bubble % growth? also, i'm confused by your numbers... can you clarify?\n\n>B1 = 1, B2 = 5x , B3 = 1.5x": 1, "Bitcoin isn't owned by anyone either.

They never lived through these crashes.  To them, all they\'ve seen is the price rise rather steadily.  In some ways, they are 30-year-olds like me, who got fed up with the saturation of JFK anniversary coverage and wondered why it was such a big deal.\n\nIf you drew a line down the chart and deleted everything before October 1, you would see an asset that is moving on a stable upward trajectory.

That's all a long way off, and it probably ought to be, as the current volatility could really screw things up for an individual.\n\nI think that all of these are possible in the future, which is why I think that BTC can easily shoot up another 1000%.  But so long as people get paid into bank accounts and have bank loans and other financial industry products like insurance, and taxes to pay, they're going to want a lot of their cash in, well, cash.\n\nI don't see what the immediate disaster is if bitstamp went away.

If you are not familiar with moving averages, they are those lines that are on the graph when you load bitcoinwisdom. They represent the average the price has been over different periods, in btc trading 10 and 21 are very popular choices to use because of something called Goomba's journal. The periods are based on whatever time interval you are looking at which is why it will change if you move from 1 hr to 1 day or 2 hrs to 30 mins, etc... The 10 line averages the price for the last 10 periods, the 21 for the last 21. This indicates trend refersal because if the 10 crosses the 21 this means that in the last ten periods the price has been lower than it has for the last 21, etc. \n\nThe MACD uses these and charts the diveragance between the two lines. So when the MACD crosses what this means is that the distance between the moving averages has started to decline. When it crosses into negative territory (it has its own graph at the bottom if you didn't catch that) the moving averages have actually crossed).\n\nYou should know that these are not expected to work all the time. In fact, they are supposed to work less than 50% of the time. About 60% of the trades that will be triggered if using moving averages will lose you money, however not much because if it was wrong it will also re-trigger another trade in the opposite direction if it was wrong.

But I still have a lot of questions anyway.  Looking at a 15Min interval chart of Gox, the only time the volume reached the 2500 BTC level you're talking about was in the deepest part of the weekend correction.  So I'll assume you're talking about the trade happening right then (same with bitstamp).  Correct me if I'm wrong.\n\n1. How do you know it was just one person that was selling the coins?  Was it really just one large Market order that happened all at once and took out the order book? because I don't see that in the charts.\n\n2. What would a whale's motivation be for selling all of that BTC?  How would that motivation tie into market manipulation?  \n\n3.  Putting motivation aside, even if this was just one whale dumping 2500 BTC on MtGox and then doing the same on BitStamp, how is that market manipulation?  What rules did he break?\n\nMay I pose a different hypothesis?  Gox peaked at around $1230, and Bitstamp peaked around $1160.  a 10% cut from those highs would be about 1100 and 1040 respectively.  You'll notice that when both of those exchanges hit those 10% cut marks from the ATH's, there was a brief but strong initial selloff.  The market held through that initial selloff though and maintained the levels for a little while longer before reaching the point of the biggest selloff.  Once the prior selloff low was breached, the selloff accelerated rapidly until it again was exhausted.\n\nWhat I believe was happening in both of those moments is that trailing stop loss orders were being triggered.  10% is the threshold for calling a market movement a correction, and typically once a bitcoin correction exceeds 10%, it ramps quickly.  As the first 10% reduction happened, the stop loss orders kicked in and pushed the price way down, but the market was ready to buy up those coins and the initial fall was stifled.  But that exhausted a lot of money on the sidelines too, so when the price dipped back down again, it started hitting more trailing stop losses, which quickly forced the price down again, much further than before because a lot of the pent up demand had been exhausted in the prior fall.  \n\nBasically, what I'm proposing is that a lot of the downside selling pressure we see when the price falls quickly is not actually a whale selling, but trailing stop loss orders getting executed at the market to stop the losses for larger traders.  \n": 5, 'Today?

Day traders never go to bed holding a position.  You do not have enough money to "trade."  The fees will kill you.\n\nSo, practice on paper.  A lot.\n\nThen practice some more.  Paper losses will hurt you a lot less.\n\nTrack every trade.  Why did you do it.  What happened.  How would you change it.  Screen shot every trade chart.  Analyze your results.\n\nPractice some more.\n\nThen play with money.': 13, 'No. Keep doing it. In fact, invest another $100 KNOWING that you\'re going to fuck up and lose it somehow, and keep track of the various ways that the market screws you (remember, the market is not "neutral"; it actively wants to reallocate your money). Then learn each time it happens.\n\nJust keep letting yourself lots bits and pieces of money here and there and LEARN every time things go wrong, and you\'ll get a lot better.': 5, ">Should I quit?\n\nThere must be hundreds of people asking themselves this same question.  Tonight (+8 GMT) is a case in point with the huge movement we've seen.  If you were one of the bulls howling at the moon blindly, maybe you've been too emotionally invested from a trading perspective.  Emotion will unfortunately lead you astray.  No one here 'knows' what's going to happen next, and god knows us bears get a beating when we suggest some caution, but there do exist some fundamentals that will help sharpen your strategy if you continue to trade.  People have already pointed some things out in this thread, but I'll summarise some of my own;\n\n* Know your limits not just financially, but in all things, not least of which is time.  When this rally started I definitely let myself give too much time to trading.  I don't regret having done it, and I've absorbed a massive amount of information as a result, but I recognised that this couldn't continue if I'm to give ample attention to the other things I have going on.\n\n* Be honest about your performance, and if you recognise a behaviour that has cost you too much of any of the above (time, money, etc.) then find a way to correct it.  The more you analyse your trades, the more information you have to improve upon.  The same applies to your psychology toward trading outcomes and approach.\n\n* Remove any emotional attachment to trading.  This is something that will have tested the best traders out there during this rally.  You can't make (or indeed lose!) this kind of money and not have an emotional response to it.  Work on a methodology that has data to back it up, and removes emotional interference to your trades.\n\n* Forget about finding tops and bottoms and focus on profits.  This is something I took a little while to adjust to having been lucky enough early on to call top and bottom when shorting.  Soon enough I got ahead of myself and got burnt.  You don't need to be making all of the available profit all of the time, you just need to be consistent.  Consistent wins over losses a successful trader make.\n\n* If you're not enjoying it, stop.  You've already noted that you've learnt a great deal from the experience, and if this outweighs any financial aspect for the time being, I imagine you should continue.  You undoubtedly have much to learn (I know I do), and it's obviously something that interests you.  What if's shouldn't factor anywhere in your thinking, they are nothing but dead weight.  You lost $100, no big deal.  Look for the positive and decide based on what you find whether or not this is something you want to keep giving a) time, and b) money to, in that order.\n\nAnybody who possesses a curious and analytical approach will potentially find a natural attraction to trading, just as in poker.  It requires a thought out methodical and unwavering application of mind to function at a high level, and the more you apply the theory the more consistent you become.": 13, "I've found that learning to deal with the emotions you are describing *is* what is hard about day trading. If you can master those, you will be successful. \n\nRecommended read:\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Psychology-Trading-Techniques-Minding/dp/0471267619": 1, "It's a gamble surely?\n\nLike what happened today...saw price going down down down, so sold. at a loss. then it shot back up again almost as soon as I clicked BUY!\n\nIrritated I was.": 2, 'Some great advice in this thread. Just wanted to add that the best way to learn about life and stuff is by DOING. And you DID. Now whether to keep on or not, is one question, but you\'ve obviously learnt a lot about the ruthlessness of markets and how things work - and without losing much at all. *Nothing* can beat that.\n\nI personally would invest a little more right now but just put it in cold storage. So "buy and hold". Because you\'ll regret it if the market continues to go up and you weren\'t in it.\n\nAnd then maybe trade "on paper" just for the fun of it to see how you would\'ve gone. But 99% you wouldn\'t beat the current buy and hold growth rate... but you might still improve and do better than break-even. :-)': 2, 'I have had almost the exact same situation. I have been trading on plus500 for a few months now and mainly been trading with bit coins. At first i did very well and made \xc2\xa35,000, but kept selling then re buying.

Even if there is a great opportunity to profit, like right now with China news. Even if Bitcoin crashes to $1. And then reevaluate your priorities and either cash out, simply buy&hold, continue trading on paper, or continue trading with money you can lose.\n\nAlso, money management. Never have more than 5% of your funds tied in one trade. When you lose, recalculate your new 5%, so that you lose less and less money. Or simply halve your trade size after each loss, or have a cool-down period of two days, whatever works for you. Whatever you do, once you hit a losing streak, don\'t increase the size of your trades (and thus increase risk) to "win back losses" - that\'s the recipe to increase losses.\n\nMany great traders lost tens of thousands of dollars learning how to trade before they started winning. It\'s up to you to determine if you can be profitable or not, and how much time and money you\'re prepared to spend learning. And remember, in trading money is not money - money is just tokens. If you can\'t detach from it, and constantly think how much you\'re earning or losing, you\'ll go bonkers.': 3, 'Margin trading.

I try very hard to stick with my checklist to avoid hasty/greedy decisions.\n\nEarly yesterday, I caught myself getting in that frenzy mentality that\'s easy to do in these flash dips.  I pulled the trigger and made a large sell before running down my checkoffs.  At this point, I literally wrote a post-it note that said, "That was foolish!" and stuck it on the monitor.

You talk the talk like a seasoned adult trader. Taking a little time off might not hurt, but you might be fine to stay in the game. Only you can be the judge of your ability to trade objectively. You have the knowledge and tools; you just have to make what you know are the right moves, even when hope and fantasy wants to do otherwise.\n\nI personally find poker to be a great learning tool when it comes to developing the psychology for good trading. I play on sealswithclubs, much lower stakes than where I trade. I find that even in a nickle dime game, losing pisses me off and winning is intoxicating.

Double-tops are as much of psychology as they are a pattern, and one thing bitcoin definitely does have in common with other commodities and stocks is the psychology of people behind it.\n\nVolume has thinned out and there is a good deal of sell support forming, plus we are at a high enough price point that a trend reversal would not be unprecedented.\n\nAnother interesting thing to note is China's price has been surpassed by Gox and is being caught up to by Stamp. Its clear that they are no longer driving the price at the current moment, and only time will tell if they will continue to do so in the near future.

I'd be more optimistic of a sell off if we hadn't been flat after a sell off just around a week ago today.

I think at this rate its likely we'll continue seeing drops and recoveries until it gets low enough after enough time (around a week?) that people stop thinking its a correction and start fully believing in it being a trend reversal/crash.

Not that it probably won\'t, or should not, but that it *could* not. He also claims that circulation doesn\'t exist (in what, likely, is an attempt to dispel the idea of the "velocity of money"). I do not agree with either of these points, especially the first since we have first-hand evidence today of miners gaining wealth by mining.\n\nI believe that the velocity of money is a valid idea and that a higher velocity implies a healthier economy as goods and services are bought in higher frequency. Deflationary currencies (especially one that is outright designed from the start to be ultimately deflationary) encourage spending habits that inhibits this velocity. Austrian economists tend to not buy into the velocity theory and so I can see why they believe that deflation isn\'t inhibitory of economic growth.': 2, 'Consistent deflation really should not have a long term effect on consumption.
