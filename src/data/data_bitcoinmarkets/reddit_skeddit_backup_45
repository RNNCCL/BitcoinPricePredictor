I mentioned yesterday that it all seems too precarious for me to commit and I still generally feel that way, but with the couple bounces we have not staying below 775...gives me enough confidence that I can see it breaking above $800 again. Probably not long term, but Gox hit $829 the night before last and then $837 overnight last night. \n\nYou look at the charts and the 6h+ still looks like we could fall back, but the 30min, 1hr, and 2hr tells me that it could be a fun afternoon/evening. Couple this with the general market sentiment as I read it, and in the very short term as we sit here around $775, bouncing to $800 or $825 seems a lot more likely than actually falling through $750. Then again I don\'t fuck around with these shorter term trends much if at all, I\'m open to critique. \n\nI think the activity of the last few days is a perfect indicator of just how important China is, and why it makes me shake my head and chuckle when people say "China doesn\'t matter!

Money laundering shouldn\'t be too hard to combat with strict KYC/AML requirements, but I seriously cannot fathom how they can control capital flight. Maybe not allow exchanges to xfer BTC to addressed that are not "green listed" as Chinese addresses? Have all Chinese merchants who want to accept BTC register their address with a central repository of addresses? That\'s the only way I can see them effectively keeping *most* BTC in the country -- make a bottleneck in that a valid exchange is the only place one can buy BTC, and don\'t allow that exchange to transfer to private wallets, only to registered merchant accounts/other CNY exchanges. \n\nBut if that were implemented, then *why* would a Chinese person even buy or use BTC? \n\nI just have this eerie feeling that the Party will clamp down on BTC a lot harder than we\'ve seen, but they let it get out of hand without fully understanding it, and now want to reign it in but don\'t want to completely yank the rug out from under their people.

Then, probably some 80-90% switched to FPGAs before the ASICs. Now we know ASICs dominate the market.\n\nIf we can track this trend over time, take an average of the leap in technology, how many BTC were mined (so far) at each of these transition points, we might be able to get a picture of the cost of all mining (so far).\n\nWould that give a better picture?": 2, 'I think you are getting close.

Let's pick some middle-of-the-road equipment and assume it is profitable for only 1 month.\n\nThe Avalon Mini costs $3,160 and does 60 GH/s. Let's say it's only profitable for 1 month. So that's going to cost you $52.66 per GH/s. That translates to an SMV of $40.48 per BTC.

You don't have anywhere near half your investment back because hash rate has increased every few days. In fact, if hash rate keeps growing, you will never repay your miner with the bitcoin you produce. Let alone electricity.\n\nYou might then hold your bitcoin and price increases, then console yourself with a profit on paper. Ignore the fact that if you had simply bought bitcoin, you would have been further ahead.\n\nThis is the tale that many miners have told. If you want to take the risk, you are more than welcome.

If everyone, like you said, was CPU mining on crappy old hardware then the network hashrate would be much lower. IT wouldn't matter it it was $50,000 per GH\\s when the network hashrate is so small. Remember, the increase in technological advancement is only to increase your marginal rate of mining bitcoins over everyone elses, the # of Bitcoin generated will still stay the same over time.\n\nI'd actually argue the cost of producing them has INCREASED over time because of the vast cost of designing and producing all of this specialized ASIC hardware. CPU's have already been designed and optimized and most people already own one. If we still had CPU mining we'd see alot more of a decentralization of the hash power (not talking about pooled mining), and probably a lower overall cost and higher # of different people mining on their own hardware instead of going out and buying specialized GPU's and now ASIC's to do that. \n\nIt's similar to what we see with the alt-coins when the BTC difficulty skyrocketed, alot of people moved over there because it was far more profitable.": 15, 'I would have do some "self-education\'" on the mining process.\n\nI know in the old days when I was doing capital planning I would have to do an IRR of at least 15% before I could get anything approved.\n\nI would ask, in the simplest terms, what does it cost?  What will it cost in terms of increased recurring expenses, maintenance, and additional personnel.  Then what is my return.  How is that measured and how "real" is the increased revenues or "savings."  And for how long?\n\nI would do a sliding scale of available Bitcoin\'s to be mined, and a conservative estimate of their vale.  That would include smoothing the several peaks.\n\nOnce that is done, you have to do some educated guessing about long term adoption.\n\nFinally, I am assuming you are using seven years based on an IRS depreciation table.  That is what the accountants are going to let you use.

Still seems very low, compared to the current trading price of BTC.\n\nPerhaps what is missing here is that the historical efficiency of producing BTC was extremely low before modern ASIC miners. So of the 12 million BTC mined so far, a large chunk of it was mined very expensively. \n\nSo let's take the cost based on an extremely inefficient CPU miner. Let's say you get 10 MH/s doing CPU mining on a old rusty $500 PC. That is 0.01 GH/s. So that's about $50,000 per GH/s. Total mining cost would be 9.3 mil x $50k = $465,000,000,000. Divide that by total BTC so far 12.1 mil = $38,429 per BTC.\n\nOkay, so if everyone was CPU mining only on crappy hardware, BTCs would cost a LOT of money per mining cost. \n\nNobody really mines on CPU anymore so that number is sort of useless. \n\nSo we know the price is between $0.10 per BTC and $38,429 per BTC.

You\'ll still need to test out the order execution code with live trades but you want to be able to at least test the *strategy* without live trades.\n\nOne of the biggest issues I\'ve had in practice is the exchanges themselves and their API\'s. They are buggy, sometimes serve stale data, fail in unpredictable ways, etc. Most of the magic is in trying to come up with heuristics to catch and handle the bad data. They also rate limit generally at around 5 seconds, so forget about any HFT strategies.\n\nI won\'t comment on what strategies to implement. I\'m not an expert on TA so others may be able to offer more. It has been profitable for me, though not tremendously so, and it takes a lot of tweaking to get there.

However, at this time TA, Bitcoin, and bots do not play well.\n\nTA as but one tool among many in the arsenal of a talented day trader, on the other hand, can most definitely do well with Bitcoin. At that point it is more about the trader than the TA, though. That trader will have chosen their indicators and parameters intuitively, will be adjusting them constantly, and will be selectively ignoring signals left, right and centre. All things which would greatly complicate a bot, for starters, and which will make it overfit history even more, to finish it off. They will also be taking into account all sorts of market factors which are essentially invisible to a piece of code. The more powerful the bot, the more severe the overfit against history. The more severe the overfit, the worse it will perform going forward.

Specifically, you may be losing money or may be making money but will almost surely be losing effective-BTC and falling behind buy and hold.\n\nEven just exploring the questions you posed in your reply could take huge effort and will just produce more overfit, particularly combining indicators.\n\nOn the specific topic of clouds I have two related comments. 1. They show up awfully selectively. Check back on some later to see how well they continued to do. 2. It takes very few degrees of freedom to overfit BTC history. Even very simple very conservative algos with very few degrees of freedom overfit. Clouds have, what, four or so degrees of freedom? Overfit city. Combining indicators, as mentioned before? Yet more degrees of freedom, each amplifying overfit.\n\nAs for what you _could_ automate: have lots of money to throw at the market? If so then you could easily code up a bot to trade the spread, or with some more work you could run arbitrage. I didn't have that kind of money or I would have done so. There would have been far less and far simpler code involved.": 2, "So what you're saying is that BTC-e randomly decides to change the limit amount that you buy/sell Bitcoins for?

I have run millions to tens of millions of automated backtests _per week_ for most of the last year. I have learned what I think are a good many solid lessons about the application of TA and the potential for building bots to trade Bitcoin. No single post here could hand all of that information over, but the short version is this: you aren\'t going to beat buy-and-hold, not over time and not unless you are an extremely talented and extremely committed day trader, or have enough money to throw around that you can do whale-style pump and dump and/or automate trading of the spread, run large-scale arbitrage, etc.\n\nThe slightly longer version would let you know that even the simplest of algorithms will overfit history and not generalize towards the future. This may tempt you to develop more advanced algorithms, and in backtesting they will appear to perform better, but all they will have done is overfit history even more and their future performance will be even worse. The core problem is that Bitcoin has too short a history, one that has moved (and will move!) through too many phases of price behavior, and is too volatile for TA. Too much price movement on far too little volume. Bitcoin will become more amenable to TA over time, but we are talking about today and it has a lot of further phases of behavior to go through, not the least of which is likely to be S-curve style adoption.\n\nIn the meantime, the guys tossing around EMA crossovers have obviously not backtested them.

The guys tossing around parabolic SAR have obviously not backtested it (heck, half the time they haven\'t even looked at their own posted chart images!) The guys tossing around RSI, %R, and any of their relatives have obviously not backtested them. The guys tossing around any indicators that use volume as one of their inputs have obviously not backtested them. I could go on for days but it would be a waste of time and those guys would just keep parroting their indicators. It gets funnier because they do so while all the time never stating the parameters that they use for them. These guys are just running with defaults from their charting sites, many of which differ on a site by site basis, and jiggling around their chart period until something "fits."

If you are happy with the result then congrats and keep doing it while see if you can make any improvements. If not then reevaluate and see if you can find any flaws or restart from square one.\n\nAs for polling and latency, it will be up to you. In general it will be good to be fast but most of the time, the cost of it is just too much. Only you can find an optimal price and speed.

Most assumptions made by indicators assume this is true.\n\nIt isn\'t.\n\nPrice distribution is leptokurtotic, which is just a fancy way of saying "not a random walk", where the mean of the curve is way higher than it should be, and the "tails" are far too lumpy to fit the normal distribution. This means that moves away from the mean are so frequent, they destroy the one-in-millions chances of what the normal curve would assume.\n\nAlso, price has "memory". Most people suspect it, but there\'s a way to actually prove it. The Hurst Exponent is a way to calculate persistence of changes in a data series. It was originally developed to track the height of the Nile river, to figure out the variance and pump that into another hydrological model to figure out how high a dam should be to handle the rare extremes.\n\nWhat this means is, if you have a data series that has a Hurst Exponent of greater than 0.5, you have a \'memory\' effect happening, which implies that what happened before is important to what happens later. Price data is above this value, which confirms what every trader suspects. You can test this by taking a data series and scrambling the sequence of changes, which will yield an exponent of 0.5 - which means any subsequent change has now been reduced to utter chaotic randomness.\n\nAnyway, TA is valuable and not for the reasons of being a herd-contrarian betting on people playing a MACD cross or a particular divergence in RSI.\n\nThis doesn\'t stop people from trashing it, but then again most idiots can\'t help themselves, since they haven\'t put in the time to understand why it may appear to be unsuccessful.\n': 5, 'Because I can trade them for BTC daily and make more profit than litecoins, based on current difficulty': 14, "If the majority of speculators are trading based on TA, then pretty frequently you'll see the market follow TA to some degree.

Calculating profit in BTC makes it easier to tell whether you are outperforming "buy and hold", which I think is *the* strategy to benchmark against in BTC.': 1, '>The average flair user account is 2.44 years old, has 4,917 comment karma and 1,983 link karma.\nwat.': 3, "**2. /u/testname33 (+164.46%)**\n\n    1\t2013-12-30 05:30:17\tbull\t506.9054 USD\t0.6363 BTC\t$796.6104/BTC\n    2\t2013-12-27 21:14:59\tbear\t0.6482 BTC\t506.9054 USD\t$785.1540/BTC\n    3\t2013-12-27 07:43:57\tbull\t513.3124 USD\t0.6482 BTC\t$788.7300/BTC\n    4\t2013-12-27 00:50:53\tbear\t0.6318 BTC\t513.3124 USD\t$815.7000/BTC\n    5\t2013-12-26 21:35:02\tbull\t510.0186 USD\t0.6318 BTC\t$803.9950/BTC\n    6\t2013-12-26 20:14:10\tbear\t0.6229 BTC\t510.0186 USD\t$818.8000/BTC\n    7\t2013-12-23 21:17:46\tbull\t423.5621 USD\t0.6229 BTC\t$680.0000/BTC\n    8\t2013-12-19 06:52:35\tbear\t0.7075 BTC\t423.5621 USD\t$601.1064/BTC\n    9\t2013-12-19 05:13:09\tbull\t417.7325 USD\t0.7075 BTC\t$588.1000/BTC\n    10\t2013-12-18 09:35:12\tbear\t0.7489 BTC\t417.7325 USD\t$560.0000/BTC\n    11\t2013-12-18 09:05:28\tbull\t410.4227 USD\t0.7489 BTC\t$548.0000/BTC\n    12\t2013-12-17 06:08:30\tbear\t0.5719 BTC\t410.4227 USD\t$720.5000/BTC\n    13\t2013-12-17 04:49:56\tbull\t401.8970 USD\t0.5719 BTC\t$699.9000/BTC\n    14\t2013-12-16 05:12:28\tbear\t0.4466 BTC\t401.8970 USD\t$900.0000/BTC\n    15\t2013-12-13 21:03:39\tbull\t399.1172 USD\t0.4466 BTC\t$890.2000/BTC\n    16\t2013-12-13 10:33:29\tbear\t0.4145 BTC\t399.1172 USD\t$966.7150/BTC\n    17\t2013-12-12 16:11:59\tbull\t368.9204 USD\t0.4145 BTC\t$890.0000/BTC\n    18\t2013-12-10 06:12:15\tbear\t0.3946 BTC\t368.9204 USD\t$935.0000/BTC\n    19\t2013-12-07 19:51:03\tbull\t280.4755 USD\t0.3946 BTC\t$708.0000/BTC\n    20\t2013-12-07 11:01:18\tbear\t0.3858 BTC\t280.4755 USD\t$730.0000/BTC\n    21\t2013-12-07 07:33:55\tbull\t251.7485 USD\t0.3858 BTC\t$650.0000/BTC\n    22\t2013-12-07 01:57:16\tbear\t0.3434 BTC\t251.7485 USD\t$736.0000/BTC\n    23\t2013-12-06 19:12:16\tbull\t302.5510 USD\t0.3434 BTC\t$877.4620/BTC\n    24\t2013-12-06 17:59:17\tbear\t0.3087 BTC\t302.5510 USD\t$984.1000/BTC\n    25\t2013-12-06 00:13:10\tbull\t343.3843 USD\t0.3087 BTC\t$1108.0000/BTC\n    26\t2013-12-05 14:59:21\tbear\t0.3177 BTC\t343.3843 USD\t$1085.1000/BTC\n    27\t2013-12-05 11:10:56\tbull\t320.5992 USD\t0.3177 BTC\t$1005.0100/BTC\n    28\t2013-12-04 21:07:23\tbear\t0.2630 BTC\t320.5992 USD\t$1224.0000/BTC\n    29\t2013-12-04 18:02:08\tbull\t317.0406 USD\t0.2630 BTC\t$1200.7500/BTC\n    30\t2013-12-04 15:29:05\tbear\t0.2669 BTC\t317.0406 USD\t$1188.0050/BTC\n    31\t2013-12-03 01:50:30\tbull\t289.4045 USD\t0.2669 BTC\t$1080.1100/BTC\n    32\t2013-12-02 20:42:17\tbear\t0.2717 BTC\t289.4045 USD\t$1069.4650/BTC\n    33\t2013-12-02 20:32:18\tbull\t289.4519 USD\t0.2717 BTC\t$1061.1000/BTC\n    34\t2013-12-02 20:18:19\tbear\t0.2706 BTC\t289.4519 USD\t$1069.8290/BTC\n    35\t2013-12-01 17:57:55\tbull\t290.7157 USD\t0.2706 BTC\t$1074.5000/BTC\n    36\t2013-11-21 20:04:59\tbear\t0.4053 BTC\t290.7157 USD\t$720.1050/BTC\n    \nI'm not going to tip myself, because that would be silly.

This came completely out of left-field, as is common on the Bitcoin rollercoaster.\n\nHowever, the activity from the market that day certainly factored into the indicators' calculation going forward, and provides useful information. The incredible rise in value during the next week produced a huge warning of a bulge in the Mass Index chart (bottom of the image, large orange circle), indicating a very unusual time of activity for the market, and coming out of the bulge (crossing the orange 27 and blue 26.5 lines on the way back down) signaled a possible reversal (either sideways or downward) in the market trend - which is exactly what happened. Luckily for new investors, that only meant that the market went sideways for a day or so before continuing an upward surge.\n\nIn this sort of situation, using your best judgement is key. Again, TA requires flexibility for such occurrences.

We get a couple weeks full of small bits of positive news, the price slowly climbs.\n\n\nThis doesn't mean TA is worthless and won't have more of an impact in the future. In 2015, the technical analysis of the past, present, and future price predictions could serve to make us all much wealthier! \n\n2014, however, is the year that decides if Bitcoin succeeds or fails, and is therefore much more news-driven. In the meantime, I have no objections to learning. If you want to create some threads to teach users about how to properly technically analyze bitcoin, go for it! I would, however, like to avoid turning the forum into a tealeaf reading contest before it is time to do so.": 2, '7: my favorite; parabolic SAR': 2, 'Nathanael, you weren\'t "ripped apart" and people aren\'t necessarily "hostile" toward TA. No one hates TA. Don\'t be so sensitive. Use this as a learning experience to try to understand why you got the comments you got. \n\nThe reason your thread had a lot of negative responses is because you are looking at price predictions from a completely 1 dimensional view. When you use **only** the graph to try to determine where the graph is going to go in the future, you are not using all the tools at your disposal. You\'re, in essence, saying "The road has been straight for 5 miles so it will continue to be straight for 5 more miles." However, your eyes are closed because you can\'t see the road ahead.\n\nWhen you then share your 1 dimensional analysis with everyone else and give no sound reasoning for your prediction other than having looked at the graph, people are going to disagree with you because EVERYONE has their OWN idea where the price will go, and if your prediction doesn\'t line up perfectly with theirs, well you can see what happens.\n\n**TL\'DR:** TA is a **tool** to be used along with sound reasoning, the current worldview on bitcoin, recent news from various countries, and about 50 other tools you can think of on your own.

[Here\'s the original link with editable parameters.](http://bitcoincharts.com/charts/bitstampUSD#rg60zig6-hourzczsg2013-11-06zeg2014-01-05ztgSza1gSMAzm1g5zm2g25zxzi1gMACDzi2gMDXzi3gRSIzi4gUOzvzl) Don\'t worry about not understanding everything right now, as there is a lot going on here. Bookmark it and see how it looks to you in a couple weeks\' time.\n\nIndicators used here:\n\n>SMA: Simple Moving Average\n\n>MACD: Moving Average Convergence-Divergence\n\n>Mass Index\n\n>RSI: Relative Strength Index\n\n>Ultimate Oscillator\n\n[The first chart](http://i.imgur.com/wCbNvMA.png) is the price data of BTC to USD on BitStamp from 11/2013 to 01/2014. The prices are shown as candlesticks, green being increases and red being decreases in price over each 6-hour period. The black curvy line over these candlesticks is the 5-day Simple Moving Average. This simply shows the historical trend (meaning, it shows where the price has been on average, to confirm retrospectively an uptrend or downtrend). The bars shown all along the bottom of the chart are volume bars - how much money was involved in that 6-hour period to make that increase or decrease in price.\n\n[The next chart shown](http://i.imgur.com/mAMKmgd.png) is another moving average indicator: the Moving Average Convergence-Divergence indicator, or MACD. This indicator is a momentum indicator. It tells us how fast the price is rising or falling, and can help us follow a trend. In the example around December 1st, we can see a very strong downward momentum begin, which continued until December 9th. The blip of weak upward momentum on December 5th/6th showed that even though the price began to make back some of its gains lost on the 1st, the movement wasn\'t well-fueled and didn\'t hold for long, falling strongly thereafter. (More details on this in the future Moving Averages post.)\n\n[Under the MACD chart](http://i.imgur.com/BYgrZ8I.png), we have the Mass Index indicator, a volatility indicator that lacks a bias of direction. Simply put, you can\'t tell if the price is rising, falling or sideways based on this indicator, but you can tell how volatile the current market activity is. This is used to predict trend reversals based on when the curved line breaks the 26.5 and 27 lines. Note how Bitcoin\'s unusual volatility pushed the line all the way up to 33 around November 10th! That\'s what we call the Bitcoin rollercoaster. (More details on this indicator in the future Mass Index/Volatility post.)\n\n[Below these are the last two indicators](http://i.imgur.com/ymdZ7Wn.png), the RSI (Relative Strength Index) and Ultimate Oscillator (fun name). Both of these can be used to determine buying pressure, and to determine if the market is overbought/oversold. Notice that Almost all of the November month was in the red "overbought" territory above the 70 line on both of these indicators. That is the insane amount of buying occurring that drove up the price during the month. Following into December, we see the index drop back between 30 and 70, meaning there was far less buying activity by comparison, and even a dip into oversold territory around December 18th/19th. (Again, these will be revisited in detail in the future RSI post).\n\nI will revisit each of these indicators in future posts, as I would like to discuss their details such as calculation, interpretation, their individual failures, and deriving buy/sell signals from each.\n\n\n#**To Get Started With Technical Analysis**\n\nLearn how to read charts if you haven\'t already, about candlesticks, and always Google a term you see used that you\'re not familiar with. I refer you to chapters 4-6 of Technical Analysis for Dummies by Barbara Rockefeller to do this. They\'re a quick read of 50 pages or so. (I\'m not calling you a dummy of course, none of us are - it\'s just a great introduction to the basics of looking at charts, and is an absolute prerequisite to technical analysis.)\n\n**The above point is not optional.** If you don\'t know how to read candlestick charts, you will be even more clueless when you go to put moving average lines over top of those bars. To help, [here\'s a free PDF version of the book](http://www.futurestruth.com/files/Download/technical_analysis_for_dummies_2nd_edition.pdf), so you have no excuse for saying you didn\'t know when we come back next week! Your homework is to at least read Chapter 6 (from pages 93 to 112) and have enough understanding to be able to teach someone else about what you read. \n\n\n#**What You Can Read Before Next Week**\n\nIf you\'re chomping at the bit already and don\'t want to wait for next Saturday\'s post to learn about this TA stuff, I like you. [I\'ve already compiled a short list](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/wiki/guides) of what I consider to be invaluable resources for learning about technical analysis, both in books (which I\'ve even provided PDF copies of!) as well as websites that all of us should already have on our bookmarks bar. They\'re available on the /r/BitcoinMarkets Wiki (in the Knowledgebase sidebar) under "Guides, Strategies and Indicators."\n\n\n**Disclaimer:** My own predictions are not to be taken as trading advice, and I am not responsible for the losses or gains of anyone who uses the information I\'ve posted. I\'m not an active daytrader, nor am I certified or hold a degree in any market-related field. I\'m a 23 year old college grad, IT guy and music producer with a curiosity in Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies, and Forex trading. I am self-taught out of the resources I\'ve quoted from in this post as well as numerous investing/trading websites, and started learning technical analysis in 2012, having only put serious research and implementation of TA into my investing mid-2013. I use technical analysis in my occasional trading, and do have thousands of dollars on the line on any given day - so I have faith in TA. \n\nMy information is not infallible, and I am not the most learned person in the field. What I am is curious and attempting to be well read on the subject, that I may help others do the same. I\'m looking to help you teach yourself, so if you learn from me, I\'ll be surprised - but if you learn from the resources I\'ve linked and summarized, I\'ll be happy.\n\n\xe2\x80\x95\n\nThank you, and best of luck. Make money, spend wisely, see you next week.': 39, 'Oh! You meant you were looking for a TL;DR of the chart example post.\n\nWell, there\'s simply no way to shorten that information. What I mean is, each of those indicators has a function and a purpose that sets it apart from the others. I can\'t simply say "when this indicator crosses this line it means this in every situation, and when this one curves like this it means this every time." It doesn\'t work that way. If you don\'t know what exactly they\'re telling you, you can\'t make the decisions necessary to make them useful indicators in your trading plan.\n\nIf it were that easy, I wouldn\'t need to be doing a weekly review series. :) I\'ll try to keep my posts more concise and to the point in the future, but there will always be some degree of reading commitment required to get the full picture of technical analysis. \n\nThere\'s no rushing that\'s worth misunderstanding when your money is on the line.': 1, 'Just doing my part. :)': 4, 'More players means more volume, and more volume means fewer opportunities for strong hands to individually manipulate the market.

People follow patterns (not always, but at the end of the day they will follow a routine or common way of thinking and behaving), and groups of people are no different. \n\nWhen there are people involved in the same trading scenario, like investors buying BTCs to hold them, they can be duped into pump-and-dump schemes or be scared out of their positions by falsely generated FUD (fear, uncertainty and doubt) in media outlets and online communities. Increase the population of those average investors, and it becomes more difficult to scare enough people or dupe them into schemes. It still happens, but the dollar amount required to make a move in the price rises, and what used to be a manipulative whale is now just another mediocre player in the market.\n\nTechnical analysis relies on patterns to give us meaningful signals, and the increase in trader and investor population (therefore, an increase in volume) means groups will follow their patterns more closely, because if that's what makes them money, that's what they'll continue to do.

Because this market will sway with such intensity and magnitude that it will test our emotional integrity to great extents. A lot of people will buy high and sell low and get sick of the incontrovertible 'market manipulation' that occurs. However, those who truly understand the concept of crypto will hold on through the shit storms that at times devalue the currency more than 300% of its 7day peaks. My advice to everyone is that it is impossible for all of you to sit in front of the computer watching paint dry on craptsy or mtgox or wherever it is you trade. Unless your job is day trading cryptos don't punish yourself by wavering and succumbing when the market crashes and you lose enormous amounts of your equity.

If we start the analysis from the 'point of maximum market despair' in  Oct 11, we would end up with  a much steeper curve.  Likewise, as adoption grows, we should see less deviance from the trend and a clearer view of the 'real' trend, which should look more like an 's' rather than a straight line.  Calculating the 'top of the 's' price' requires some serious assuming, but i can safely say that any price point between $100 and $100,000 puts us in the steeper section of the curve, which could explain why the slope of the blue line seems so flat right now.\n\n\n": 2, 'Mmm.

The few things I have heard suggest that the gold standard was fine, but inflationary systems soon took over as they were able to lend money, thus creating wealth and growth, leaving the old ways in the dust. However, it is my opinion that it was an experiment that would take 200 years to fail. We now seem to be at the fail point. The numbers have just got too crazy. Too much debt, too much inflation, vast inequality. I can't think of any meaningful way to sort out the current situation. Gold standard has always appealed to me ever since I learned that money is nothing but debt (in a weird bubble-like-circle). What actually is there? Nothing, just confidence. And as we see with the price of bitcoin, confidence goes up, and comes down. \n  \nI know the argument that a deflationary currency will fail because it is in each individual's interest to hoard, not spend, inhibiting the economy. I know this is true of me. I have deliberately not tipped people with bitcoin here, because I think i'm tipping with a future fortune. In fact I cashed out my $9 of tips for $70-90 dollars recently. \n\nHowever. I'm not somebody that thinks bitcoin needs to be a currency, soon, in order to succeed. I see the 'currency' aspect as a 'second phase' (and bonus to a secure store-of-wealth) which may be many years off. \n\nAlso, as I said above. It might be that as a deflationary nears it's maximum value (even if it's only 80% there) the problems of deflation actually melt away.

Refreshing to see in the ocean of TA we swim through every day on this sub.\n\nPeople are waking up to Bitcoin at a seemingly exponential rate. My grandfather, sitting in a retirement home at 93 years of age, knows what Bitcoin is--and not from me. People came together during the holidays, and those interested in Bitcoin spread the word--I know that I, personally, have 4 new family members looking into picking up some coins in 2014. I'm not alone. Many made small gifts of bitcoin as well, further incentivizing these initiates to put some time into research and self-education.\n\nThis, to me, is one of the biggest factors for BTC success. Some folks are under the impression that BTC is one big Ponzi scheme, while others heard that they were used to buy drugs on the Black Market. Clearing up misconceptions and solidifying the knowledge base will ensure consumer confidence and lead more conservative investors into the market.\n\nNo doubt the MSM will continue to cover Bitcoin as it slowly becomes a household name. With their proclivity to hype up every bit of news, I expect volatility during 2014 to remain high. Fortunately, I am confident the majority of news in 2014 will be positive for Bitcoin. This should ultimately outweigh any negativity coming from China--even in the case of an outright ban. To grope at the price ranges for 2014, I'd say anywhere from $500-$3000 Stamp, ending the year much, much higher than we are now.\n\nThose are my predictions, at least.": 0, "I agree with you. My focus on consumers was simply to explore the value of merchant adoption (which we hear about a lot). I avoided the international remittance market because I worry that in a bear market it would be more expensive to use bitcoin to transfer funds (the price might drop more than 10% in the time it takes for the receiving party to sell to their local currency).

There is no incentive to sending the payment faster across seas, even if they wait until the end of their terms.  Why do you think businesses still use checks for most things?  Do consumers use checks? Not very often because consumers want something fast and instant.  Businesses do not.  They want something reliable and easily accountable.": 3, "> I find it deeply unsatisfying to read predictions that the price will increase in 2014 just because the charts are trending in that direction or because people are hopeful.

Instead of the finance department printing a check, they buy coins and send to the contractor's address on their exchange. After 6 confirmations, contractor can finally sell. This reduces some volatility, and would be as secure as the exchanges (and your finance department). But the % you could lose during those 6 confirmations could be bigger than the cost of just using fiat... we'll have to see if volatility ever gets low enough.": 2, "Maybe, but I still think that America will be the leader in bitcoins.  This has become clear over the past few months.\n\nIt's strange to think that a country where private money has been demonized in the past had such wildly optimistic hearings.

For all people complain about excessive costs and regulations, I'd rather deal with a licensed US exchange than with some exchange run out of a basement.  People starting businesses in California know what licenses they need to obtain to sell bitcoins, and that is not the case in India.\n\nThe US is where all the money is coming from.  It's where the big retailers are announcing the acceptance of bitcoins.  It's an enemy of China, which makes it difficult for any politician to do the same thing as the Chinese did.  And, unlike in China, a process of law has to be followed to ban bitcoins, and the Republicans aren't going to let anything pass in an election year, whether it be bitcoins or even any budget that does anything more than effectively be a continuing resolution.\n\nThe intelligence community has an incentive to promote bitcoins, as well.  Bitcoins are very transparent and easier to track than normal money, when you know their source.  You can fund revolutionary groups and track how they spend the money you gave them, without anyone else knowing who you are and who you are supporting.\n\nIf India or South America takes up bitcoins, they will be using services created with American funding.

Currently we are using $10 boxes, and a 3-box reversal for a column change.]\n\nhttp://imgur.com/lvxabgG\n\nToday we broke through the buy signal price of $700, and moved to a high of $764.32  The targeted bullish objective for this breakout was at the $760 mark, which we hit around 2:30 PM.  Shortly thereafter the price dropped back down the current $720 on fairly low volume.  Clearly the day traders know how to use the same charts.\n\n[The new pattern is called a "Double Top Breakout."  It is the most common bullish patten in P&F Charts.  You can read the definition here:  http://stockcharts.com/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:chart_analysis:pnf_charts:pnf_bullish_bo\n\nGenerally speaking the doubletop breakout results in an average 38% gain, 82% of the time, over 4 months.  Of course that is based on stock transactions not, whatever this thing is....]\n\nSo, we are in the midst of forming a new pattern.  The most recent current high is today\'s $764.  This breakout is bound to be weak, as the formation was fast and the break out to $764 was very fast.  Our current sell signal remains at $590.  The current resistance we must break through to reverse the current short term downward trend is $940.  The long term up trend remains where is was at $124.\n\nMy guess is that we form a new pattern at this point, bouncing between $700 and $760.\n\nHappy St Stephens day.  //sarcasm\n\nDisclaimer:  if you follow my advice, you will follow me into the poor house.  Or to the secondary ski areas in western new england.  Neither of which is a place you really want to be.  Use your own brains.  Mine clearly has something wrong with it.\n\n[Yet a third note:  On the chart you will see a square with a blue T on it.  That is where I calculated the Bullish Objective for this pattern.  There are a couple of ways to do this.  This method is calculated by taking the "width" of the formation and counting the number of columns.  In this case there were 6 columns.  Therefore, I estimated the "top" of the next rise by adding 6 boxes (one for each column) onto the box at the "buy signal."  The buy signal here was at $700.  The six boxes above that went from $710-$760.  That is how I arrived at a bullish objective of $760.  Think about it like pressure building up on a champagne cork.  The more time you shake it, up and down, the further up the cork is going to go.\n\nConsider the last triangle we had...it was twice as wide.  Therefore, the pressure for the move downward was pretty significant.  We blew out that objective and fell like a rock.\n\nThe "Objectives" do not always work, but they give you a good sense of the dynamic nature of the market. ]\n\nEdit:  Inserted the link to the double top breakout definition and the "bullish objective" explanation for anyone looking to learn more.\n\n': 13, "The average poster: The price has a 50% chance of going up, if it doesn't, then it will go down.

Then you would have $4000 of borrowed money with which to buy 4 BTC. Now every $1 rise in price earns you a $4 gain. Later you close your position by selling the 4 BTC to repay the $4000 plus interest/fees, and pocket the rest of the difference in price (which is 4x more than if you'd done your own thing).\n\nOn the downside, if you lose money you lose it 4x as quickly, and if the price dropped by $250 you would be down by an amount equal to your $1000 deposit, and then the exchange would force-sell your coins and take your deposit to recover the $4000 you owe, leaving you with nothing.

I guess if you are transferring money from Coinbase to MtGox, it is because you are planning to sell there at the higher price and don\'t mind taking the extra risk of waiting 30 days? Thanks for any help.\n\nTo my mind the only reason to trade on Gox is because so many other people are - if you go to some of the smaller exchanges, a thousand dollars might be enough to substantially move the price, meaning a large buy loses out to slippage (the last few coins costing more because you ate through the available sells and pushed the price up when you bought the first few), but on Gox you can move higher numbers without that happening.\n\nFor withdrawals, 30 days is possibly a lowball estimate (they still have my money, my last withdrawal ended in an error after a few weeks went by). So the price gets inflated either: \n\n* because the market is valuing "dollars on MtGox" as less useful than \'real\' dollars (so they\'re therefore worth less, and so it costs more of them to buy a bitcoin) \n\n* or because people are moving money out of gox by buying bitcoin to transfer, with limited regard for the loss involved (if you made a gain by earlier transferring in from another exchange, it may well balance out) which creates a steady little upward pressure to keep the price up - any time it gets close to equalising, that\'s a great time for someone to make the move to another exchange without losing much, which pushes Gox back up again...\n\nActually, those two things are basically the same thing.': 2, 'I think a statement like that belies a fundamental misunderstanding of financial risk.

Bitcoin is extremely useful in China to get around currency controls.  Exporting currency from China can cost up to 5%.\n\nRight now, if you deposit RMB onto Huobi, you can buy Bitcoins for ~4430 RMB ($730 USD).  You'll get a small 0.2% fee on the buy, then another small fee on the withdrawal.  Overall, around 0.3% for decent amounts (3 BTC+).  Now, you send that BTC from Huobi to Bitstamp, sell it for $737 (at the time of posting this).  You'll pay a fee between 0.2-0.6%.  Let's say 0.4%.  Now withdraw the money to a US bank for a small fee.  All fees combined from depositing RMB to withdrawing the USD to your bank are around 1%.  Many times, the difference in prices between the exchanges is actually higher than the fees going from RMB deposit -> USD withdrawal.\n\nWith prices right now, people can export money from China and actually earn 1-2%, or at least break even.  For amounts like $100,000 USD, this would cost the average person up to $5,000.  It can now be done for $0, or even better, for a profit.

That said I do think short term the price will go up some more before dropping (hence bullish).\n\nWe slag off TA a lot here and traditional market sentiments, but honestly the more mature the bitcoin market becomes the more and more relevant TA/traditional market movements will apply. TA and such still is no guarantee, it is simply a tool, but the tool is becoming much more accurate now than when it was early this year. We constantly mention how bitcoin market conditions now are much more mature and different than they were in previous bubbles, and I agree with this, but yet still assume the same old rules of "bitcoin has no rules" apply because of this. The bigger this market gets, the mature mature it gets, and the more serious its investors get, the more and more you are going to start seeing this behave in a manner thats hard to fudge if you happen to have a lot of money on you. Do **not** read this the wrong way - I\'m not trying to say Bitcoin is at that moment yet. I\'m just saying its much closer to being there right now than it was last year, and because of this I think TA and market psychology can have a much stronger role in taking a good position now than it ever could before.\n\nI think you guys might find that in a few months after things are "clear" that the current bubble chart will adhere surprisingly well to classical market patterns - not to an exact T, but to enough of a level to allow someone experienced in trading to recognize familiarity in the bitcoin chart, and it all has to do with buyer/seller psychology. The bubble peaked off with a double top, which often sees a recovery afterwards before continuing to drop. This is exactly what we got.\n\nThat "dreaded" bubble chart everyone hates here might actually have merit this time, since as far as I\'m aware this is the first bubble that wasn\'t instigated crash wise due to outside artificial factors, mostly market sentiment and the right amount of news to be the catalyst. If we look at that bubble chart and then look here I don\'t think its really out there to expect this rise we are currently getting to be a "return to normal". The only reason I believe this is because just look at this sub-reddit: its filled with people convinced that a real recovery will happen and we\'ll see ATH\'s again quite soon. This is the *exact* type of thinking that causes "return to normals" to happen in the first place. People see enough of a rise to be convinced that the large longer term drops were nothing more than a correction, to continue to buy in, feeding into the rise even more. \n\nIf this is in fact a "return to normal" then we might see rises continue for another week or maybe even more, until the illusion of safety is finally destroyed with it dropping down into new all time lows (in the context of the current drop).\n\nI say *if* because there isn\'t a chart on earth that follows TA to the letter, which is why its a tool not a garuntee. We could easily see this continue south right now. I think its likely, considering what the market is doing right now and the price history, and the patterns we have developed, that we will see this rise continue more before dropping to new lows. And the only reason I have any real trust in such blasphemus TA this time around is because I\'m seeing how the average user on this sub-reddit is acting - a lot of them seem convinced that this can only hit ATH\'s again soon, despite what the trends are showing in the long and mid term.': 24, 'never sold, have not bought more.\n\nstill mining.': 5, 'I have paying attention to that since 1200 USD thats when I sold my BTC.': 5, 'Just check my comment reply (directly above/below this one).\n\nTL;DR he is a terrible trader (proven by his comment history), and his post above is a lie.': 4, "I'm not a scared bear, but I was bearish after China.

The issue is that the results can be ambiguous, but it tends to at least let me know if something overall in the markets is happening. It's essentially a barometer of overall market condition since nothing is going on BUT arbitrage.\n\nFurther, I tend to look at natural patterns in when people buy, sell, when prices peak, when prices decrease. For example, the fact that price has held steady at this time of day is fairly unusual. In about 50 minutes we usually see market activity for whatever reason, usually downwards, through morning. Rinse, repeat, etc. etc. Arbitrage is also having a heavy effect on pricing in that it dampens any movement and I think increases any peak, or the abruptness thereof. These are the sudden peaks people have been seeing when an exchange flips from a sell to a buy.\n\nI'm guessing that activity that is coming up will actually increase price through 50~ minutes from now give or take a couple hours. However, I'm not confident that it will be a buy instead of a sell. So I watch.

Dodgecoin brought in a ton of new people to the Bitcoin community at the perfect time to help counter the China crash that we saw last week. Bitcoin went down, Dodgecoin up. As much as a joke as it was, it really helped things in the long run I believe. From Dodgecoin memes on facebook on subjects that aren't even related to cryptocurrencies to the Simpsons reference or the tweets from Snoop Dogg & others, I believe public awareness is starting to seep into the mainstream especially considering how much time the financial media is spending on BTC. Add to that enthusiasts are giving BTC as gifts to family and friends we're setting up some underlying market conditions for a medium to large adoption wave come the new year. Much earlier than most expected I think too.\n\nWe just broke out of a major triangle formation and are on the way upward... Slowly, barely, but it's still upward. There is also a $1M USD buy wall on mtgox at $700 preventing the price from dropping any lower. It isn't even being eaten up either, in the last 8 hours since it went up I've hardly seen any coins been taken out of it. We might get a huge panic buy from whatever whale that is if they wake up tomorrow and the order has hardly been filled.

This is represented by the blue line on BicoinWisdom. When the blue line goes to zero, that\'s when they are crossing over.\n\nOverlaying this line is a moving average of this value; it is a moving average of the differences between moving averages! I can\'t be sure what parameter you have set, but many use a 9 period moving average for this line. It is referred to as the "signal line" and is represented by the yellow line on BitcoinWisdom.\n\nThe red and green bars actually represent the difference between the difference in moving averages (blue line) and its own signal line (yellow line). This is called the MACD histogram. It\'s green (and positive) when the signal line is above the difference line and it\'s red (and negative) when it\'s below the difference line. \n\nWhen there is a hollow green bar, it means that the difference was greater than the previous period. When solid, the difference was smaller than the previous period. When, the histogram is red (negative), the opposite is true; hollow red bars indicate the difference is getting smaller and vice versa.\n\nIt\'s difficult for me to explain this without diagrams and what not, but if you are able to look at a chart for yourself as you are reading, it should make a lot more sense.\n\nWhat I would like you to take away is that fact that for the past couple of days, and all over this thread, there have been people talking about the "1d MACD crossover". Firstly I assume everyone is using the default settings on BitcoinWisdom (though you are not, which means you will likely have different results), because nobody mentions the parameters, ever. If that is the case then these people should note that it is simply the signal line that has crossed over the difference line (creating a green bar on the histogram).

Some things I think bear consideration;\n\n- The amount and number of arbitration bots seem to be expanding, hell, there are now bots on my little safe, secure, quiet, low volume slow as hell to react backwater. WTF?\n\n- I think due to the number and amount of arb between exchanges, we're seeing really weird wave forms in the buy patterns. Essentially, every single exchange is going to move in a slightly different manner, and slightly different rate, while the arb bots fight to equalize them. However, arb across exchanges are not equal so these bots are likely contributing to the issue.\n\n- I think the market patterns that emerge periodically are the result of the above. OK say if you take 5 pebbles, and throw them into a pond. They'll all land at slightly different spots at slightly different times with slightly different velocities. They will all create ripples, which are waves, much like any other wave. In any wave, there are peaks and troughs, and with multiple waves what you see is complex wave forms emerge, as the peaks and troughs interfere with each other. You'll see peaks summate to create large waves from nowhere, and trough summate to create even larger troughs, and all sorts of interference patterns. Same with electricity or sound. I think what's occurring is an interference pattern, causing overly low lows, and mysterious rises from the blue.\n\n- This is what is what, IMO, has been the reason for some of the strange patterns we see in trades this week, including those mystery rises out of nowhere on low volume, these are results of the exchanges moving in tandem in an upward direction, the very narrow bands where the price points go nuts are when the exchanges are moving in different directions. BTCE seems to be schizophrenic with multiple arb bots pulling it in different directions.\n\n- I think December was a very, very bad month, for some reasons I agree with other people, but for other reasons, disagree. I don't think this was a correction. I think these were unpriced in random events combined with specific conditions that combined to cause crashes. Hopefully this shakes out in January.\n\n- If you are a bear, you will be waiting a while IMO, to get a better buy in position. But if we agreed, I'd be one too. Obviously make your own choices.\n\nThis is my assessment of where things are going. What does tommorrow hold? No clue.

Or if it's gone down they pay me back for the amount that they've lost on my behalf. \n\nExcept they haven't *really* borrowed my funds, so 'behind the scenes', what's really happening is that we've created that contract, and *I've* chosen to move my funds into bitcoin so as to negate the risk of losing money on that contract - if I have to pay them the difference, I *have* the difference because I was notionally in bitcoin for the period in question.\n\nAnd then the whole affair is subject to a commission which looks approximately like an interest payment.

This means arbitrage (buying on one exchange while selling on another) is slow, expensive due to fees, and time value of money - you can't trade with money that is tied up in a withdraw process.  So if your withdraw takes a month, and BTC price increases 20% that month, you are losing money because you can't ride that increase.\n\nArbitrage, either manual or moreso probably automated, helps to keep inter-exchange prices similar. When you buy low at once place, it increases the market price there - then sell high at another place, it lowers the market price there. This brings the prices closer together.\n\nBut when arbitrage is hard fewer people do it... You have to calculate to know that your profit margin is big enough to cover transaction costs at both places, transfer fees, as well any potential change in value until the buy/sell cycle is fully complete. A fluctuation or delay can turn your profit margin into a loss. Thus many people avoid arbitrage - the current tools aren't mature/robust enough for it to be reliable/easy.\n\nThus, prices at different places vary on exchanges.\n\nAdditionally, there is a cost at places like Coinbase, which is not an exchange but more of a consumer/retail service. They manipulate the price ensuring their buy is always a certain margin above their sell, so it isn't as easy as just buying and selling there to make profit - the convenience they offer has that cost.\n\nBitcoinwisdom tracks price based on data the more popular exchanges make available. At the top of their site, they list the various markets, and clicking each displays all their market history upon whatever time frame you want.\n\nMarkets change.

I didn't mention news, trust in an exchange, or other factors that also affect value (if you trust a certain exchange more, you would invest more money - if you think you might get ripped off by an exchange, you might only try it if the BTC there is cheaper than anywhere else).

That\'s just a lost opportunity. Arbitrage has nothing to do with speculating in BTC, and even though history shows that just holding BTC will give you more profit than doing arbitrage (because arbitrage takes approx. 1 month), arbitrage is unique in that you don\'t take the same risk, you are just correcting the markets, and the only risk is big changes in BTC/USD while transferring BTC from one exchange to the other, which takes around 20 minutes.\n\nThe amount of time it takes to withdraw USD from for example mtgox is irrelevant, as long as you get it in the end. Of course if fees are bigger than the premium of btc-e and mtgox it wouldn\'t be beneficial, but that has not been the case as far as I know.\n\nExample:\n\nDay 1: Deposit 1000$ USD into BTC-e\nDay 4: Deposit completed, buying 1 BTC for 1000$\nDay 4: Immediately sending 1 BTC to Mt.Gox and selling 1 BTC for 1100$\nDay 4: Withdrawing 1100$ USD\nDay 30: Receiving 1100$ USD (minus international bank transfer fee(usually around 10$))\n\nRepeat.\n\nNow this might not be considered an amazing return in 1 month for some people, but bare in mind you will get the same return even with a fallen BTC-market, and this is what makes it significant.': 1, 'If you verify your credit card with CB, you can get up to 10btc instantly per day ': 2, "Keep it simple.

How do you expect mass adoption of a new currency when many MANY people don't fully understand what it is that they're using to conduct transactions?": 2, "So the exchange willfully violated your privacy by giving out your information?

If you would go for that, majority wold not be able to grasp it and/or would not be willing to invest time and effort to do so. That is why this was an innovation that 'smart' people understood first. They still do. \n\nFor wider adoption of Bitcoin you need to make people understand what you can do with it and how to use it. And make it easy. If majority of people on WS didn't get it, that is the sign, that there is still a lot of potential for growth. Once the major financial circles grasp the possibility of profit and incorporate that into their investments, picture will be different. But I think it's too early for that. I have seen few whales diving in and I am not sure they do understand fully what Bitcoin is. They maybe just have the nose for good investment or a small % of their enormous wealth that they invest into risky investments and wait.\n\nFor wider adoption between people I think we need to make it very simple. Get few celebrity to buy something with bitcoin, explain we can pay goods and services with it, no transaction fees, send it as a gift for Birthday, buy new shoes and pretty dresses (speaking from female point of view) and make it look trendy. If you get Lady Gaga to buy something and pay with Bitcoin from her mobile phone, you will have ten thousands of girls asking daddy to get them some :) When you make something trendy, and demand is created, WS professionals will start looking into it, if not before. The question is if you would rather go for adoption from the side of professionals first or get their attention by creating buzz within general population to begin with. Every new technology in the last decade at least was made popular by making it look cool, easy to use and easy accessible and affordable to general population. Mobile phones, tablets and more. \n\nWhichever way you go, the need to slim down the complicated crypto explanations is there. Without it, I don't think majority will be able to grasp and adopt Bitcoin. Also and above all I think there is the need to build more user friendly software on multiple platforms, especially on mobile one, so that people will be able to buy Bitcoins from mobile phone for example via their mobile operators. FIAT- Bitcoin process is still too complicated of average user. \n\nTo wrap it up, I would work on user friends technical solutions first, then make a buzz with proper marketing within wider population and then the majority of professionals will follow by themselves.

Fortress is immensely larger, so they have the power to get that done more quickly, but with the uniqueness of the fund and it's potential investment into BTC, the SEC will probably take additional time to consider things. I would guesstimate march or April for a fully fledge fund to be up and running, but it's a guess at best.\n\nAs for the winklevoss ETF, my stance hasn't changed. It won't be approved anytime in the near future. The SEC will sit on it until Bitcoin dies or can't be denied any longer, or until bitcoin falls under more serious regulation.": 3, "Yes, I'm familiar with that filing. They filed a form ADV, which is just an initial filing to register Pantera (the Firm) with the SEC as an investment adviser.  That is not a formal filing for a Bitcoin fund.  All investment advisers must file a form ADV with the SEC, and it mostly just covers all the details and background of the firm, including total assets, which is where the 26 Principals and $147 Million in assets figure have been culled from.  In simple terms, this is Pantera telling the SEC that they have formed an investment advisory firm, and not much more than that.": 16}}}
