Does a user have any way to prove to third parties that he is identical with the user who has a given balance indicated by the signed tree?\n\n(Just a few weeks ago in /r/crypto I was saying how bank statements are not as valuable as they could be, because you cannot prove their authenticity to third parties unless those third parties have acquired them directly from the bank -- which the bank will not allow without a court order, even if the account owner gives permission.

We actually went back and forth on whether or not to release the full merkle tree, or just allow each user access to their own partial path. In the end we decided on the partial path, primarily because with the currently available standardization tools, only the partial path and root are used. The full tree would be nice to see, but wouldn't serve any purpose. \n\nHowever, the only reason the root/cold wallet address isn't made public at this point is a design choice. By placing the Proofs within the security center on a users account it requires the user to be logged in to view. I'm sure if there was enough of a call to transparency we'd consider it. I know /u/captaincrunchhn was all for publishing everything publicly (and so I was for that matter) but after talking about it in the #bitcoin channel we came to the conclusion that it didn't give our users any added benefits. \n\n\n> Relatedly, it sounds like users could also use this mechanism to prove to their balance to third parties. \n\nYes, this additional functionality would be possible - but it is currently not present. But since you can withdraw your coin at a moments notice, if you needed to, you could also just sign your personal wallet address. However, if you needed to prove that you were synonymous with a user/balance reported by an exchange, I feel like it would be easier if the exchange simply allowed for verification on behalf on a user (something like OAuth perhaps for internet based verifications).

I don't believe in getting into debt.\n\nBut now that I don't need to worry about loans, I've actually become more interested in my credit score because the credit card offers and bank account offers you get are dependent on it.  You might find it hard to believe that every Sunday for the past few months I have had takeout from the Olive Garden without paying a dime, and I still have four $50 gift cards left.\n\nYou can get stuff like that by playing the credit card game.  I have five cards now.  You just charge stuff to the card that has the 5% rewards for that month.  In January, DISCOVER had restaurants at 5%, and now Chase does.  So I just use different cards for the same purchases.  Now, DISCOVER changed to hardware stores, so I charged all the mulch to them and I charge gas to American express, which gives 3%.  Not only that, you can increase your rewards by 20% by converting them to gift cards and selling them at face value.\n\nTo make things better, I also earned $190 for paying my taxes.  Capital One offered $200 plus 2% in travel rewards for signing up.  So I paid the IRS's 2.49% fee, put my $2200 tax bill on Capital One, and will walk away with $190 in June when the rewards mature.  Then I close the account and repeat with some other company.\n\nThis also works with banks.  My brother got a letter in the mail saying that I would get $50 if I opened an account with Nittany Bank, so he did.  He left the minimum $1000 in the account for 3 months and then closed the account.  I got a letter too, this time from Sovereign, which is offering $150.\n\nIf you manage your credit score, which essentially means that you make sure you close your unused cards after the deals expire, you can earn huge amounts of money.  A high credit score means more lucrative deals.

The algorithm, which I\'ve used successfully on paper, is to buy right after a huge panic, catching the falling knife.  Then you simply wait and be very patient, selling when the price rises enough so that you make a 5% profit after taxes.  If the price falls further, just hold and wait until it rises again to the 5%, because it always has.  There has yet to be a case where this is a losing strategy because bitcoins have always regained losses after these panics.  It takes patience, however, because it could be hours, or weeks, until you actually sell.  If you follow this strategy, get impatient, and sell out because you think you can buy back in lower, you\'ll lose money.\n\n2.  I\'m going to hold off on altcoin updates for the next few days.  I discovered on Saturday that, while mining is profitable now, designed hard forks also occur frequently in altcoins, making it very time-consuming to stay up to date with the latest versions of the daemons.  Good thing I figured it out now.\n\n3.  The best thing about the pool is that we have, at one-minute granularity: difficulties, prices, block rewards, expected payouts per 1Mh, number of miners, and several other metrics for 40 altcoins of scrypt, SHA-256, and others, with a greater number of coins to come.  The data is collected for the algorithm that assigns the proportion of pool miners to each coin.  However, this data is useful for more than just assigning proportions of the hashrate to coins.  It must be useful for trading decisions and even for development activities.  I\'m interested in people\'s thoughts as to what sort of charts showing correlations between all this data would be useful to people here.  For example, there are some interesting correlations I don\'t think people have tried, like litecoin difficulty vs bitcoin price, expected payouts of scrypt coins vs bitcoin price, or number of altcoins listed on Cryptsy vs. bitcoin price.  I\'ll choose some ideas and create graphs of the most useful data that are live-updated on the charts pages.\n\n4.  As I predicted on Friday, nothing changed until Sunday night.  As such, I didn\'t make a post yesterday because there was nothing to talk about.  This place is a ghost town on weekends, which is strange because it\'s when you would think people have more time to post.\n\n5.  I think people should be cautious about these stories about bitcoin "entrepreneurs" entering the industry.  There are always people who want to call themselves entrepreneurs and never actually finish a product.  What convinced me that this idea of a flood of entrepreneurs is misleading is when I found out that Andreas Antonopolous, perhaps the most recognized face in bitcoins, was unable to make any money on bitcoins for two years and only recently has been paid full-time.  If he couldn\'t find contracts, then few people are going to work full-time on bitcoins and leave a well-paying job in some other field.': 17, 'Affect.': 2, 'This thread made me spit up my coffee.

In that sense, your spending habits aren\'t "fine." You don\'t get extra points for paying in full, even though it\'s financially smart to do so. The score relies on information in your credit report, which doesn\'t indicate that you\'ve paid off the balance. What it does show are your monthly balances as reported by creditors.\n\n> Despite your habit of paying in full, the monthly reported balance on your credit report may not be zero. The amount on your report will reflect the account balance at the time the lender supplied it to the credit bureaus. If your statement balance gets reported, then your credit report will show that you\'ve used 90 percent of your available credit.

Overfitting generally occurs when a model is excessively complex, such as having too many [parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parameter) relative to the number of observations. A model which has been overfit will generally have poor [predictive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_inference) performance, as it can exaggerate minor fluctuations in the data.\n\n>The possibility of overfitting exists because the criterion used for training the model is not the same as the criterion used to judge the efficacy of a model. In particular, a model is typically trained by maximizing its performance on some set of training data. However, its efficacy is determined not by its performance on the training data but by its ability to perform well on unseen data. Overfitting occurs when a model begins to memorize training data rather than learning to generalize from trend. As an extreme example, if the number of parameters is the same as or greater than the number of observations, a simple model or learning process can perfectly predict the training data simply by memorizing the training data in its entirety, but such a model will typically fail drastically when making predictions about new or unseen data, since the simple model has not learned to generalize at all.\n\n>The potential for overfitting depends not only on the number of parameters and data but also the conformability of the model structure with the data shape, and the magnitude of model error compared to the expected level of noise or error in the data.\n\n>====\n\n>[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/1QfzEtr.png) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Overfit.png) - *Noisy \\(roughly linear\\) data is fitted to both linear and polynomial functions.

The fact of the matter is that trend analysis is akin to divination sticks in many ways, and people heavily steeped in its tradition don\'t see this.  Charts and trends are things we notice in retrospect.  Some amount of general anticipation is warranted, but the belief that trends indicate future activities is backwards for more than one reason.\n\nNumber one: we generate economic models based on the activities of PEOPLE.  Understanding these peoples\' behavior allows us to attempt predictions of market behavior.  Graphs and trendlines and market data are a further abstraction of what people are doing, and applying "technical analysis" is another layer of abstraction that causes pseudorandom results.  Graphs SHOW US WHAT HAPPENED, they aren\'t meant to SHOW US WHAT WILL HAPPEN.  In order to see what will "happen," you look to the things determining the graphs-- the people.  TA does NONE of that.

Profits are taken from traders and distributed to other traders in some sort of absurd game called Capitalism; there is no revenue generated in the macroscopic scale.

I stated at least three times last week that this was purposeful manipulation by the Chinese government in an attempt to kill bitcoins.  Many people ignored that post and stated that "China didn\'t ban bitcoins" or that April 15 passed without any issues.  Today\'s news should serve as a reminder that the Chinese will be doing this for months to come.  It will happen again tonight, or Sunday night, or Monday night, or some other night next week.\n\n2.  Chinese news never occurs on weekends, and therefore, the price has moved little on weekends lately.\n\n3.  One can get bogged down in TA and in news, but there is only one (1) single concrete rule with bitcoins: the bubble cycle.  No matter what happens, the bubble cycle supersedes all other indicators and trends.  There have always been people who say "this is the last bubble" both at the top and bottom of bubbles, and they are always proven wrong.  The only surefire way to lose money has been to bet against the bubble cycle (ask /u/moral_agent), and his charts seem to indicate that this is the upward phase of the cycle.  \n\n4.  The next few months will be a war between the Chinese and Wall Street.  Wall St will win eventually, marginalizing the Chinese and putting an end to these swings simply because Wall St will have more money invested.\n\n5.  The flair counts on this subreddit have held steady for the past month.  This is completely unlike in December despite higher volatility, which makes me wonder if anyone plays the flair game anymore.  As such, they have lost all their predictive capacity and I won\'t be making any decisions influenced by the bulls to bears ratio from now forward.\n\n6.  Where has /u/emocmo gone?  He\'s a much better forecaster than any of us.  Instead of posting point and figure charts, he\'s been offering his advice in threads with titles like "should I tell him I want to suck his ****?"\n\n7.  Finally, a word about prices and off-market trades.  Some people seem to misunderstand how prices work.  The closer of a trade sets the price.  In January, I put a broken grill in front of my house with a paper that read "$50."  Someone knocked on the door and said he would pay $35.  I declined and the grill sat out in the snow until someone else came along and paid $35 for it.  Likewise, I could create a bid for 50 bitcoins at $10,000, but nobody would sell them and it would sit there for months.  This happened in October, when I watched many asks sitting around from April at Mt Gox suddenly being filled.  It\'s not until a seller contacts me and agrees to pay $10,000 that the bitcoins are sold, and the seller has set the price at $200.\n\n8.  This lesson about buying and selling is important because transactions aren\'t as simple as "every sale has a buyer and seller."  When bitcoins exchange hands off-market, the person who closes the deal is the one who determines if the price goes up or down.  The closer, who wants to transact more quickly than the other party,  can do two things: he can refuse the offer and go to the market (where the price moves directly), or he can accept the offer (and market participants later discover that coins which would otherwise have been transacted at that price are missing from the market).  Either way, the price still moves, but not as violently or immediately.\n\n9.  I edited this post to add one more thought.  I realize that people are trying to help, but these automated Google translations of Chinese news are as good as nonsense.  The markets move on insinuations and what is between the lines, and reading this stuff might actually cause people to make worse decisions.

In altcoin mining news, the charts are a beautiful thing:  http://shoemakervillage.org/temp/payouts-0418.jpg.  The expected payout for mining the most profitable coin for 1Mh/s/day has almost doubled since Monday.  It looks like, despite all the recent articles where people claim altcoins are going to disappear, they are still worth something yet.\n\n2.  I\'m shocked that no bad Chinese news happened last night.  That probably means that there won\'t be any more news until Sunday night, which means no abrupt crashes during the weekend.\n\n3.  Has anyone noticed the recent spate of articles and videos with big investors touting bitcoins as the next big thing?  /r/bitcoin is flooded with that one video on CNBC where bitcoin is recommended as the top investment of the next 25 years.\n\n4.  More interesting than these videos of bitcoin supporters are some of the opposition.  One key article titled "why I\'m not investing in bitcoin" seemed like negative news at first, but the author went on to say that he isn\'t doing so simply because the regulatory oversight isn\'t there yet.  He said there is plenty of money to be made once the risks of regulation are resolved.  Even the people who are less bullish on bitcoin aren\'t downing it anymore; they\'re just not going to invest until there is more money in the system.\n\n5.  One of the things that really peeved me was that Cryptsy started showing negative balances earlier in the week.  Apparently, this caused the Blackcoin pool to stop payouts, because they use Cryptsy to buy Blackcoins.  The Blackcoin pool was able to continue mining, but a more complex pool like mine, which is set to use Cryptsy when it opens on May 23, could not afford to continue operating during such a period.  And what are the alternatives?  Vircurex, which is insolvent and admits to it?  That lead me to realize that...\n\n6.  ...after all these years, it strikes me that the major issue with cryptocurrencies is the same as it was last year, and the year before that, and the year before that.  The NASDAQ doesn\'t go down for a day and show negative balances.  It is no wonder that people don\'t take bitcoins seriously when we still have exchanges that are fractional reserves, or which have serious bugs, which lose bitcoins to theft, or which charge fees as high as 1%.  I absolutely agree with the person who posted yesterday that the number one obstacle to mass adoption is that it is too expensive and unreliable to buy and sell cryptocurrencies.  A competitor needs to get into the market and undercut Coinbase before people will be willing to buy bitcoins in order to make everyday purchases.\n\n7.  /u/lowstrife posted a survey about what the next high will be.  To me, the majority of the estimates seem low.  Remember that last year, even the most optimistic supporters saw $800 as the bubble\'s high.  Bubbles always go higher than people expect, which is why my vote was for the average of the green and blue lines on /u/moral_agent\'s bubble chart.\n\n8.  I don\'t agree that Easter is going to have any impact whatsoever on the price of bitcoins, as some are saying.  There are fewer religious people every year, there are fewer people who attend church who are religious, many people celebrate on Sunday only, the excessive snow has cancelled most school vacations, Easter is not a public holiday, and not all Christians celebrate Easter on the same day.\n\n9.  Like yesterday, I edited this post to add one more thought.  I think it\'s a significant hit on blockchain\'s reputation that they decided to use the new B symbol on bitcoin.com, which they purchased recently.  Apparently, Blockchain and a few other smaller companies have an agenda of forcing this symbol to replace the well recognized one, and their way of implementing the agenda is to simply use it everywhere as if it were the standard practice that everyone agreed to.  I think most would agree that it is not acceptable for companies to unilaterally decide to change things that are overwhelmingly opposed by the vast majority of the community.  Given the success of drawing attention to other bad behavior in the past (like the resignation of a moderator in /r/technology over censorship), people who agree with me need to make sure that people are aware of what happened and generate some negative publicity against Blockchain for what they are doing.\n\n10.  I edited this post again because /u/folhowk pointed out that I was mistaken as to the symbol used.  However, I still believe that a debate is warranted before arbitrarily changing symbols without consulting anyone.

I think first of all we can\'t put the cart in front of the horse.  The way things are currently, institutions would not enter bitcoin at all. They certainly won\'t be sending millions of dollars to exchanges in Slovenia, let alone exchanges that are completely anonymous, unregulated and unaccountable. \n\nInstitutional investors cannot and will not get into bitcoins in a major way until the regulatory climate is solidified.  The US senate hearings, New York regulatory proposals, and IRS ruling was a huge step in the right direction in that regard for the US anyways.  \n\nOnce there is a framework in place, and I believe it will be a simple matter of confirming the legal status of bitcoin, classifying it as they do other securities, and applying the same rules that apply to other securities traders to bitcoin "exchanges", we will begin to see new models for buying, selling and trading bitcoins. \n\nSo let\'s consider a whole new model, the one I believe Second Market is working towards:  Imagine the blockchain being like the stock market.  Second Market would be like the NYSE, where brokers (Coinbase, Kraken, VOS, etc.) will buy and sell bitcoins on behalf of their local customers, and deal with the local regulation and make a fee per trade like existing stock (or Forex) brokers.  Institutional investors are free to get involved in the same way they can now with equities.  \n\n>The market cap has to be a lot more before institutional money can directly be invested.\n\nI disagree with this only because there is a lot equity funds that invest in smaller cap stocks (companies under $1-2 billion).\n\nBut I also disagree with the market cap logic in its entirety.  Bitcoin, we all know, has the power to revolutionize the world of finance (as does other technologies, but bitcoin seems to be winning the race so far), and other technologies.  There are investors out there willing to throw tens of millions (a drop in the bucket compared to the billions in their investment arsenal) for the potential to get in on the next big thing early.  And bitcoin won\'t be the next Microsoft, Apple or Google, it could be the next Internet or Cellphone.  And let\'s not forget that there has been already at least $150 million invested into bitcoin related companies to date (that we are aware of, I\'d guess it is well beyond that). \n\nSo my final thought is this; Institutional Investors *cannot* get involved with bitcoin yet, but we are already well on our way to changing that.  Once the regulatory issues are out of the way, they then *can* get involved, but time will tell if they want to or not.  Honestly the MtGox\'s and BTCe\'s of the world aren\'t helping, and I agree with your sentiment that it is far from safe to say with absolute certainty "wall street is coming".  But with great people behind a great technology, I think it can become a reality very quickly.  \n\nFollow Barry Silbert and Second Market, Marc Andreessen, Winkelvoss, Pantera Capital, Chamath Palihapitiya very closely, these are the guys who can (and I believe will) make it happen.

Since Mycelium servers are connected to hundreds, if not thousands, of nodes, they are able to track transaction propagation through the network in real time. Transaction Confidence, expressed in percent, shows a close estimate of how much of the overall Bitcoin network has heard about the transaction. The idea is that, if most of the network has already heard about the transaction, double-spending it becomes much more difficult, and the chances of it being included in the next block approach 100%. So, if the confidence is high enough (it reaches high 90\xe2\x80\x99s within a few seconds), you can be fairly sure that this transaction will be included in the block, and do in person trades with zero block confirmations.

The Network Effect: There will be many more participants in the bitcoin world, many of whom have cash to burn.

And it\'s what Bitcoin doesn\'t have.\nIf you\'re an institution and you invest in a fund, you don\'t wire funds to the fund manager. Your funds are wired to a *custody bank*, that holds your assets (the cash and the stocks the fund manager is buying). The fund manager never handles the cash himself, and never takes possession of the stocks himself.\nNow apply that to Bitcoin world. A Bitcoin fund manager actually controls the keys himself, he\'s essentially holding the assets himself. Very very few institutions would (or even could) go for an arrangement like this. Sure Dan Morehead (Pantera) might convince his old friends and clients to do it, but the real money wouldn\'t (couldn\'t) touch it. Look at Second Market: they list their "custodian" as "Second Market Holdings".\n\nSomebody will solve this but until they do the flow will be a tiny trickle. Listing the Second Market Fund OTC will be a help, and normal custody arrangements will apply. But if I was the SEC, I\'d be looking very carefully at the ownership of assets issue. It\'s probably also why the Winkelvii have not succeeded in getting their fund past the SEC.

It was hard enough to convince many institutions to think of gold and silver as legitimate investment vehicles, despite the long history of those metal being used as such.

I think the basic intuition is this: consider a big movement upwards because of some news, say, Obama buys bitcoin. At first, demand is very high, everyone starts buying. They don\'t know where the new price will be, but they know it should be higher. As it keeps keeps rising, less and less people buy it until it reaches the peak and the subsequent sell off. \n\nNow people know that it went too high, because demand ran out of steam. So the price starts dropping, but this too starts to run out of steam. The crowd as a whole thinks it should be somewhere between those two points. If it finds support above the midpoint (e.g. 38.2 fib), then the gears in the crowd machine think all the other gears concur that the peak is closer to the "true price" than the initial point. So people start buying again, which sets off a herd reaction.\n\nThats basically what the fibonacci is measuring - psychology. So why does fib work slightly better than midpoints? Well, the general explanation is that this measure is popular, so lots of people trade on it, and know that others trade on it too. So its a self-fulfilling prophecy in a way. But that doesn\'t explain why fibonacci became popular for being accurate in the first place. Maybe human emotions experience the market at marginally changing rates, and it seems the fibonacci shares a functional form with some components of whatever the function for aggregate market psychology is. \n\nWho knows.

They did truly receive notice from higher up at the bank, requesting a halt to our ICBC Zhongguancun Account, effective April 18\n2. The notice was an oral notice. The branch has not received anything in writing\n3. When asked why other banks had not sent out the same notice, the response was that different banks may be interpreting policies in different ways, and may have different levels of sensitivity\n4. When asked if there was any room for maneuvering, the answer was that there was none. The order had come from above, and there was nothing to discuss\n5. When asked how to handle user funds in the future, the answer was that we could shift our funds to a different commercial bank, but not ICBC.\n\nWe asked the Customer Manager to provide his views on the Bitcoin policy and related matters, but since they did not represent ICBC's views, and had little direct bearing on Huobi's operations, they will not be explained point-by-point in this notice.\n\nToday at 12:00, we rushed back to the office to release this notice. Before release of this notice, we did not notify any users or organizations in advance. Please keep an eye on this.\n\nHuobi will officially suspend deposits through its ICBC Zhongguancun Branch account next Monday (April 14)(this will not affect users withdrawing cash from ICBC. We will use accounts at other banks to transfer the funds to your account). At present, this does not affect other banks. Huobi will release any new information immediately.": 58, 'why the deadline is 18th of April?': 4, "Things does not happen really like that in China.

When you are big, you better play by the rules and if they are not very well explained, you tend to be play it safe rather than borderline.\n\nOne good example is Taobao (chinese ebay) banning every item related  to bitcoin/crypto couple months ago. They even banned some specific hardware used for mining! And the only "rule" at that time was that 3rd party payment provider were not allowed to work with Bitcoin businesses. Taobao prefered to play it safe and updated their policies.\n\n\nI don\'t understand why everyone wants to see FUD here when we have almost 1 exchange stating their bank account is about to get closed per day!

But,\n\n>Volume: As the Triple Bottom Reversal develops, overall volume levels usually decline^(1). Volume sometimes increases near the lows^(2). After the third low, an expansion of volume on the advance and at the resistance breakout greatly reinforces the soundness of the pattern^(3).\n\n1. The first low had a volume of 135k, the second 115k, and third 35k.  These are not overall numbers, but only the lows' volumes.  Not as clear cut--volume is still very volatile--but it does seem to be declining from Dec 17 to today.\n\n2. There have been *huge* volume spikes near the lows.\n\n3. Remains to be seen.  Resistance price looks to be somewhere in the $850-900s, with the highest spike at $994.94.  This pattern is not complete unless the price rises above the breakout.\n\nThis trend has been going on for about 4 months (Dec 17 - April 10), and the model suggests 3-6 month trends to fit the pattern.  If we see a large increase in volume in the trend's immediate term (2-3 weeks), this pattern strongly suggests a return to $850-900s prices.\n\nAnother interesting tidbit about this pattern is the future price target:\n\n>Price Target: The distance from the resistance breakout to lows can be measured and added to the resistance break for a price target. The longer the pattern develops, the more significant is the ultimate breakout. Triple Bottom Reversals that are 6 or more months in duration represent major bottoms and a price target is less likely to be effective.\n\nAt 4 months, we are trending to a more significant breakout price, which validates the high $850-1000 range.

Sunk costs are sometimes contrasted with *[prospective costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prospective_costs)*, which are future costs that may be incurred or changed if an action is taken.

Sherman notes, however, that many economists consider it a mistake to classify sunk costs as "fixed" or "variable." For example, if a firm sinks $1 million on an enterprise software installation, that cost is "sunk" because it was a one-time expense and cannot be recovered once spent. A "fixed" cost would be monthly payments made as part of a service contract or licensing deal with the company that set up the software. The upfront irretrievable payment for the installation should *not* be deemed a "fixed" cost, with its cost spread out over time. Sunk costs should be kept separate. The "variable costs" for this project might include data centre power usage, etc.\n\n>====\n\n>[**Image**](https://i.imgur.com/a0X8swD.jpg) [^(i)](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Daniel_KAHNEMAN.jpg)\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Escalation ^of ^commitment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment) ^| [^Relevant ^cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relevant_cost) ^| [^Psychology ^of ^previous ^investment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology_of_previous_investment) ^| [^Contestable ^market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contestable_market) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cgp3gq7) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cgp3gq7)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)': 2, 'around 350 now on btce.

Gox, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe investor group, which includes Brock Pierce, a former child actor-turned technology entrepreneur, is offering a token payment of one bitcoin, or about $400, to buy the exchange outright, according to these people. The acquisition must be approved by a Japanese bankruptcy court.\n\nMt. Gox collapsed in February after disclosing that 750,000 bitcoins belonging to customers had vanished, along with an additional 100,000 bitcoins owned by the virtual-currency exchange. Since then, about 200,000 bitcoins have been recovered and are part of the exchange\'s assets.\n\nThe investor group hopes to revive the exchange and set aside 50% of its transaction fees to pay back burned customers and other creditors over time, according to documents filed to the Japanese bankruptcy court and reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe near-zero valuation of the proposed deal could to be a hurdle in bankruptcy court.\n\nAccording to people familiar with the plan, the group is justifying the low price because of the "information vacuum" over Mt. Gox\'s 550,000 missing bitcoins, currently worth about $220 million. It isn\'t possible to place a value on the lost coins, they said.\n\nCreditors, who have been stuck in limbo since their accounts were frozen, would have the option of receiving a prorated payment from the 200,000 recovered bitcoins, an estimated 20% recovery value on their claims, or receiving the equivalent amount in equity in the new exchange.\n\nLaunched in 2009, bitcoin is a computer-driven currency that isn\'t backed by a central bank. Users "mine," or create, bitcoins by tapping high-powered computers to answer complex mathematical problems. The coins are stored in digital wallets that have proven to be susceptible to hacking.\n\nBitcoin\'s price soared to more than $1,100 in November before plunging as Chinese government officials clamped down on bitcoin trading and Mt. Gox lurched toward bankruptcy. The Tokyo exchange halted customer withdrawals in dollars last year, and in February stopped allowing customers to withdraw money in any currency.\n\nThe potential revival of Mt. Gox, which had struggled with technical problems for months before its collapse, comes at a critical time for the virtual currency. A wave of big investors are pouring money into startup bitcoin businesses, but price volatility and regulatory scrutiny are creating uncertainty about the currency\'s long-term prospects.\n\nMr. Pierce, 33 years old, appeared in "The Mighty Ducks" movie series in the 1990s, and has since become an investor focused on technology companies.\n\nOther investors in the group include venture capitalists William Quigley, the managing director of Santa Monica, Calif.-based Clearstone Venture Partners and a former financial director Disney Inc.\'s licensing businesses; and Matthew Roszak, a partner at Chicago-based SilkRoad Equity, a venture-capital firm.

In that guidance, FinCEN said federally regulated entities would be exempt from those requirements.\n\nIt isn\'t clear how the SEC, which doesn\'t regulate bitcoin, might respond to Atlas\'s use of the National Stock Exchange\'s SRO status to earn this exemption. The SEC declined to comment for this article.\n\nIn a statement, Atlas said its rule book would be based on SEC-approved rules used by U.S. stock and option exchanges. These establish requirements for record books, the segregation of customer accounts, security of assets and other standards.\n\nFor the all-electronic National Stock Exchange, or NSX, the move could deliver a new source of revenue and relevancy in an industry increasingly dominated by far bigger exchanges such as IntercontinentalExchange ICE +1.62%  Group and its NYSE-Euronext unit and Nasdaq OMX NDAQ +3.21%  Group.\n\nNSX traces its roots to the Cincinnati Stock Exchange, founded in the 1880s.

He said the decision to work with Atlas was made entirely by NSX Chairman and CEO David Harris. "I was instrumental in explaining what the industry around virtual currencies was all about, but that\'s about the extent of my involvement," Mr. Karsh said.\n\nAtlas functions like an automated bitcoin trading system, providing rapid-fire, anonymous matching services for clients such as high-frequency trading firms, though it isn\'t formally regulated as an ATS by the SEC.

In each stage, the person confronts, and hopefully masters, new challenges. Each stage builds upon the successful completion of earlier stages. The challenges of stages not successfully completed may be expected to reappear as problems in the future.\n\n>However, mastery of a stage is not required to advance to the next stage. Erikson's stage theory characterizes an individual advancing through the eight life stages as a function of negotiating his or her biological forces and sociocultural forces. Each stage is characterized by a psychosocial crisis of these two conflicting forces (as shown in the table below). If an individual does indeed successfully reconcile these forces (favoring the first mentioned attribute in the crisis), he or she emerges from the stage with the corresponding virtue. For example, if an infant enters into the toddler stage (autonomy vs. shame & doubt) with more trust than mistrust, he or she carries the virtue of hope into the remaining life stages. \n\n\n>\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Erikson's ^stages ^of ^psychosocial ^development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erikson%27s_stages_of_psychosocial_development) ^| [^Developmental ^psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_psychology) ^| [^Ego ^integrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_integrity) ^| [^Developmental ^stage ^theories](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_stage_theories) ^| [^Child ^development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_development) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cgzvsmb) ^or[](#or) [^delete](http://www.np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cgzvsmb)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)": 4, 'But they have the trollbox.

Folks like Ray Kurzweil and other optimistic futurists don\'t seem to have a very realistic grasp on the complexity of biology or intelligence. Their hopes are generally founded on nothing more than absurd extensions of Moore\'s law.\n\nThe reality is that AI research moves as a snail\'s pace. Even the best computers we can imagine still require a human to program them, and a human to give them data. How can we cure aging when we don\'t even know *what* data to give the computer? Or maybe Ray thinks we\'re going to invent true, generalized AI that will do all of this work for us. Yeah - ask an AI researcher about when they will get around to inventing strong AI and they won\'t even be able to say it\'ll happen in 1000 years, or ever, let alone by 2065. Nobody knows how intelligence works and AI research progresses very slowly - limited mostly to inflexible, algorithmic applications like machine vision, walking robots, and self-driving cars. They seem impressive but a human had to program every single aspect - there\'s no true intelligence on the part of the machine.\n\nOn the biology front, we have identified a few things implicated in aging, but turning those things off (eg, elongating telomeres to counteract DNA degradation) tends to have serious side effects, like rampant cancer.\n\nCuring aging will not be some simple thing, and I don\'t foresee it happening for a few hundred years yet. 40 years? Not even close. It\'s not going to be just a matter of pumping a person full of telomerase and giving them a bit of gene therapy. There are lots of mysteries still to solve. And once we do solve them, we basically have to be able to build a human being from scratch in a lab before we can actually do much beyond simple medical procedures. Because that\'s the same level of technology it will take to repair ever cell in an existing human being.\n\nThis doesn\'t necessarily mean we\'re all going to die and there\'s nothing that can be done, since we are likely to make medical breakthroughs that *extend* our lifespans long enough to see further extensions and so on (sometimes called "functional immortality").

You are clearly more an optimist than I. I don\'t think this will happen in my lifetime.\n\n> But I also don\'t think that strong AI is necessary to solve these problems. With enough computational power, you can simulate the effects of quadrillions of drugs and find one that extends lifespan simply by chance.\n\nIn order to turn a problem into a simulation or a series of equations to be solved, you must fully understand the intricacies of the system being simulated or modeled. Otherwise, the answers will apply only to an over-simplified model and may or may not actually be real answers.\n\nTo do what you suggest would require simulating an entire organism. Simulating even just one cell is a nigh impossible goal at the moment. Now start trying to simulate more than one, with them all interacting? The system gets more complicated, exponentially, with each added cell, due to the multiple interactions between them. The thing about problems that get exponentially more complicated as you add nodes, is that they counteract the exponential nature of Moore\'s law.\n\nIn the real world, it\'s easier to just use animal models (rats) instead. We will probably have strong AI long before we get to that point of being able to intricately simulate an animal in a computer to the point at which we can use this for drug testing.\n\nThe closest we will get to that within our lifetimes is a technology being produced by a company that actually makes "chips" which are fancy petri dishes contain cell cultures on various media, that simulate different types of organs, and you can also simulate blood flow, air flow, etc (like if you want to simulate a lung). And even then, they are so artificial... they are not going to react in the same way as a real organism.\n\n>': 3, "Hope there's a second foundation keeping an eye on things :)": 1, 'In my experience they are one of the most reliable, along with the best interface of any exchange out there.

It almost reminds me of the Foundation series by Asimov. At each crossing point in the Foundation's development, Hari Seldon came and answered the question they had (from the past. Weird series) because he'd predicted mathematically all of the major movements of their society.\n\nI don't know if the question you've picked that needs to be answered is the correct one, but I think that the questions you picked discussing previous booms are pretty accurate.": 2, "As for number 9. Please take a look at Monetas and Open Transactions. True trustless off chain transactions are very close and won't require Bitpay, Coinbase, or any banks to hold your coins.": 2, 'There have been some recent developments that might help on the machine learning side,  they think they can make memristors behave like synapses.\n\n[Integration of nanoscale memristor synapses in neuromorphic computing architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.7007)\n\nMemristors are just now going into real production.': 3, 'A few thoughts:\n\n1.  There is a model of psychological development of the lifecycle:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_stages_of_psychosocial_development.  The theory goes that as people become older, they "graduate" from one big question to another big question in their lives.  At each phase, they can fail and be held back in their development, or they can move on to the next life phase.\n\n2.  You may know some of the people who failed at particular life phases.  For example, there are plenty of 25-year-olds who live with their parents and have yet to start a career.  These people are stuck in the adolescent "Fidelity" phase, having not resolved the previous life stage\'s conflict of choosing what their beliefs and values are.\n\n3.  Bitcoins also go through cycles of questions.  Each downturn between bubbles seems to bring another major question that gets resolved at the end of the cycle.  Of course, in any of the cycles, the negative answer can occur, and development of bitcoins would be stunted or ended.\n\n4.  Two cycles ago, the question was whether there was simply any demand at all for the benefits bitcoins provided.  As the number of businesses accepting bitcoins grew, the price skyrocketed into a bubble, answering the question.  During the last cycle, the constant question was whether bitcoins would be accepted by governments or only be a haven for drug dealers.  When that question was answered with the shutdown of the Silk Road and the Senate hearings, the price of bitcoins skyrocketed.\n\n5.  I propose that, in order to predict market trends, one needs to understand the core theme of the current cycle.  As many have pointed out, new merchants accepting bitcoins no longer move the market - that question was answered several cycles ago.  During the last cycle, every action by FinCEN caused 10% drops, as much as $8-$10 per day.  When places the Sheep Marketplace imploded, prices plummeted.  Now, you don\'t hear anything about those black markets, nor does the price move on FinCEN, because those questions are settled.\n\n6.  I propose that the question for this cycle is whether bitcoins are a tool for serious  investors and businessmen, or whether bitcoins will be dominated by shady or incompetent characters like Danny Brewster, Mark Karpeles, Charlie Shrem, the people who run BTC-e and GHash.io, and Chinese market manipulators.\n\n7.  If that is the question for this cycle, then the only possible resolutions are going to be are:  a big company like Google "adopts" bitcoins as the primary method of payment for all its services, Wall Street opens funds and regulated exchanges that put these other guys out of business, or a government selects bitcoins as their currency.  Watch for one of those things to happen, and buy big when it does.  \n\n8.  Each time, the negative answer to the question becomes less and less severe.  Two cycles ago, the negative result would have been the complete collapse of the bitcoin network.  Last cycle, failure would have meant bitcoins being the domain of drug dealers and scammers.  Now, failure probably means that bitcoins become a specialty Internet payment system that is used by a small number of anonymity-focused merchants like pornographers.\n\n9.  In the next cycle, my thought is that the questions upon which bitcoins rise and fall will be technical in nature.  For example: if bitcoins can scale past the 1MB transaction limit into a global reserve currency, or whether the high transaction fees resulting from being unable to resolve the problem causes them to become a clearinghouse between centralized off-chain networks like Bitpay, Coinbase, and big banks.  While the previous cycles have all been political, the politics will eventually die down, and the technical is going to come to the foreground before the end of the year.': 87, 'That, all other other geoengineering-based solutions, seem like risky ideas to me.\n\nGlobal warming is not caused by too much sunlight, it\'s caused by the absorption and re-emission of long-wave radiation by greenhouse gases.

There are bad investments (roulette, [Mining Contract One on Cryptsy](http://theblogchain.com/trading/cryptsy-mining-contract-one/)) and good investments (poker against weak opponents with no rake, [.3% CFDs on Bitfinex](http://theblogchain.com/bitcoin-exchange-reviews/bitfinex-review/)) in both traditional finance and in gambling.\n\n> See that word believe, that\'s the problem, you can\'t know your trade is +ev, so you have to manage the risk that you\'re wrong. You aren\'t. Your style of trading will inevitably lead to a huge loss on a single trade because you didn\'t manage risk on that trade and you were wrong about the +ev. How many 20% losses can your account suffer because you made a streak of bad trades? If you think you\'re immune from a streak of bad trades, then you\'re lying to yourself.\n\nI\'ll need to pick this apart a bit. \n\n* Can\'t know I\'m +ev\n\nIt might sound cavalier or dismissive, but... so? Of course I don\'t know the future. All investments are bets on the belief that the investment is +ev. They are definitionally incapable of being anything else. If your argument here held, [the inevitable conclusion of it is that no one ought to take any action, ever.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume#Induction)\n\nI (like everyone else who diversifies their portfolio) manage the risk of being incorrect by only assigning a portion of my portfolio to that bet.\n\nHowever, I\'m not required to manage that risk--although you seem to think I am. If I assign the following criteria to my actions:\n\n1. Risk is irrelevant\n2. EV maximization is the only goal\n\nThen I should take the following strategy:\n\n1. Always have an open bet so long as for the bet p > (.5 + 2xfee)\n2. All bets must involve as much of the portfolio as possible without causing p <= (.5 + 2xfee)\n\nDo you disagree with that?\n\n* Inevitable huge loss on a single trade\n\nIt\'s already happened. I publish a log of my trades on TheBlogChain. I\'m far from immune to a streak of bad trades--I\'ve had a ~16% loss on a single trade, and I had a streak that went for (IIRC) 3 trades that went -4%, -2%, -5%. I\'ve also had winning streaks, as is the nature of the world--I had 20 trades that went 19 wins and 1 loss, and if you multiply them together in order came out to +89%. What\'s wrong with losing, apart from the psychological predisposition we natively possess that forces us to remember failure with a searing pain? Obviously I\'m aware of how the math works out (e.g. lose 20% then win 20% = down 4%; or win 20% then lose 20% = down 4%), but beyond that what\'s the difference?\n\n> If you can\'t tell me going into the trade how much you\'ll lose if you\'re wrong, then you\'re not managing risk. You don\'t even know your risk. If you make 5 bad trades in a row going all in on every one, you could easily blow the account. Just because you\'re OK blowing the account doesn\'t mean you\'re managing risk on that account.\n\nI go into every trade knowing how much I\'ll lose if I\'m wrong. It\'s called a stop loss. You set them wherever you decide you\'re \'wrong\' at.\n\nLosing 5 trades in a row doesn\'t blow the account. The account value as a % of the portfolio stays constant.\n\nWhy do I need to balance the risk on the account, and not just on my portfolio?\n\ne.g. you maintain two investments: one in a high-risk hedge fund, one in a low-risk mutual fund. They each make up 50% of your portfolio. The hedge fund risk is X, the mutual fund risk is Y. You move your entire portfolio to an index fund, whose risk is .5X + .5Y. Has your risk changed?\n\n> False. Investing differs from gambling in that gambling is a subset of investing where the house has the advantage and wins long term. Trading can be gambling, your style certainly is, but not all trading is gambling. Even professional gamblers size their positions according to risk, see kelly betting\n\nAgain, from Wikipedia, gambling is "...the wagering of money or something of material value (referred to as "the stakes") on an event with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning additional money and/or material goods." It has nothing to do with the house having an advantage. I\'ll engage your definition to explain why this is the case.\n\nIf gambling is defined as "a subset of investing where the house has the advantage and wins long term" then that leads to the following conclusions:\n\n1. Buying a bitcoin on an exchange that takes a commission is gambling under all conditions. They take a rake, remember?\n2. Buying stock through a brokerage that charges a commission is gambling under all conditions. The \'house\' always wins long term.\n3. Poker at a casino against other participants with a 0% rake is not gambling. The house is neutral.\n4. My standing offer to flip a coin for $1 with a friend is not gambling. The house is, again, neutral.\n\nObviously something must be wrong here. Most individuals would intuitively consider the former two investing and the latter two gambling. For what it\'s worth, in my view, they are all the same. Call them bets or investments, I don\'t care. There\'s no difference--they\'re all uncertain propositions with varying expected values. That\'s of course not to mean they\'re all equally good bets/investments.\n\n> And by the way, the Kelly Criterion is mathematical proof that your strategy is not optimal, because the Kelly Criterion is the optimal approach. Your style suffers from huge drawdowns during losing streaks that make it sub-optimal in actually growing the equity curve.\n\nYou know, my favorite part about this is that my strategy *is* actually Kelly Betting. The \'bankroll\' is my entire portfolio. The bet is X; the share of my portfolio dedicated to trading. X remains approximately constant as a % of my total portfolio. X is the Kelly Bet size, ideally speaking.\n\nSide note: there is also a fairly obvious flaw in directly applying the Kelly Betting principle to trading; the basis for the claim is that the bets considered are binary (double or nothing). The reason that Kelly Betting is optimal is that someone with a 1% edge on the house who bets it all on a double-or-nothing is only 50.5/49.5, whereas someone who does it infinity times is 100/0. The Kelly Bet is successful by combating the intense variance of double-or-nothing to exploit a minor advantage. \n\nA percentage bet, like trading, is actually already by its nature a perfect variation of the strategy of the Kelly Bet. You could think of it like this:\n\nBuy at 100. Lose 1 value. Lose 1 value. Gain 1 value. Lose 1 value. Gain 1 value. etc. Each time, you have the option to \'end\' the bet, or to continue playing. In fact, trading is actually an near-infinitely divisible Kelly Bet in this sense--you can make a new decision every time you\'re given new information. This ability to "redecide" your bet reduces your variance in the same way the Kelly Bet reduces variance by spreading the variance of double-or-nothing over infinite bets. Essentially, you get to \'make\' the bet again every time information changes. Obviously, I don\'t (nor does anyone except bots) actually do this--the existence of the option to do so, is, however, interesting. The Kelly Bet works by making a binary bet into a multivariable bet: instead of w or l we get wlwlwlwlwlllwlwlwwwwwwlwllw etc. Trading is a multivariable bet to begin with--the market goes +-+--+++---++--+++-+ etc.\n\nThanks for your post.

You can turn this on by selecting the 3d period and under settings, turning the indicator type to MACD.\n\nMACD is based on the difference between two exponential moving averages - one fast and one slow. To figure out how to calculate it yourself, [see here]( http://stockcharts.com/help/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_conve). It's a lagging indicator, telling you about the recent past. If it's positive, it suggests and uptrend. If it's negative, it suggests a downtrend.\n\nW1 STO is a stochastic RSI calculated with a 1 week period. You can see this on bitcoinwisdom by setting the period to 1 week and setting the indicator to StochRSI. RSI is like StochRSI (it's actually the base from which StochRSI is calculated) but less sensitive (also less prone to false positives).\n\nBoth StochRSI and RSI look at the loss/gain for the current candle and compares that to previous losses and gains to try to estimate if the current market is overbought or oversold. When RSI/StochRSI is high (over 80%), that is an indication to some that the market is overbought. This suggests the price *may* be due for a downward correction. And if RSI/StochRSI is low (less than 20%) that's an indication of the opposite - it may be oversold and you might expect an upwards correction.\n\nTo figure out how to calculate RSI and StochRSI, [see here](https://www.tradingview.com/stock-charts-support/index.php/Stochastic_RSI_(STOCH_RSI\\)). Note that bitcoinwisdom calculates RSI and StochRSI based on an exponential moving average (EMA), and not the raw price. That's why it's so smooth.\n\nYou'll note my use of weasel words.

There's an article circulating where the author postulates that the price of bitcoins will fall as low as $120 before the next bubble begins.  While I don't agree with the technical analysis he uses to reach that figure, I know that if bitcoins are ever worth $120 again, I will go back on my word that I had maxed out my stake and will probably be purchasing 250 of them.\n\n2.  In the same chart, the author predicts that a bubble will top out at $4400 two months later.  30x returns are the sort of figures where millionaires are made.  Who needs to wait for bitcoins to reach $100,000 when you can be rich now (if the price falls that low first)?\n\n3.  Some people are arguing that nobody believed there was going to be another bubble the last time a bubble happened.  First, I want to point out that, a month ago, people were saying that bitcoins were done and there won't even be another bubble.  Second, before the last bubble, there were some very prominent authors who correctly predicted a dramatic rise weeks in advance of the bubble.  The owner of the Genesis Block is one person who comes to mind.  I certainly wasn't surprised when I saw the price rising into a bubble.\n\n4.  Yesterday, I demonstrated that, by trading .04 bitcoins across a $24 spread, it is possible to earn as much as **18 cents** after taxes, exchange fees, and bank transfer fees.  You're not going to get rich by trading one bitcoin back and forth, because one needs to consider the idea of opportunity costs.  Even if you could make $50 per day this way after taxes, you could make $100/day by working at McDonald's, and a job at McDonald's has zero risk of losing any money.  Even if you win more than 50% of the time at trading, you could still be losing money compared to what you could be doing instead.\n\n5.  Speaking of taxes, a good rule of thumb is to divide what you earn from bitcoin trades in half.  In my case, I get about 56% if I were to make daytrades.  That comes from a Federal tax rate of 28%, state taxes of 5%, local taxes, exchange fees, and bank account fees.  However, those who earn less can see slightly greater profits from trading.\n\n6.  Many people here also aren't considering that a 50% win rate at trading isn't good enough.  If you earn money, you pay taxes, but if you lose money, you take fewer deductions than if you had earned money.  That's because state taxes don't allow you to deduct losses the same way that Federal taxes do.  You actually need to win more than about 55% of the time in order to break even.  That's a tall order, and it's why so many people are losing money at this.  In conclusion, people need to do their homework and review the actual and opportunity costs to decide if it is worthwhile to make frequent trades.  In most cases, it probably isn't.\n\n7.  On a side note, it is quite disappointing that GHash.io released a multipool.  While it disappoints me from a competitive standpoint, the major problem is that we have yet another anonymous bitcoin organization whose founders are too dishonest to reveal who they are expanding into greater territory.  They almost gained a majority of bitcoin hashing power in January, and now they could gain a majority of altcoin hashing power before I can get (edited: my pool although the joke below is good) released on May 23.  And yes, for those who thought they read wrong, I said dishonest.  There is no acceptable reason for Middlecoin, GHash.io, BTC-e, and similar people to hide their identities.  Their names and addresses should be on their websites for everyone to see.\n\n8.  To prove that I stand for transparency, you can read all of my personal information at http://remixsquared.com/artists/quintin3265.  And I don't (yet) hold anyone else's bitcoins.

Consumers would be forced to choose between taking the risk of getting sick, or not eating at restaurants.

Honest operators do pay taxes.  Perhaps I am the only person who disapproves of anonymous cowards leeching off of society while you and I pay our fair share.  It doesn't matter whether we believe taxes are too high or not; whatever the law, they should pay as much as we do.

As Tatterz said, the act of bank transfers being shut down is still not priced in. Even the Chinese have no idea about what\'s happening behind the scene. The recent comments of Chinese users (4/8) on Weibo about Huobi expanding outside of China shows that they are oblivious to the ban, just like us. Indeed, they have no reason to withdraw/sell their BTCs unless the exchanges publicly announce that they must halt bank transfers and move offshore. However, banks have no reason to do so prior to the deadline, because it is detrimental to money flow.\n\nNow, there are good reasons to believe the rumors are true. Huobi is expanding out of China, but they deny the move being affected by the 415 event. However, I believe they\'re "setting up" for the ban. They didn\'t deny the 415 event. Same thing for Bobby Lee, who believes the notice is "pre-dawn darkness" and is ready to move offshore (also didn\'t deny the ban of commercial banks). OKCoin announced that they\'re ready to move offshore after April 15. FXBTC/BTC38 confirmed that all commercial banks received memos about the ban. I fail to see why we\'d only ban FXBTC/BTC38 and leave the rest running...\n\nAs of today, only the 3rd party payment processors ban has been priced in. This was expected, price dropped to 500. However, if the rumors about the bank halting are true and the exchanges close CNY deposits and apply withdrawal guidelines on 415 (unlike 3rd party processors, they can wait until the deadline without any problem), then we\'ll witness a shitstorm on the market... Again,  I believe it\'s still not priced in.\n\nhttp://www.pcpop.com/doc/0/998/998876.shtml\n\nhttp://www.btc798.com/article-3526-1.html\n\nBobby Lee: \xe2\x80\x9cA general lack of domestic investment targets, coupled with the lack of understanding of bitcoin led to bitcoins becoming speculative grade. After the April 15 message, investors will re-evaluate bitcoin, an industry reshuffle may also occur.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\nTo Tatterz: Most Chinese investors bought Bitcoin for the sole reason of quick profit. I don\'t think they\'re in for long-term. Buy Bitcoin and you\'ll become rich soon. From 100 to 1000 in a month. The majority have no idea about how Bitcoin works; they didn\'t study the fundamentals or even check the price before buying. Exchanges have exploited this lucrative situation by offering extremely easy ways to fund your account (3rd party, vouchers, etc.) The Chinese government has good reasons to apply strict regulation (bank transfers halting, 3rd party deposits halting) to prevent people from investing on the top of the pyramid. I believe that if they see a crash, they\'ll panic sell. \n': 7, "Try the 1WK 50/200EMA on Bitstamp. Well far from touching.

The market moves up from here in a consistent fashion and the two never cross.\n\n2. They cross and the market reacts negatively. How negatively I wouldn't even want to guess.\n\n3. They cross and no one gives a shit. These indicators only matter if people react to them.\n\nAs for the suggestion to look at the 1W, that's really only useful for looking at the very large picture.

We dipped down into the low $440\xe2\x80\x99s overnight.  This has changed some indicators.\n\nThe positive breakout point dropped to $470.  We are in a formation 5 boxes wide.  Our Breakdown price remains around $415.\n\nThe trend reversal price has dropped to $520\xe2\x80\x94meaning at that point the overall pressure/feeling of the market would turn upward.\n\nZoom back and you can see one hell of a triangle forming.  There are two arrow points.  Once represents the short term terns (dark blue + and the lower course coming up from the bottom left.)  The other is the all time high resistance, and the pre bubble low support.\n\nNow, this part is MY analysis\xe2\x80\x94not something most Point and Figure purists would suggest.  But, based on my \xe2\x80\x9cfeeling\xe2\x80\x9d of the market I think this might be valid.  We are seventeen columns from the column where the resistance coming down from the all time high (little grey + marks) and the upward support from the support point from BEFORE to the September-November bubble meet.  That is indicated on my chart by the purple column furthest to the right.\n\nThe Dark blue box and red square indicate the \xe2\x80\x9cpoint\xe2\x80\x9d where those two lines intersect.  That is the point I would call the bottom\xe2\x80\x94or at least a very significant point.  By that I mean, if we blow through that point with any conviction, we will drop down much further.  The two support lines I am showing are the final two on my chart.  I would have to start building the chart backwards to bring up another line.\n\nMy logic is that when the downward resistance meets the pre bubble support, the bubble will have been priced out of the market.  After that we move on news and \xe2\x80\x9cvalue\xe2\x80\x9d not as much by speculation.  Until we see another bubble.\n\nSo, here is my thinking.  We will probably continue bleeding downward until we break $400.  The longer we linger at this formation ($440-465) the more dramatic the move.  As we get closer to the purple column, I will be more optimistic that we take off from there\xe2\x80\x94as we will bump into resistance.  I would also not be surprised to see us move up to the downward blue resistance line, and then bleed back down.\n\nWe need to get a confirmation (new formation) entirely above the trend line before I am convinced that are on the way back up.\n\nAs they said in the movie \xe2\x80\x9c2010\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9csomething is going to happen.

Despite everything, the majority of people are not aware it exists.\n\n2. People want to be sold a single package that works. Part of the reason people are willing to spend an extra $60 on a new computer for a "set up". There are no Linux end-user machines at bestbuy. You would have to take some form of action or interest to change from windows. A lot of people who purchase Mac computers are in the group who don\'t want a windows machine but are unaware of their alternatives.\n\nFor more advanced users, there is the issue of drivers with some systems. I am unaware of the situation now but previously switchable graphics in notebooks were a big compatibility problem. Manufacturers, especially GPU makers, pay a lot more attention to windows drivers. Which brings up gamers, also. OpenGL is rarely used with DX being dominant. There are workarounds and emulation but for many it is not worth the effort.\n\nAs for corporate, programs are often made for windows, and even in the basic environment, 100% compatibility with Microsoft Office is essential.

Their abilities, usefulness and functionality have steadily improved to allow them to expand the possible devices. What I mentioned above is what prevents adoption in non-budget laptops and desktops.

The first industry is global sports betting which comprises an estimated $1 trillion volume (http://www.statista.com/topics/1740/sports-betting/) and the second is global remittances which comprises an annual volume of $450 billion  dollars. So if Bitcoin eventually was 20% of just those two markets that would give all Bitcoin in existence a valuation of $290 billion dollars divided by 15 million units (in a year or so) gives each unit a value of $19,333.  That\'s a modest fraction of just two industries. That\'s not even counting other forms of gambling. That\'s not factoring all the other vice financial markets there are. Nor all the privacy related markets such as purchasing anonymous VPNs in freedom starved areas. That disregards all the potential stock markets that could be built on side chains and all the people who just want a non inflating store of value as an alternative to their precious metals and property holdings.  That\'s disregarding so many potential uses that haven\'t even been thought of yet.  The point is, the market cap of Bitcoin right now is around $4.5 billion dollars which is like a drop of water in the ocean of World financial markets. Just considering how much press it gets the market cap is way too small. It\'s had several cover features on major worldwide magazines. Google has a market cap of $366 billion right now, Facebook, $149 billion; Apple, $463 billion; if Bitcoin today had a market cap that matched Apple it would be $35,000 per coin.

After repeated communications between OKcoin management and the bank, we immediately send out the following notice:\n\nHere's the situation after our discussion with the bank:\n\n1. The Xierqi branch of CMB was notified by upper management to temporarily cease deposit services for OKcoin at CMB, beginning April 14.\n\n2. The notice was oral. The branch has not received any written instructions.\n\n\nDetails on temporary halting of bank card deposits.\n\nOKcoin will officially stop taking deposits through its CMB Xierqi branch account on Monday (April 14). Customer withdrawals will continue as normal. OKcoin will release any new information immediately.\n\n\nAfter the bad news, there is always good news:\n\nThough the policy adjustment has certainly had an affect on the bitcoin market in China, OKcoin stands as a trading platform followed and trusted by bitcoin investors, and as such, we have always been preparing in good weather for various sudden events, doing our best to protect investor interests. With regards to this current adjustment of policy, we have made the following preparations:\n\n1 Official release of a new deposit method--Okcoin deposit code service\n\nIn order to facilitate deposits and withdrawals by our customers, OKcoin will release a deposit code function as the bank service closes. Users can withdraw money as a deposit code, which they can then sell to other OKcoin users to make deposits. \n\nThese deposit codes have no fees for withdrawals or deposits. OKcoin deposit codes can be freely traded between customers, with deposits and withdrawals available immediately.\n\nDeposit codes come in two parts, A and B. A is mainly for checking the validity and balance of the deposit code, while part B is used for making deposits. Deposits can only be made with the two codes together. When a RMB withdrawal is made for a deposit code, the A and B parts of the code will be generated simultaneously.\n\n2 OKcoin's overseas station will provide a trading platform that is a stabler and safer investment environment for domestic bitcoin traders. Coming soon.\n\nOKcoin's overseas station will provide a trading platform that is a stabler and safer investment environment for domestic bitcoin traders. Connected to the existing domestic site, it will provide bitcoin enthusiasts with a thoughtful, perfected and safe new trading platform for international services.\n\nWe are feverishly working on construction of the international site, and customers will see it very soon. Information on related services and instructions for customer use will be shared with everyone once the site is online.\n\nLastly, we would like to thank everyone who has supported us, cared for us and grown together with us. We have faith that this policy storm will not be the end of bitcoin in China, but will serve as a test for bitcoin trading platforms, with their mixed developmental records. It is because of your faith in us that OKcoin is here today. We also hope that we can continue to move forward, hand in hand, creating a financial legend that belongs to Chinese bitcoin people!

But having watched it unfold live, it was very very quick.": 2, "I think the reason why that isn't the case is because of the liquidity pool. The market cap and general size of the currency needs to be very large to support that kind of global economy.

There are two obvious ways to think about this:\n\nA.) Bitcoin companies provide easier avenues for traditional investors compared to a much less traditional investment like bitcoin.  \n\nThis notion is generally popular within this community, and probably rings true in a lot of cases.  What people may neglect is this:\n\nB.) Bitcoin related companies can be profitable even if BTC itself never skyrockets. \n\nI never see people bring this up, but it makes a lot of sense.  Coinbase or Bitpay are likely to make money hand-over-fist even if bitcoin never gains more traction than it does now.  Right now Bitcoin has ~$20million in trade volume *every day*. That's $7.3billion a year.  \n\nEven if it maintained that current level, a payment processor or trading platform could make a good deal of money considering overhead costs could remain fairly low.  Eventually a few market leaders will emerge that will likely handle the bulk of all trading/payment processing.   The VCs throwing money at bitcoin-related companies could just as well hope that they choose the right horse for that pool, even if the pool doesn't increase any larger than it is.  \n\n______\n\nI'm not going to argue that all investors are thinking option B (because that's almost certainly not the case), but I wouldn't be surprised if many think that way.  \n\nI guess the point I'm trying to make is that I'm not completely convinced that VC money is a strong indicator of where the market is going to go.  Until that money starts going into actual BTC buying, I'm not convinced that the future is as bright as others make it out to be. \n": 2, "> I happen to think it will go in a certain direction, but I won't discredit the fact that there is a possibility that bitcoin is about as saturated as it ever will be.\n\nI don't think so. Publicly traded ETF's and institutionalized American or Brittish exchanges have not launched yet, meaning the average investor on his Etrade or Scottrade accoutn can not yet invest in the currency itself or ANY Bitcoin firm. This will change, and this will make another order or magnitude of difference. Look how big Second Market got with a minimum $250,000 buy-in.\n\nSee my post here:\nhttp://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/22n39j/charts_that_show_a_total_or_near_total_collapse/cgofo8t\n\nI believe it's all or just about nothing. With the kind of growth we see with each new wave of adoption, I simply fail to see how millions more can start to use it for it's function but it's value stay the same. Every wave of new adoption we have had has increased the price drastically. Meanwhile, Wall Street has barely touched it; the largest exchanges in the world are based in Hong Kong (Bitfinex), Slovenia (Bitstamp is technically the UK but sssshhh), and who the fuck knows where (BTCe).\n\n": 2, "Yeah but that's nothing new.

The run up was less obviously manipulated and seemed a little more real, with a lot of smaller buys. It was certainly driven and helped along by large buys, which could also have been manipulation, but there were none of the too-obvious and too-large buy walls driving up the price like we saw during the 710 spike. This rally seemed to just be people market buying left and right, with a feel for 339 having been the true bottom.\n\nYesterday when it looked like we had bottomed out and were on the rise a whale came through and first put a 1500 coin sell order on the books, right above the then-current price, then started market selling large amounts. That's what caused the final drop to 339 on Stamp. Then we bounced, hard. I don't know if that whale was part of the bounce, too, but with that level of overt manipulation I would certainly think they knew what they were doing.

Take that into consideration...\n\nHere are my thoughts and how I normally approach a trade.\n\nFirst, I pick a time scale. I normally like to trade at a fairly slow rate, and I found that using 15 minute candles gets me more or less in a comfortable frequency. Next, I pick a currency to use as my score. Pick either fiat or BTC, but not both. Your goal is to increase this score even if it comes as the expense of the other. For me, I really truly believe in BTC long term, so I prefer increasing my BTC over my fiat.\n\nNow, you have to understand that the point of TA is to model human behavior, and it is not so good at it. We tend to remember the times it works and forget the times it doesn\'t. So I don\'t try to be a fortune teller. Instead, I combine StochRSI and MACD with my own general "gut feeling" on the market to produce a "yes" or "no" answer to the following questions: is now a good time to buy, and is now a good time to sell?\n\nA good place to get a general feeling on the market is here. The flair game helps but reading comments is better. If lots of people are super bearish, this often means that good news will do very little, and bad news will drive the market. If lots of people are super bullish, it\'s the other way around. While you can\'t predict whether a crash or rally *will* happen, you can get a feel for the subjective probabilities.\n\nIf the general sentiment is bullish, but the RSI and MACD are low - it\'s probably a good time to buy. If the general sentiment is bearish, but the RSI and MACD are high - it\'s probably a good time to sell. And then, of course, buy and sell as needed to get back into or out of the market if you think you just made a bad trade. If a trade will make you a decent profit, and you\'re not sure if the opportunity will remain, just take it.\n\nThat\'s all I do, and it\'s gotten me from 3 BTC to 7 BTC since November.\n\nI\'m also a buy-and-hold type person as well. I haven\'t made a single trade since February, partly because I\'m traveling, partly because I believe so strongly in BTC that I think 7 BTC might turn out to be quite a lot in the future. I am not so desperate to increase this count further.\n\nNo need to make a bot. And a bot can\'t make subjective decisions based on general market sentiment like you can. In that sense, I consider them inferior.': 3, 'I just picked up the too to add to the reading list.  Thanks!\n\nI appreciate how everyone stops to ask themselves a few questions before they make the trade.

It's difficult to explain exactly how this factor affects the market in any particular way but it for sure has a big affect and patterns can be seen. For example, recently China has been leading the market movements when it's daytime there, and they have been very bullish, as can be seen with the last rally to the 540s which happened during their day and the west's night. \nAnother relevant observation related to this is how Huobi's price has been higher than stamp and btc-e, a sign that they have been leading rallies, as opposed to how their price was lower than non-china exchanges during the recent china-FUD crash phase.\n\n\nI think factors like these are way more useful and reliable than the typical TA I see here that is based just on charts/past performance/trends, technical indicators and such..": 2, "An excellent approach as far as I can see - once you're already in the clear for making money, move your stop loss to ensure you take your profit if it begins to fall again!": 2, "Thanks for the great advice!

I think about my entrance point and exit point. \n\nTake Dogecoin for example, since I trade in it more and make fewer bigger moves in bitcoin. I opened a long position on April 2nd at 105 ssatoshis when it was on its way down. I entered there with the expectation the market would continue to go down, however I didn't think it would go down much further in the next couple weeks, and I expected it would hit another spike in the next couple months. I didn't expect it to drop much lower than 90, but I think it went all the way to 83 or so at its lowest in the past couple weeks. I exited yesterday, taking a 25% gain on this latest upshoot. The peak ended up around 150, and my exit was well under that...\n\nBut when I was exiting, I compared my exit to my entrance point, and I decided the difference between the two was greater than the difference I expected between my exit and the peak. I also didn't want to let it ride overnight, when the sudden gain could evaporate by the time I woke up.\n\nSo basically, I look at the difference between my entrance and exit, and compare that to my expectations about how far I expect the market to go.

But I have the nerves and patience and skills to do so I guess. \n\nFamous last words before someone loses all their money. One does not simply jump into day trading.\n\nHere is what you do. Make an account here:\n\nhttp://currencytycoon.com/\n\nSpend only the money you planned on jumping into day trading with, and play that game as if you were actually using real money.\n\nPeople say "buy low, sell high," but the problem is, you\'ll never actually know how high "high" is, or how low "low" is. Instead, you\'ll actually panic sell low when you think the market is about to crash and you\'re trying not to lose all your money. And you\'ll give into greed and buy when it\'s high in order to try to ride "rallies" upward.\n\nIf you are looking at Bitcoin as a means of making money, you only have two sane options. The first is, you figure out an amount that you are fully okay with losing. An amount that, if you lost it, it would not really change your life very much at all. From that amount, spend a few millibits on BIP38-encrypted paper wallets; I recommend the Bit Card from Germany. Get several copies of your cards so you can distribute them as backups. When you get the card, use the rest of the initial amount to buy bitcoins, and load them all into that card\'s address. \n\nThen distribute the cards to people/institutions you trust, and promptly forget about it. Wait as long as you can. I recommend at least 10 years. 15 or 20 would be better. Just make sure someone you trust knows how to access your bitcoins should something happen to you. You can set up a trust to release to them half the passphrase if you die/get in a coma for a week, or something.\n\nBut don\'t bother even watching the markets. Otherwise, you might make an emotional decision. Just let it rock. Remember that after hitting a high of $266, BTC fell to $50 before going back up. Anyone who sold at $266 or $50 then would be mad if they saw the price today.\n\nThe other great option (and the one I personally follow) would be to buy your way in gradually. Figure out how much money you have left over each week after paying bills. Take a small portion of that, $20, $100, whatever, and buy that much bitcoin every week or two, sending it all into the paper wallet I mentioned earlier. Feel free to keep a little spending money in a web wallet, but make sure most of your money is in the paper wallet. And just let it build up. That way, you hedge against volatility, as well. If you buy consistently, it won\'t matter that it\'s low or high; you\'ll just have a bunch of bitcoins when all is said and done.': 14}, ('CRInvestor and Flibbr Bitcoin Show', 14): {"I wish I had the time but I have other engagements tonight.

As suggested the other day, we dropped down into the $480\xe2\x80\x99s, but we\xe2\x80\x99ve moved back into a column of Xs, popping above the $500 again this afternoon/evening.\n\nWe are not approaching a Break out signal at $530, and the Break down signal is now under $475.  The higher lows of this formation are bullish.  We remain above the resistance line, and every day we move to the right above the line is a good thing.  The trend reversal point os under $370 now.  It is good to see that line move upward as well\xe2\x80\x94as long as the price maintains a pretty good distance from it.\n\nI do not see up breaking out from this point, at least unless there is a significant catalyst.  The formation is five columns wide\xe2\x80\x94and that is a decent formation size.  if we were to \xe2\x80\x9cpop\xe2\x80\x9d now, we could see the high $500\xe2\x80\x99s in short order.\n\nI think if we were going much lower, we would have done it by now.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the worldwide events are going to impact us:  Ukraine stays at the top of the list.

Anecdotally, the home next door was abandoned right before Christmas 2012.  We are now coming into the second spring without any action on it.
