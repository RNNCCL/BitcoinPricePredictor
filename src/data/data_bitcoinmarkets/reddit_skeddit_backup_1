In contrast, the DASH pre-mine was about 10% of total capacity.\n\nCould bitcoin potentially hardfork its way to being the best technology crypto?  Sure in theory.

You don't even have to wait until Jan 1st to buy them back.\n\nIn tax terms, every time you make a purchase/trade with any non-Canadian currency (speaking as a Canadian citizen), you would have to calculate the foreign exchange gain/loss on that currency between the time you acquired it and the time you spent it. I believe most countries follow similar tax rulings. So if you buy 1 BTC for $300 and spend/trade it for $400 you would have a $100 gain. This becomes a pain in the ass if you plan on using it on a daily basis for small purchases because each $5 purchase may contain gains/losses if the value fluctuated.\n\nIn terms of just trading.  If you have say 10 BTC in your wallet with a total cost of $3000 and you send 1 BTC to an exchange to trade, the adjusted cost base(ACB) of that 1 BTC is $300 which is now a part of a separate costing pool than the wallet (meaning any gains are losses are strictly related to that coin and not the wallet coins). Technically every single trade you make would have a gain/loss. But the simplest way to calculate it would be to calculate the value as of the last trade you made at the end of the year or just before you withdraw the BTC/funds. (this only works if you don't deposit/withdraw any more coins, otherwise you would have to make adjustments). So you could trade that 1 BTC and make $10,000 mid year and then lose most of it and be left with $500 in your trading account on December 31st. Your gain for the year is just the $500 less the initial $300 cost base of the coin. This is much simpler than going through the history of potentially thousands of trades. In the new year, the ACB of the coin would be the realized value ($500) so if the value goes back down to $300, that would be a $200 loss for your 2016 taxes. \n\nEx 2: Starting with the same BTC, if midyear you increased your trading BTC/money to 2BTC (or $800 balance at $400/BTC) and you withdrew 1 BTC ($400) to your wallet and continued to trade with the other 1 BTC. Your wallet would now hold 10 BTC at a cost base of $3,100 (9@$300 + the additional 1@$400). Your ACB of your wallet coins are now $310/BTC. At this time your capital gain would be $500. If you continued to trade with the other 1BTC/$400 and lose half of it by the end of the year (so you have 0.5BTC or $200), your capital gain for the year would then be just $300. Even if the price per coin is now $400, the original 9 BTC you held in your wallet don't have a realized gain or loss until they are exchanged for cash/altcoins or spent.\n\nIn the end (if 10 years down the road you sell all your BTC), the final gain/loss figure would be all the money you you received/spent less all the money you invested into Bitcoin. So if you invested $10,000 and throughout the 10 years you withdrew $20,000 and spent $5,000 on purchases, the combined gain over that 10 year period would be $15,000.\n\nHopefully this answers your questions. To simplify tax calculations though, it's best to try to keep your trading coins separate from coins you're holding as you can just calculate gains or losses as the change in value of your trade account (while making adjustments for any other deposits/withdrawals as necessary).": 2, "I've checked out bitcoin.tax and it's a fantastic website. I love that it auto-generates the 8949 form - there is no way you can do that by hand. It seems silly that you need to fill out 100+ pages for just a few dollars in taxes.": 1, "No. Your cost will be the same for the coins whether you buy them before or after year end. If you purchase 1 coin for $400 on December 31 2015 or 1 for $400 on January 1 2016, your cost for calculating gains or losses on that coin will be the same in 2016 regardless ($400).\n\nIf after you sell/close positions near year end and calculate your gains and losses you then open a new position, as long as that position isn't closed, any changes in value will be unrealized until it is closed. So if you enter a long on December 31 and the price increases, nothing is realized until you close the position and lock in profits.\n\nSo if someone opened a long back in October before the recent rise and still holds the position open, no gains are reported on that position in 2015. They would be reported in 2016 (or whenever the position is closed).": 0, 'No problem. Many thanks for the tip.': 1, "Well, if you wanted. I'm just pointing out that from a gains/losses perspective, there is no need to track all the cost basis for each coin you bought/sold and each altcoin you traded, if you do it all within the same tax year. You could, of course, but it would work out the same.\n\nHowever, once they span tax years, things start getting more complicated and you'll probably need to calculate it for each transaction.": 1, "I'm facing the same issue. My first idea was to simply compute the USD equivalent of my cryptocurrencies on Jan 1 and Dec 31, and then subtract the difference to compute my gain/loss.\n\nHowever, I don't think you can simply average the cost of all your trades. Essentially you have to compute the gain/loss for every single transaction and fill out a 8949 form: https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8949.pdf\n\nFor example, if you bought 1 BTC @100USD/BTC on Oct 1 and sold them on Nov 1 @110USD/BTC then you would fill in:\n\n>  (a) 1 BTC (b) 10/1/2015 (c) 11/1/2015 (d) 110 (e) 100 (h) 10\n\nIn my case, the amount of BTC I buy and sell usually doesn't match up. For example, instead you could have bought 0.6 BTC @100USD/BTC on Oct 1 and 0.4 BTC @105USD/BTC on Oct 2:\n\n>  (a) 0.6 BTC (b) 10/1/2015 (c) 11/1/2015 (d) 66 (e) 60 (h) 6  \n>  (a) 0.4 BTC (b) 10/2/2015 (c) 11/1/2015 (d) 44 (e) 42 (h) 2\n\nThe first BTC purchased are the first sold, which is called First In First Out (FIFO). To start, you would find your first sell for X amount. Then you would go through all your buys until you have covered that X amount. Next, repeat this for your second sell and so on. \n\nI've done over 1000 transactions in 2015 so I plan on writing a matlab script that computes this for me. However, I started trading on coinbase in October last year and did only earn a few hundred dollars. So maybe I'll just be lazy (and stupid) and start doing this for 2016. One problem is that I sold more than I bought which complicates things. I would have to compute long-term capital gains for bitcoins that I bought prior to 2015 and ended up selling on coinbase.": 2, "Something to definitely keep in mind. A quick reading of [wash sale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wash_sale) sounds like the main purpose is to disallow the practice of using the quick trade to realize losses for tax deductions. They also specify the sale of a security while Bitcoin was classified as a commodity if I'm not mistaken(the rules surrounding Bitcoin are still fuzzy).\n\nIf someone is trading numerous altcoins and just wants to close and reopen their positions for USD at year end to simplify gain/loss calculations, I don't see it being an issue as long as it's not a material difference. If by doing so their loss is much different than it would of been had they not have, they might run into some issues. \n\n[It also only applies to losses as well](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/understanding-the-wash-sale-rules-2015-03-02).

The higher the transaction volume, the lower the gas price. \n\n\nAlso, spam transactions are not forwarded by Ethereum. \nProof-of-stake replacing proof-of-work will decrease the load on mining for hashes and push the gas price even further.\n\nThis was also confirmed to us by the Ethereum developers, which has provided us with more confidence about our decision to use the protocol for a centralised organisation to operate with a decentralised application. \n': 2, 'Sup Pizpie.': 2, "Yeah..

Deposit BTC to a wallet address found on the Plutus app.  2.) This deposit, acting as a Buy order for fiat, is filled immediately by traders whose funds are in escrow.  3.) These escrow funds are released to the user\xe2\x80\x99s virtual debit card (VDC) almost immediately, and the traders in turn receive the BTC they have \xe2\x80\x9cbought\xe2\x80\x9d from the users who initiated the process.': 1, "> 100\n\nWhat I'm afraid of with dapps, is gas manipulation, a PnD, or whatever, manipulaing the price of gas. Bitcoin was once considered super cheap to mine as well, gas might not maintain this.\n\nIf gas bloats for some unknown reason, would you be able to cope? Plans to a server to take over? I know this is speculation, but no one seems to ever take this scenario into mind - if ETH becomes successful I would totally expect this to occur at least once. Much like the recent fees fiasco with the spammed TXs on bitcoins chain.": 1, 'Even though scaling is not currently the issue on ethereum, steps are being taken with new updates such as ["sharding"](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/53) "(defined either as "can safely process 10000+ tx/sec" or "transaction processing capacity quadratic in the processing power of a single node")"\n\n\nCurrent gas price is 20gwei according to [Ethstats](https://ethstats.net/). This means that 100000 gas would cost 0.00002 Ether or around \xe2\x82\xac0.00014. Compared to the costs of a server to operate a centralised exchange, this is still very cost efficient and comes with many other benefits: such as transparency for users, as well as being able to issue a decentralised rebate system.': 3, 'The value comes from instant deposits, free conversions and is determined by the marketplace. There is no need for the merchant to accept any digital currency as users will be able to convert their Pluton balance directly from the app to a virtual debit card, which is then accepted at any store with a NFC-enabled terminal. The incentive for the trader, is no fee on the PlutusDEX, which will enable traders to purchase both bitcoin and plutons directly from users redeeming the tokens on the app. They can then hold their digital assets in Plutons to later use on the app or trade externally.\n\nBefore the rebate is issued to the app user, the token contract calculates the value of emission by the last completed trade for Plutons on the DEX network.\n\nThe only other way for users outside the payment system to obtain Plutons is via the PlutusDEX, or from traders that purchased them through the DEX, this limitation ensures liquidity for conversions on the Plutus app as well as keeping the external supply minimal while demand for usage grows. And because the supply is limited and will remain low on rebate, will naturally boost the demand for plutons because of its unique use-case. Obviously we cannot predict how the ecosystem will react, but we have built our platform (and Plutons) with stability and growth in mind. Either way, the end result will not influence functionality of the platform itself. Users will be able to continue using Plutus as always, no matter the outcome.\n': 2, "> Why no whois icann info?\n\n[Whois info](https://who.godaddy.com/whoisstd.aspx?domain=plutus.it&prog_id=GoDaddy)\n\n\n> Allows you to purchase bitcoin with 0% trading and 0% deposit and 0% withdrawal fees.\n>So how do you guys pay the bills then?\n\nWe charge a fee for Bitcoin to virtual debit card (fiat) conversions on the app, which enables us to offer a zero fee experience for the traders on the DEX, who provide the fuel for the payment system.\n\n> Runs on Ethereum, why is this better than your own servers? Have you found any pros or cons with Gas usage and pricing yet?\n\nRunning an exchange on our own servers or using a third-party service to convert Bitcoin to fiat is always the easier option to implement, however, this convenience has many caveats which essentially means that we would become a wallet service. This would exposes the Plutus payment system to essentially the same risks as the exchange itself. The decision to use Ethereum was primarily because of the ability to create a peer to peer exchange with only fiat escrow as a centralised point. This means Plutus operates entirely without holding any users digital funds in a wallet.\n\nThe transaction (Gas) cost in Ethereum is not really known and fluctuates,  as the network is still growing. It is still very low though,  and nothing compared to  traditional banking transaction costs. So the fees are eaten by Plutus, which  enables us to offer a zero fee incentive for traders on the DEX to boost the payment system.\n\n> Where is Dex and why isn't it up yet?\n\nThe DEX is currently under development, and a roadmap will be released next week, which will go into more detail of where the project is currently, and the milestones that we have set moving forward.\n\n> Why is this better than my CC? does it take longer than the already hated chips in the new CCs?\n\nPlutus is first and foremost intended to be a practical application for Bitcoin users to be able to simply download the app, send Bitcoin and then tap and pay at any NFC-enabled merchant. Under the hood, the BTC deposit is converted via a peer to peer network of traders registered to buy BTC with fiat. The fiat is in escrow, which is then released to the contactless balance on the app. \n\n>The Plutus payment system operates entirely without holding any user's digital funds.\n> Is this because of the ethereum contract?\n\nYes, this is explained above in more detail.\n\n> Or are you more realistic?\n\nDefinitely! The intention is to be practical and provide a service which simply enables easy Bitcoin payments at merchants that don\xe2\x80\x99t accept it. The app itself is not limited to strictly Bitcoin deposits either - Other use-cases, such as direct fiat deposit to a prepaid virtual debit card will also be an option in the future.\n\n> EDIT: Welcome to /r/bitcoinmarkets, where we belittle almost every startup asking for us to use their crap.\n\nThanks for the welcome, it\xe2\x80\x99s a pleasure to be here. :)\n\n": 6, 'Great AMA guys!': 3, '> We are starting an AMA on Thursday 6 pm GMT\n\nApologies for the confusion, we were suppose to start at a later time.': 3, 'I think they added that in the edit 13 hours ago.': 1, "so how much do Plutons cost you?

It was literally minutes after I posted how boring things had become.  Well, it broke through the $420 box and went into the $425 box for a true break out.  We peaked yesterday at a high of $426.50 at Coinbase.\n\nOf course, today the breakout looks pretty anemic.  Which is OK as long as we do not reverse the columns again by dipping below $415.  \n\nI am sure there were a ton of folks that bought the last dip to the $400 level who were thrilled with their $20 gain.  I would be as well.\n\nThe issue with the price just simply shooting up like that is the number of folks with trigger fingers that want to pick up a dollar or two on their futures contracts.  It was a wonderful opportunity to do that.\n\nSo I have to suggest what the chart says, and this time I am not in total agreement.  Due to the width of the formation one of the rules says to add the number of boxes of the width of the formation (9 columns) to the break out point.  That would get you to the $470 range. \n\nThe second method for predicting the strength of the break out is to measure the last break out a d suggest it will duplicate that formation.  The last time we broke out to the upside was from $395 to $445 back in February.  That run was 11 boxes high.  If you overlay that column on this column, the peak hits $450.\n\nMy thoughts today are that these predictions will probably come through, but not on this go around.  I think we drop back to the $420 range,  and maybe a little lower.  Then we can move up higher with some conviction.  In all honesty, I think this was some guy in Europe with a ton of cash he took out of the bank getting negative interest and they decided to buy some bitcoin.  It was too early in the day for China, unless they were still up from the night before which means it was a drunk trade.  \n\nSo, that is where we are today.  Not sad about where it moved.  But my optimism level is still around 5-5, or 6.0.\n\n**[Chart of the Day](http://i.imgur.com/Gj4rRAq.png)**\n\nResources\n\nSource:  Bitcoinwisdom chart for Coinbase based on their definition of days.

Instantly, 3K BTC bid/ask gets placed, and matched. *If* another order from someone else slipped in the partial match, then there would be potentially a standing order left on the books, that again potentially may not be filled.

Buying GBTC in a brokerage account is no different than buying bitcoin or futures from a tax perspective. You\'ll pay short term / long term cap gains on any profits just the same, so you have the same incentives from a tax standpoint for all products (unless you\'re cheating uncle sam, because vanguard will surely report your GBTC gains, but the exchanges? hah). GBTC becomes worth it over futures / actual bitcoin *only* when you put it in a tax advantaged account like an IRA. And since IRA\'s are tax advantaged you won\'t pay taxes from any gains until withdrawal (if it\'s a traditional IRA) meaning all the profits you roll over can be put into a new position, regardless of how long you hold. That\'s where GBTC is valuable. So, I disagree that there\'s any incentive to hold GBTC longer than you would any other position, because you shouldn\'t be using it if it\'s not in a tax advantaged account, and if it\'s in a tax advantaged account, short term / long term doesn\'t matter.': 5, "It's not the only way to get exposure to bitcoin in tax advantaged accounts.

If we had planned on adding eth since the beginning, wouldn\'t we have dealt with the rollout much better? Wouldn\'t we have contacted at least a couple of charting sites asking them to add our eth pair to their charts? Or at least contact some media and get a bit of fanfare around the launch? Wouldn\'t we have taken care of the updated trading balance calculations needed for eth margin trading so that it wouldn\'t take several weeks to go live with margin on eth?

Media & Outreach: Draft a pr, talk to some media outlets, talk to other services that will be affected by this launch (e.g., charting sites)\n5. Announcement and launch: Announce your product, move forward with media, talk to users and the community, and launch your product. \n\nNotice how there weren\'t any test groups for ETH, we didn\'t reach out and try to have anyone help test like we generally do with big changes, there wasn\'t any media outreach, no charting sites had our ETH pair, etc. \n\n>Reputation in the bitcoin world is hard to earn and keep.\n\nThis is very true, that\'s why we\'re going to continue working and improving the product as that\'s the only way to to earn and keep a good reputation. \n\n>Completely focus on bitcoin.\n>>I think if Bitfinex focused on the bitcoin market \n\nIf you look at what I said when I first joined Bitfinex it was that I liked that Bitfinex was focused on building the best bitcoin exchange in the world. One of my favorite things about Bitfinex is that we all are huge bitcoin enthusiasts, that\'s where our interests lie. We nerd out on bitcoin related things all the time. At OKCoin the vast majority of the employees (sans the international team) couldn\'t care less about bitcoin and have never even used it. At Bitfinex we\'re wholly devoted to btc, that\'s why we invested in Blockstream, that\'s why we took part in things like the Bitcoin roundtable, and why I plan to do more to help core in the near future. I have always stated that I don\'t really care about the alts too much, I own something like 0.09 eth that I bought shortly after we launched so I could test transferring eth and trying to use it. The only LTC i\'ve ever had (like 0.2) was sent to me in a test we were doing. The only other alt I own is Darkcoin which I bought 25 like 2 years ago and haven\'t even used once. I, along with the rest of team, are absolutely bitcoin maximalists. Another example, look at the [ETH article on Coindesk](http://www.coindesk.com/ethereum-bitfinex-ether-trading/) about us:\n\n>Tackett took steps to maintain that Bitfinex is still a "bitcoin company first" despite the addition of ether. \n\nThis turned into a really long post, sorry about that, but I feel like I\'ve stated my views pretty clearly. \n\n': 1, "We're not poking bears.

I keep hearing different numbers.\n\n>The current proposal for soft fork segregated witness (segwit) replaces the block size limit with a new block cost limit, counting each byte of witness data as 1 unit of cost and UTXO transaction data as 4 units; as a result, the maximum size of a block becomes just under 4 MB.  However, blocks are not expected to consist entirely of witness data, so blocks near 4 MB in size would be unlikely.  According to some calculations performed by Anthony Towns, a block filled with standard single-signature P2PKH transactions would be about 1.6 MB and a block filled with 2-of-2 multisignature transactions would be about 2.0 MB.

I know that is not an exact science, but I will work on that as well.\n\nIn any event, we have broken out pretty well.  The recent high was $443.05, which puts us two boxes above the breakout.  The good news is that it moves us further away from the trend line.\n\nSo here are the figures:\n\nReversal to column of Os happens if the price drops below $430.\nA Negative Breakdown is all the way back to $405.\nA long term trend reversal happens under $415.\n\nWe met the short term objective of the break out by going above $435.  This was based on the \xe2\x80\x9clast breakout\xe2\x80\x9d method.  The last breakout was pretty lame.\n\nThe count based on the width of the formation is still far away at $485.  I think hitting that might take a while.  I foresee some $450 resistance and some slogging it through all the way to $500.  So be ready for a couple of pull backs.  You might even see a reversal to a column of Os in prep for a move further up.\n\nAll in all, my optimism is at about a 7.5.  Every time I think we are slowing it pops up another $5.

I could imagine a slower timescale and somewhat smoother rise, as you would expect in a more mature marketplace.\n\nThe question is about how you define "cheap".  I just learned about bitcoin last year and started buying in the low $200s.  To me, based on the potential, they have always been "cheap".  I don\'t see why a $7B market cap isn\'t still cheap really.  It is hilariously cheap if this actually becomes "digital gold" for future generations.  If the market cap was even 1% of that of gold, the price would be more like $4K per coin.  If 10% the marketcap of gold (which is basically just a store of value that people trust, rarely used in commerce, etc.)  The price per coin would be about $40K each.  $40K per coin is the number the Winklevoss twins put out as a reasonable future expectation, well before the ATH and it was based on some possible assumptions.  If it were to become the world reserve currency replacing the dollar (very unlikely, but not impossible) the coins would probably be about $1M each.  These are possible not guaranteed and they are future valuations, possibly distant future valuations.... but if that future were to ever become a reality, what would the chart look like between here and there.  We won\'t just wake up one day and see $40K coins.\n\nGBTC trades at over $70....  those investors must think $460 is cheap.\nThe Bitmex September 30 expiration trades at $620.  So $460 is cheap to those traders, who must see the price rise to $620 by expiration to break even.\nThere aren\'t ANY liquid bitcoin options for distant dates (really not even a few months).  I think it\'s because they would be really tough to price because of the potential for exponential price growth, so no one wants to make that market.\nOKCoin quarterly futures have a $30 premium right now.  Lot of premium.\nBFX margin interest rates necessitate a pretty healthy rise to make it worth borrowing to trade that way.\nLocalBitcoins are sold at a large premium and in significant volumes.\nCoinbase has a premium.  That is as close to retail US buyer driven as could be.\n\nPeople seem to think these premiums are just a given, but they aren\'t.  All these groups could be wrong for sure, but there are a lot of people putting their money up with expectations of a major price move.  If hodlers were really wanting to cash out big they might sell on localbitcoins at a discount instead of dumping on exchanges.\nFutures can have negative premiums, and they have at times with bitcoin in the last year (even the last few weeks at times on the weeklies before the consolidation triangle resolved).\n\nWhy would the smart money be all the other exchanges?  Could the smart money not have been working the price down on the exchanges while buying OTC?  It\'s really pretty clear that the price is worked down on the exchanges with market sell orders into thin books.  I\'ve seen that routinely since watching the charts last year.  The entire pattern is a pretty clear accumulation pattern.  It just looks like skillfull accumulation.\n\nReal money can\'t play here very easily.  Bitcoin needs better investment vehicles, and those would make a big difference.  But really the big boys can\'t trade an asset with this market cap.  It would need to be quite a bit higher.\n\nI think the idea that bitcoin can\'t go up because too many people expect that is also pretty absurd.  There is still a ton of money on the sidelines.

Thank you.': 1, 'That Kraken BID order though...': 1, '1D Squeezes going for several days now on both stamp and finex. *no* squeezes (per ttm squeeze) on huobi or okc. Such a strange situation really. It comes down to either the bollinger bands being *less* tight in the east, or the keltner channels being *more* tight in the east. I\'m leaning towards the latter. The no fee structure causes tighter movements during periods of low volatility and since the keltner channel is based on ATR rather than std dev (which is what the bollinger bands are based on), this is causing the keltner channels in the east to *barely* still be inside the bollinger bands (or rather, enough at least to prevent the BB from moving *inside* the KC), and thus not *officially* triggering the squeeze indicator. Adjusted for USD, the ATR in the east is about 10% lower than the west. Make sense? \n\nEdit: BTCUSD on OKCoin is squeezing, but BTCCNY is not. BTCUSD has fees, BTCCNY does not. I think my above explanation is looking more likely, i.e., the no fees of the east cause tighter keltner channels during periods of low volatility due to profitable arbitrage and bot running that isn\'t profitable to run in the west / on fee exchanges (like okcoin btcusd...) during periods of slow price movement.\n\nEdit 2: interestingly, OKC and Huobi didn\'t squeeze in october right before the big bubble like stamp and finex did. I guess since this is happening again, and the above explanation, it kind of makes sense. I bet there\'s a way to tweak the ttm squeeze params (i.e. the params of the BB and KC) such that the east and west squeeze (historically) at the same time, but I bet that risks some overfitting. Understanding why the indicators are saying what they\'re saying is good enough for me.\n\nEither way, official "indicator" or not, it\'s squeezing plenty in the east, just look at the BB and KC on the charts. Like I said, I think this is just because the east is more efficient (i.e. bots and arb between huobi and okc) at low volatility price discovery and arbitrage / market making. \n\n[Charts](http://imgur.com/a/OIwTB)': 6, 'Planted the seedlings today!

While it dropped fast and turned around and ended just slightly up it still dropped four boxes.  If you shorted I would wait and see what happens on Monday.\n\nThe VIX reversed as well.  During the first couple of hours of trading it popped up and then settled down.\n\nThe Odd Man Out was the S&P.  It was buoyed pretty well throughout the day.  But it is still a long tail--5 boxes above the breakout.  It is due for a reversal, even if it is a temporary one.\n\nIt seems that all of the markets are either waiting for the other shoe to drop, or some signal to race upwards.\n\nBack to bitcoin: in most of the Western Countries I suspect the Easter Weekend to add to the stale market.   Monday is a holiday in many of the Eurozone countries.  \n\nI am assuming that Easter Weekend is not a big deal in China.  If it is, someone please correct me.  I think it will  be interesting to see if thin trading in the west will impact the price when the "far east" is awake and doing business.  I think it is an academic curiosity.\n\nI cannot give any guidance at this point.  I seems that it is having a difficult time going one way or the other.\n\nFor those "celebrating" the Easter Holiday, I hope you have a nice day with family.  For the rest of the world, it is the begining of Spring.

I project the future that has already happened.    So\xe2\x80\xa6read on if you want to see what happened yesterday!\n\nWe broke into the $450 box yesterday so we climbed another box.  That move upward put this column into a long pole warning situation.  Until we get a reversal, this formation will be teetering on the edge.\n\nA long pole warning happens when the price moves up four boxes above the previous top.  Generally speaking, when the price makes a short term reversal ( under $440) expect it to fall about halfway down the pole.  On this chart, that decline would go at least to $425.  Of course, it has to reverse to get there.  \n\nIf we do not reverse, the formation count of 11 columns still calls for a high of around $485.  That price target is a three to four week target based on the break out on 4/15.\n\nThe best news is that the price exceeded the most recent high in the $445 box.  I have no opinion on whether this represents a break out from the numerous triangles posted lately.\n\nSo, how would I look to trade this?  I would look for a reversal down into the high $430s, and then bail out until the reversal completes in the $420s.

What I am doing is holding my quarterlies (up 146% at the moment) and I'm not trading out of them.  I am trading the weekly and biweekly.

My goal is to buy low enough to cover the weekly premium spread (right now $2 to $3).  It is hard to do really and my success has been mixed.\n\nThe last big run I did something similar opening shorts on the front weekly at times to burn that premium while staying largely long on the quarterlies having bought during consolidation.  I used cross margin and I kept growing my positions (you don't have to wait until settlement to reinvest using cross margin).  I thought I was OK because I had shorts offsetting most longs, but in different options.  I had a pretty large position, I think I was #3 on OKCoin, but the July DDOS wiped it out in 5 minutes because the move between weeklies wasn't in sinc.

We know there will still always be some disputes and we should specify right up front how they will be resolved.\n\n>Thirdly, we take into the account the reality of managing financial agreements; we need more than just a consensus system.

It seems like at least its influence on Bitcoin is vanishing since all new "MMM pays" videos appear to be about MMM South Africa where most of the participants use bank accounts rather than bitcoin. This may have been a response to the giant backlog at the beginning of March or maybe they mostly used bank accounts before as well. In general, it suggests that MMM peaked at the beginning of March. It is assumed that many MMM participants used the blockchain.info wallet for transactions. The [sharp drop in transaction counts for blockchain.info wallets](http://imgur.com/bWAkb6K) seems to coincide perfectly with [declining "MMM pays" video counts after the March peak](http://imgur.com/wydN046). Considering most videos after the peak now are from South Africa and they do not use bitcoin, it can be assumed that most MMM traffic has vanished from the bitcoin network. Luckily, it seems like the effects on price have been minimal. It is worth mentioning that the ponzi leader has stopped posting "news" on 20th of March. My theory is that he saw the decline and decided to pull all remaining money out (of MMM Global, MMM South Africa seems to still be running fine - but without bitcoin).\n\nUnrelated to MMM, the baseline transaction counts still show significant growth.

By saying that there\'s no trading fees and so it doesn\'t cost the exchange anything to wash volume is portraying the exchange as playing by the same rules as regular users. Unfortunately, that\'s not the truth, the exchange employs special orders that can\'t match with other users\' orders, that\'s not playing by the same rules. Even if these exchanges did have fees, they would (and probably do on their fee-charging products) still be able to inflate volumes, because of course they don\'t play by the same rules.\n\n>Because if higher transaction volumes make it seem like Bitcoin trading is a vibrant and bustling trade with millions of coins changing hands each month, whereas in reality there\'s a distinct possibility that "true" volume is completely dismal\n\n I think you missed the mark a bit here. It\'s not about making "bitcoin" or any other coin looking vibrant and bustling, it\'s about making that exchange look vibrant and bustling. The vast majority of chinese traders don\'t give 2 shits about any of bitcoin\'s ideology, perceived ability to overthrow the financial system or anything like that. They view it as a way to gamble and/or make money, that\'s it. The exchanges merely need to make their exchange vibrant and bustling and make people choose them over the competing exchanges. A good example of this is that OKCoin reports an LTC volume of over 20,000,000 LTC, this isn\'t to make LTC look bustling, it\'s to make okcoin look more bustling than Huobi\'s (502 bad gateway that i\'m currently getting isn\'t tough to beat) 10,000,000 LTC. \n\n>If I were trying to portray Bitcoin as a promising new technology with millions of users its pretty crucial to have accompanying volume\n\nAgain, it\'s not about bitcoin/litecoin whatever, it\'s about the appearance of the exchange. \n\n>there\'s essentially nowhere in China that you can actually use Bitcoin,\n\nI lived in China for over 4 years and was able to find the following places that you can use bitcoin:\n\n* Second place, a bar in Wudaokou -- closed\n* A phone top up service -- still works, used it all the time, great service.\n* I saw a picture once of a place in Qingdao that accepted bitcoin. \n\n>and certainly isn\'t used for remittances considering how little utility it has there.\n\nHere\'s where you are wrong, but that\'s because you\'re only thinking about it one direction.

They don\'t care about the tech, the price, or anything. They use it to send home and outside of that don\'t care about it.

Here\'s my take on what I\'m seeing around here at the moment, because it reminds me of October of last year. We were just coming up on 300 for the third time, and the ongoing meme was "this time it\'s different! /s". Even after 300 was broken with conviction and re-tested and bounced, people were relentlessly calling the top. Here\'s a run down of what the dailies looked like back in October of last year for those of you that weren\'t here:\n\n"Oh 300 broke? No worries, we\'ll turn around at 320 and tank". "300 broke? Means *nothing*. Next BIG resistance at 325. better short it now". "330 broke? This turns around at 345, 350 topps. Better short it!". "No fucking way this breaks 400. We shouldn\'t have even broken 300. Sell!". And it was at about 420 when the majority of people here *finally* came around and realized how important the taking of 300 actually was.\n\nI\'m not suggesting that taking 435 or etc is as important as taking 300, but this is a very critical level and I\'m seeing the same type of comments. Basically, when the price was less than 300 everyone seemed to agree that a breach of 300 would trigger big things. And it did. But everyone seemed to forget what they thought about 300 when it *actually* came. Half this sub went from calling a *huge* rally post-300 to constantly trying to call tops and short. Hindsight is 20/20 and all that, but I just want to remind you people to stick to your guns unless something is blatantly suggesting otherwise. It appears the triangles are breaking up with the notable exception of CNY. If / when CNY breaks as well, please don\'t forget that this is a *multi-year* formation and one that we\'re *all* watching very closely. It\'s okay to change your strategy when things change, but I saw a lot of people forget their own advice last October and they missed out on a big rally.

Because then all you have to do is do 0.11 mbit fees, and you are king of the hill because the other idiots didn't update and you jam the network with your transactions.

They might even begin to court that customer base.\n\nMerchants benefit more than consumers from the use of bitcoin as a currency (lower transactional fees and no chargebacks).  If the pie was big enough, they might offer a discount for purchasing with bitcoin (some do now).  The discount might be reason enough to see increased spending of btc by previous holders.  Also the transactional infrastructure would probably improve if there was increased demand from merchants and customers.  And there will be long term holders that would definitely prefer to spend the coin instead of converting directly to fiat for a variety of reasons (that is true now as well, but there just aren't enough to matter much).\n\nMy basic point was sort of chicken and egg.

Maybe they save a percentage or two (why would merchants even pass this on? If the benefit is reduced fees for them they\'re expected to immediately give away those extra profits) but the consumers lose reward points or cash back and the ability to charge back. There are so many cons for consumers that expecting this shift from merchants catering to customers to customers catering to merchants is more than wishful thinking - its illogical. Retail will never be a strong point for Bitcoin. \n\nThe "if Bitcoins were worth x and y percentage of people owned them" is nothing but fantasy. Indeed it is the chicken and the egg because the price won\'t rise without more consumer adoption but the consumer adoption will never come without strong incentives to abandon the methods they already use safely and conveniently.

This is different than a traditional double top in charting.  This break out is the most common type of price movement and it indicates that the price has broken through a resistance and it should move up.\n\nThere are two ways to predict an upward break out.  The first is to count the width of the formation.  In this case the formation is 11 columns wide.  If you add 11 boxes to the break out, the predicted high in the next 30 to 60 days is $485.  \n\nThe second predictive tool is to look at the last breakout.  This happened towards the end of March and the price topped out one box higher than the previous column.  That predictor is putting the 30 day price target at a whopping $435.  And that is not very exciting.\n\nAs this formation has been moving up since the middle of March, it makes sense to estimate that the breakout should have some legs.  I am thinking we move up to $450 and then struggle for a bit until we near the $485.\n\nThis is NOT going to happen overnight.  At least it is not supposed to.  The predictions are for the next 30 days and beyond.\n\nI am thrilled that we are over the $430 hump.  Lets see what the weekend brings for us.\n\nJust starting my garden.

I am reading much dumber shit than that all the time.  ': 2, 'I agree with your triangle, at least as a legitimate possible resistance line.  If you cut the big wick and go flatter you can draw one we haven\'t broken on some of the exchanges.  We are just under it (I show it at 2792 on Huobi right now).  I can\'t see any redrawing if it is broken.  Lots of legitimate lines have already been broken, but it\'s not acting like a confirmed breakout yet (not acting like a rejected one either though).\n\nThat said, I think sometimes people overly rely on TA here in their analysis.  I love TA, and bitcoin seems to really follow some of it more than almost anything I have ever seen.  But it is important to try to think about the reasons behind the TA.  \n\nThe slow creep up is better for a break out upward than a steep approach.  You can see that historically and it also makes sense if you understand the reason the lines are there in the first place.  A rapid approach to a line and then sharp rejection is a strong reversal pattern.  Easing across line after line without a sharp rejection is pretty strong.  Obviously exploding through a line with heavy volume and moving quickly away from it is super strong, but parabolic moves don\'t last long and are tricky to trade.  Also, you can break these lines and snap back in, so it\'s not really a "confirmed breakout" until its been on the other side for some time with some volume.  By then you have missed a lot of opportunity.  \n\nOf course many feel that is a safe entry, but you often have a retest of the breakout point, so maybe wait on that and enter when the former resistance becomes support.  That is probably one of the safest entries if you get the chance.  Problem is, you may not have that retest and you end up deciding whether or not to chase.\n\nSame idea while still in the triangle.  If you believe it will eventually break up, ideally you would love to enter near the lower support.  But then do you sell at resistance hoping for another test of support?  What if that doesn\'t happen?  At some point it\'s just giving money away honestly for whales to try something that will clearly fail.\n\nSo, there aren\'t really very many risk free spots.  Keep in mind that it doesn\'t have to be all or none though.  Add in good spots.  Take profit by selling some of your position at potential reversal points.  Use staggered stop loss orders to protect profit and to protect working capital.\n\nLastly, please remember that a whole lot of what you read here or in trollboxes is to convince people to buy or sell for the benefit of the poster, and not always for the reasons you may think (imagine if you were trying to accumulate a massive position... you need people to take the other side).

They are just invoicing off shore yuan to the on shore yuan and then taking the money and moving it off shore. You can currently only move something like 50k a year in outflows. Look at a chart of Bitcoin in August 2015 an the first quarter of this year. You will see a nice tick up whenever fears start popping up on the Chinese devaluation and hang sang crash. It's really not a question of if the PBOC devals it's a question of when. There is no world where they can continue to grow at 7%GDP with the amount of debt in that economy.  The real estate market is in the midst of a huge bubble and 60% of Chinese wealth is invested in that asset. We will see a huge wipe out in Chinese wealth when that market ticks down. The middle class is going to get killed. The PBOC can continue to ease but eventually they have to act when this cycle turns and they have to devalue the yuan, they have to recapitalize there banking system.

Bitfury, doesn't count, they're miners. \n\nSo basically your point is, if you take away the most well-funded successful businesses, also get rid of the most lucrative sectors of bitcoin, not a lot of companies are profitable.

Everyone needs to learn what trading style and level of stress they\'re okay with (or even, which style maximizes their profit and well being). I didn\'t do well when I traded daily or short swings. I always seemed to get shaken out or liquidated (when I tried futures) or frustrated, and I lost quite a bit of BTC when I started out a few years back. Given that experience, but given that I\'m still generally quite bullish on Bitcoin, the longer-term, large-position trades are what I *think* are going to be best for me in the long run. I\'ve also learned that I trade worse when I\'m short because I get conflicted emotions (I also "hold", so I found it harder to be short-term bearish when I was long-term bullish and because of that I\'d usually close my shorts for less profit than I could / should have, meaning on a risk-adjusted basis I did worse short than long). \n\nWhat I *do* need to learn is patience. I was out of a position and had a buy order (for  ~200BTC) at 390.50 (where support was) a day before I got impatient and took out nearly a full position at 422. Of course, the next day we hit 388 and I just held and grimaced, knowing I could have got a good chunk of my current position at a really great entry. \n\nHowever, something I\'ve also learned is that there\'s *really* no such thing as a *perfect* entry or exit. There\'s *good* and that\'s it. 420 might not sound very "good" compared to 390, but as I said I\'m bullish, so if the price hits the next resistance at 680, *that\'s* when 420 becomes the "good enough" entry. I used to spend a lot in fees and stress trying to get in and out and always get that sweet ass feeling of buying the bottom or selling the top, and I\'d just be chasing and wrecking myself along the way. As much as holding this position and it\'s corresponding $300k loan on BFX for 40 days really sucks, I\'m patient enough to see it through to the light at the end of the tunnel. Or at least, that\'s the plan...': 8, "The way the network *should* deal with volume surges is by prioritizing economically significant transactions (like moving thousands of dollars to an exchange) over comparatively insignificant transactions, due to the fact that economically significant transactions are more likely to be willing to pay a higher absolute fee.  That hasn't worked very well so far because running up against the blocksize limit is a relatively new phenomenon, and thus the ecosystem isn't very well adapted to it - people use wallets that have either fixed or poorly estimated fees, and RBF is still a nascent feature without meaningful adoption.\n\nPart of the argument for not rushing a block size increase is that we can deal with these problems now rather than putting it off until a later point when the ramifications may be even more severe.  I'm of the belief that the eventual optimal usage of the network is a state of full blocks, regardless of what the blocksize limit ends up being, thus I see merit in the idea that we should learn to cope with it now and *then* increase blocksize, rather than putting off the need to deal with these disfunctions until later on.  \n\nI take it you think the network should *not* be run at capacity, regardless of what that capacity is?  In other words, whatever demand for space in blocks is, blocksize limits should be greater than that?  Because to me that implies you're ignoring the fact that blocksize is a security/decentralization parameter in addition to a scaling parameter.  I'm of the opinion that the blocksize *limit* should be set on security/decentralization conditions, and capacity will most likely max out at whatever that limit is.  That requires dealing optimally with capacity limits, which is a process that's maturing as we speak due almost entirely to the fact that we're having to deal with those limits, and imo better now than later.": 3, "That's next week": 2, "BFX at 428.

It gives you quite a range where you can stay for the next couple of months.  \n\nBut you won\'t get killed too much by the price shooting up.\n\nI guess before I did any of those things I would consider what the "black swam" premium is.  I\'ve done this on the vix.  You pick a number that is way, way out of the money.  You buy a couple of calls months out.  Every couple of weeks you roll it out another month.  Every few months "something" happens that will drive the Vix up near your target.  It is "going to happen."  You just have to be pre-set for it.

When there is none I kinda have to throw my ideals over board.': 1, "Liquidity is good if you're trading ALT/BTC pairings, but be warned, site stability during times of volatility is not great.\n\nRe: their API is pretty simple & comprehensive for most things, but you can accomplish all the same things w/ Bitfinex via Websockets -- maybe a little bit more code, but not complex.": 4, 'Thanks. that was the type of info I was looking for': 1, "I've used them pretty much exclusively.
