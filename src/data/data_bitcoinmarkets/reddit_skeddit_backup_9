There was no thinking things through. **Everything is ad-hoc!** Therefore it kinda works except when it doesn\'t!\n\nLike with over-leveraging, which they thought they had fixed by applying an ad-hoc patch.

We didn\'t notice the error until yesterday, until we had mined millions of altcoins worth thousands of dollars.  We are the sole miner for many of these coins.\n\nWe submitted a ticket and their COO, Bit John, was assigned to service it.  They fixed their problem sometime during the middle of the night.  We have a "balancer" script that runs every few minutes.  It sells coins we mined that no customers want, and buys coins we didn\'t mine but customers want.\n\nIn this case, the balancer hadn\'t been able to contact Cryptsy for many days.  It conducted almost all its buys and some of its sells at Poloniex in the interim, but there are many coins only available at Cryptsy that could not be sold at Poloniex.  When Cryptsy fixed its API issues, the balancer detected the fix and initiated its recovery procedure.  In this case, we sold about 100,000 blocks of Cryptsy-only coins in under 60s.  We mine more than 50 coins that are only offered at Cryptsy, and they were all converted to BTC, or to LTC and then the LTC sold to BTC, within 60s.\n\nTo those who had no knowledge of what had happened, this situation would likely resemble a market panic.

Thanks for engaging and for taking the time to reply. :)\n\n>The one claim that has followed Bitfinex around for quite some time now is people claiming that Bitfinex is just ripped off code from the Bitcoinica code leak.

Unlike Bitcoinica, Bitcoin was of fundamentally sound design.\n\n>When Raphael created Bitfinex in 2012 he did use some of the front end code from Bitcoinica for Bitfinex but, and this is a big but, none of the code in our backend was ever the same as Bitcoinica.\n\nThis is wrong. Who told you this? That person lied to you. It is contradicted by the Bitfinex founder\'s announcement thread. Specifically his exchange with davout, in this thread: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=119745.0\n\nPerhaps what you meant to say was that the back end was based on Bitcoinica, but the front end was not?\n\n>Furthermore, at this point a grand total of 0 lines from Bitcoinica\'s code exist on Bitfinex.\n\nThis could plausibly be technically true, but it\'s still of a misrepresentation. The business logic is zhoutong\'s old mess, unless you actually designed a new system from scratch that managed to faithfully emulate the bad parts of Bitcoinica. In which case, the people responsible should... get a medal or something. \n\nIt still leaves the question of how you managed to reproduce bugs from Bitcoinica. ;)\n\nSeriously though.

The above services generate a new credit card number for each purchase. How anonymous are you really when you have to put in an address to ship something anyway? Also, in the case of internet payments, you actually WANT to be able to charge back when the merchant ships you a brick in a box instead of a laptop.

Most of the individuals signing up for Gemini already buy & sell BTC, so the demand already exists, it's just shifting markets.

Still tenable given the low complexity of the site.\n* There's some bundle bloat. They're including React along with jQuery and jQuery UI, inlined fonts, Highcharts, custom SVG and more. Some optimizations could be done here but at least it's being cached well. Production optimizations don't appear to be turned on for React.\n* Debug calls are making it into the bundle - Gemini devs, if you're reading this, see [strip-loader](https://github.com/yahoo/strip-loader).\n* Some stringified Sass code and comments made it into the bundle.

Other moderators in the sub tend not to use it as much as I do.  But normally if I\'m handing out a ban, I\'ll start off with a 1 day ban and explain why the user has received the ban.  In that sense, I use the ban hammer as a bit of a "time out" when things are getting too heated.\n\nWith that said, though, I don\'t ban anyone simply because the community has deemed them a "troll".  First, I think we\'d be better off if we banned the term "troll" altogether.  That term is thrown around incorrectly so much.  At this point, a /r/bitcoinmarkets "troll" is basically anyone who says negative things about bitcoin or the bitcoin community.  Well, that\'s not really an /r/bitcoinmarkets troll.  That might be an /r/bitcoin troll, but it\'s not an /r/bitcoinmarkets troll.  People are free to speak as negatively as they want about bitcoin in /r/bitcoinmarkets.  The problem is when the bullish people react to those overly negative comments and turn it into a battle between "good" (the pro-bitcoin crowd) and "evil" (buttcoiners).  There is no good or evil side in /r/bitcoinmarkets.  There is only greed and money.\n\nBut ultimately, the problem goes further than that.  This will be an uncomfortable thing for some to read, and I\'m sure many here will give me a lot of shit for it as well.  The problem is that a lot of the points and observations that the buttcoiners put forth are correct and valid, and the pro-bitcoiners don\'t have a great response for that.  People are egotistical.  They don\'t like to lose an argument on the internet, so they latch onto anything they can to try and win the debate, and they get too emotionally invested because their own money is at stake and someone is challenging them for their belief in bitcoin.  I\'m not saying that everything that comes out of a "troll" or "buttcoiner\'s" mouth is absolutely correct or appropriate (because a lot of the time it\'s not), but there are SO MANY TIMES when a user shows up and says something valid and correct but negative towards bitcoin, and the community rains downvotes on them and calls them a troll or a buttcoiner.  Just because someone said something that you disagree with or don\'t like, that doesn\'t make them a troll or a buttcoiner.  Instead of immediately casting that person as an enemy, a person should look to better understand WHY the user believes the things they are saying.  It is in the understanding of why another person holds a specific viewpoint that we come to better understand both their view and our own.\n\nI got off track there for a moment, but ultimately, a TL:DR response is:  We don\'t ban people for having negative opinions about bitcoin.  Those people are actually quite welcome, in fact.  We ban people for breaking the rules of the sub, which are clearly laid out in the wiki and mostly in the sidebar as well.': 19, 'Yes If you read through my posts I do not think I have a positive bias although I do get happy when the price rises.': 1, "Ignoring them doesn't make them go away.

In fact, I think the next block reward halving could actually cause difficulty to decline as some miners are forced to step back because it's no longer economical for them to mine at a block reward of 12.5 BTC.  (not permanently decline, but I do believe there may be a shakeout in the mining community.)\n\nThink of it another way.  Say you and I both run businesses producing widgets, and we are competitors, and there are hundreds or thousands of other competitors running the same type of widget business.  However, there's only 1 buyer for everyone's widgets, and they purchase on a first come first serve basis.  They pay $1 million for every widget delivery they receive from a supplier.  All the widget companies are operating on the assumption that they will receive $1M for every order, and so they operate their businesses in a way that they receive comfortable profit margins for their business.  But then the buyer announces that in 6 months they will no longer pay $1M per shipment.  The new rate will be $500K per shipment.\n\nA lot of those supplier's margins will become non-existent when their revenue becomes cut in half (and transaction fees are nowhere near the level of block rewards).  Many suppliers will have to get much leaner and more efficient to survive.  \n\nI think we could see something like that happen within the mining community.

First, the survey shows that a plurality of people obtain their bitcoin news mainly from reddit, which means that /u/theymos\'s censorship is very significant.  Second, a majority of people agree or strongly agree that bitcoin\'s price has fallen as a result of the blocksize debate.  Third, people largely agree with most of the new features in bitcoin XT.  Fourth, contrary to what miners have led everyone to believe, half of people agree that BIP 101 or bitcoin XT is the solution to the problem, while all other solutions combined are supported by fewer people.\n\nBut the most important finding in this survey is the timeframe on which the blocksize should be resolved.  Some people stated it should always be fixed 6 months out or 5 years out, but the vast majority of respondents believe that a permanent fix should be implemented for the indefinite future.\n\nI think there are two issues that have become very clear from this survey.  First, depending on how many people you assign from the general "forums" category to bitcointalk.org, it\'s possible that a majority of people obtain bitcoin news from sites controlled by /u/theymos.  People who brush this off as not a big deal are ignoring clear evidence to the contrary.\n\nSecond, miners are not acting in the interest of bitcoin as a whole.  Even though miners were included in this survey, half of respondents still supported the BIP 101 proposal.  I\'d be interested in their releasing the numbers for that question when miners are eliminated from the sample.  \n\nLooking at history, in all the altcoins where this has happened, exchanges lock wallets until the two sides come to an agreement.

They don't care about the news because they make the news. The price -the structure of the price- is not a reaction to the news.\n\nAll we mortals know for sure is the chart. The chart tells us that 220 is the bottom: 'they' simply don't let it drop below 220 for more than a day. Hence there is way more up in this chart than there is down, hence it is a rationally sound decision in terms of risk-reward to buy at these prices, with stops below 220 (for example). Hence, since demand has been given confidence to buy, it overcomes supply. That is why the price rises, not 'gemini'.\n\nI think this is the very early phase of a big rally, possibly the one that takes out of the 200s for good. I don't think it will be without volatility and crazy ups and downs before all manner of bears (and moonkids) get shaken out, but in the end up will prevail.\n\nThe best advertisement of Bitcoin is the price (or, rather, the rise in price). Let's be honest: the main feature of Bitcoin is not 'privacy' or 'decentralisation', it is that the price (in theory) goes up and makes you wealthier. And I say this while considering myself an anarchist, but to be honest who would buy Bitcoin, or anything, to lose wealth? Anyways, when (if) Bitcoin's price returns to rising more than falling, non-trader and non-techie people will get interested again, and then the price will really rise to the moon.\n\nSo, given that the accumulators are saying goodbye to their 220 startegic zone, that halvings and etfs are running towards us, I think now (last week, actually) is the time to buy.\n\nI'm all-in long on the quarterlies, 20x, since 235.

I like to think of the first lesson of economics as it explains the theory behind bitcoin's value very simply:\n\nPrice is a function of Supply and Demand: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_and_demand\n\nIt is a fundamental law of economics. Assuming over time coins can become lost/dead as you put it, that means that the supply will drop. Assuming that demand stays constant, price will increase.\n\nTo answer your second question, the amount actively traded reflecting itself in the price. I would say, do not assume the value of 1 BTC when actively traded is going to be any different to the value of 1 BTC say on my laptop's wallet that has just been sitting there for years. This is something called Fungibility: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungibility\n\nIn layman terms, fungibility means that 1 BTC will always equal 1 BTC. Knowing this, and knowing bitcoin's supply curve as a constant, the network's value shouldn't be affected by the number of coins actively in supply.\n\nIn your examples (online gambling / ETF listing), if that does happen, yes I would expect the price to increase, but that is not down to fungibility, it is due to the fact that the *utilitarian value* of the currency is increasing. Naturally when more useful use-cases come up, more people will justify buying bitcoin and when that happens, refer back to the rule above (increase in demand, and constant supply will equate to a higher price).\n\nDisclosure: I'm pro-bitcoin and long.": 1, "The price is determined by whatever people are willing to pay.\n\nEveryone with bitcoins that is willing to sell, tells the exchange what price they are willing to sell at.

Why? Go look at a gold chart, or moreover look at the silver chart. The silver chart looks almost indistinguishable from the Bitcoin chart. Those lose money out the ass on a yearly basis, yet plenty of people have serious money in them. Ridiculously volatile. Still popular. Did you know that the paper silver market is worth $5 Trillion, by the way? The physical market alone is $20 Billion. Paper Bitcoin, if it eventually trades as an ETF will fucking nuke the Bitcoin price. Absolutely nuke it sky high. And trust me, I don\'t know when this will happen, but it will happen. Even as it stands your idea of seeing $25 a Bitcoin is mindblowingly absurd given the lower speculative price at that time was due to the difficulty of actually purchasing them.\n\nBitcoin has accrued value through increased accessibility and stability since the price was that low. It has accrued trust, however untrustworthy. That raises the price naturally. I\'d put in a $100 bottom at the very least.\n\nAt this stage, I am predicting no dramatic decrease in Bitcoin prices. Perhaps a despair phase could set in, but I think it\'s irrelevant in the long term. If the system continues to be reasonable stable, and this fork business does not see any apocalyptic turmoil, I\'m totally optimistic on the long term price of Bitcoin.

Go down to Venezuela where mining is essentially free. Purportedly a single operator can push 10 or 100TH for $1 per month or something ridiculous, don't quote me on the exact numbers here. Point being that there are similar persons in the United States and elsewhere that can purchase an S5, S7 AntMiner (or several) who have free electric built into their apartment or business lease agreements. These persons can and will mine Bitcoin regardless of the price because it costs little to nothing. Once the miner is paid off, they are money printers.\n\nYes, some commercial miners will scale down with price. But I would guess many hobbyists and entities with free electricity would happily move along even if Bitcoin was $1. Remember, living standards elsewhere around the world vary greatly. $10 in the US may buy lunch, while $10 elsewhere may pay rent for a month. With free electricity there are many persons who can mine Bitcoin profitably at very low prices; e.g., $50 and below.\n\nPersonally my target repurchase range is $25-75. However we may go lower if whales decide to liquidate their entire stock of Bitcoins. Many whales have to weigh the benefit of selling at $50 or sitting on their piles of Bitcoin for a very long time, perhaps even a decade or more (or never), before they are valuable. I am not a whale, so I cannot tell you how I would personally act with 100,000 coins. But all the statements above about wealth storage remain true.\n\nHowever, any whale that believed in Bitcoin would still probably be better off selling their inactive stock and investing in startups, stock markets, or any other wealth vehicle that is more liquid. There is no point in owning beyond 10,000 BTC currently since it can be difficult to sell without chasing price. It would make much more sense for whales to be diversified. Once Bitcoin gets to the sub-$100's whales may finally give up and consistently crash price for a while, but it likely depends on their strategy. Again, I have no idea. I am not other persons, cannot speak for their investment portfolios. All I know is any whale sitting on 15,000 BTC is basically illiquid. Rich in theory and on paper, but when put into practice, they can only draw so much before they hurt the market.

They have very clearly spelled out deflation, and a slowing money velocity. Most long-term holders and speculators will not only panic with a sustained sub-$200 price point, but also sell in order to pay rent and traditional bills. If you take a look over at /r/Bitcoin, one will notice that many are young speculators wishing to be in the "21 Club" where they buy and hold 21.0 BTC to (hypothetically) be one-in-a-million fractional owners.\n\nOn the opposite end, many here in /r/BitcoinMarkets are a bit more savvy, but also weary of holding a speculative asset and want a half-way decent price rise so they can exit. Read the troll-box on BTC-e and you will find the same mentality. Yes, there are some long-term holders. However, there is very strong "Holder Fatigue" and many are waiting for price to pop so they can sell and stop checking the price.\n\nThis is why the whales are most likely holding price in a $233-$235 range for a short while. Either there is about to be a breakout pump or runaway price. Or, these guys want to unload bite-sized amounts at a reasonably higher price, and then allow the market to cycle back up to the $230-240\'s again before selling more. The whales are most likely trying to unload as much as they can, because they understand how price is made on the Exchanges. They likely anticipate a collapse, understand holder-fatigue and know how far they can play the game.\n\nAs economic conditions worsen, $50-100 seems perfectly reasonable, but to be fair $500+ seems reasonable too. Most here are speculating that the scarcity of Bitcoin will eventually kick in; becoming the driving force (and it may, eventually.) However, scarcity will not likely be a driving price factor until 2020+ when user adoption is beyond the first-wave adopters and a few more useful applications for it are found. But most especially, Bitcoin has to first be proven as a viable method for wealth storage much like gold, silver and commodities.\n\nMany, if not all, fanciful Blockchain concepts like the Internet of Things, Augur, Colored Coins, etc. will work just as well at 1.00000000 BTC -> $1.00 USD or even less. The price does not become important until Bitcoin has been validated as a true store of wealth; and, currently it is not validated as such. This excepts a few select countries with hyper-inflation, many whom use BTC to transfer into USD or EUR. For all intents and purposes, Bitcoin price will likely be irrelevant to the apps that use it, and the price will not become a major factor until it\'s proven and validated as a reliable wealth storage mechanism. The value of Bitcoin is limited to the amount of capital placed on it during Escrow, so the value may go up according to that, but it is still not a proper wealth store.\n\nTo drive home the point, Bitcoin has not even been through a single major economic downturn. Nobody knows how it will perform in a recession or deflation, even if it is the pseudo digital-equivalent of gold and silver. It has not proven itself empirically. So until then, Bitcoin is an expensive lottery ticket. Until you can put $500 USD of wealth on the Blockchain and get $500 USD out **without worrying** about losing more than 3% of its value over a year-long period, for several years, it remains an unproven mechanism for wealth storage. It should not be treated as a generic savings vehicle until then and should be considered a speculative asset at best. More realistically, a lottery ticket.\n\nThe reason Venture Capitalists can justify backing mining companies is because they usually have a 3-year exit strategy on their investments and pass the liability onto a bigger idiot in the future; i.e., Series A, B, C, D and then IPO. So long as everybody believes that in 2020+ Bitcoin will be worth $10,000+ USD, the game can continue since there are few investment opportunities aside from Space, Medicine, FinTech, Material Sciences, etc. Big money can very easily outlast most 20-30 somethings with a few dozen Bitcoins that also have monthly rent, bills and life events that come up from time to time, month to month, for years. It\'s likely that Bitcoin will take at least 5 or 10-years to validate as a proper wealth storage mechanism, and it could realistically fail before then. Also, any significant price rise will likely be met with a lot of holders willing to cash out (and more holder-fatigue for those that don\'t.)\n\nIN ANY CASE, the last $315 -> $170 (or thereabouts) massive sell-off a few weeks back was quite the ride and pretty much says it all. The floor can drop at any moment, in a matter of minutes if anyone with enough (5,000+) coins decides to crash the market. That figure comes from BitFinex when they mentioned it would take about 5,000 BTC to move the price 10%. A savvy person may multiply that by 2-3x to get the true number, or we could consider that an over-estimation of confidence and the number may be much less. Any trader that buys and sells on an Exchange should or would notice that bots are EXTREMELY sensitive to price movements. Bots are aware of the arbitrage opportunities and will shrink their bid / ask volumes accordingly so they remain competitive but do not get picked-off to arbitrage on other exchanges. In many ways, Bitcoin trading bots are easy to trick and exploit.\n\nIn reality, the amount of coins needed to move the price $1 is probably a lot less than 100 BTC if done in the correct buying pattern that reinforces bot trading algorithms in an up or down trend. This is why the idea of whales teaming up together to hold price between $233-235 to drop 2,000 coins is not necessarily a doomsday, but definitely a manipulation of the market to gain a better vantage. Clearly we can see that BitFinex has some hidden walls and is experiencing a lot of sideways movement. So if a group of whales truly are coordinating to hold price between $233-235 in a slow sell-off, then we can expect to see a 5% drop in price, most likely, unless some new bag holders come along. This will most likely happen once other bots and traders eventually figure out that the money is not coming back into the system. Trading bots are not very sophisticated yet, they seem to have predictable behaviors and can be gamed pretty easily. However, it is uncertain that this whale information is correct; I have no idea. \n\nThe point of whales moving 2,000 coins slowly is not necessarily to crash the market, but to cash out at the highest estimated returns given their holdings. As stated before, they could be holding tens or hundreds of thousands of coins, and also made rich with fiat by the $400+ days of hysteria buying. So, loaded with Fiat, that can put up large price walls that confuse and validate trading bot behaviors and therefore continue to manipulate the price and sell at a profit. It\'s psychological warfare between traders. And the point of whales coordinating together isn\'t about how much or little they are moving; the point is simply that they may be working together. Their holding is irrelevant.\n\nHow Bitcoin will perform in a slowing economy is up for debate. While the tech most certainly has long-term value, it is not validated as a long-term store of wealth. If or when it does become validated as a wealth store, the debate will not be about how many fractions of ownership or percentage of the 21M pie you own, but simply that you can reliably put in $500 USD of wealth savings in and get $500+ USD out over a long time period. Too many holders / buyers are playing the fraction and percentage of ownership game. They are over-investing by a landslide. Sorry.\n\nThe big question is, how will Bitcoin perform throughout this upcoming economic slowdown, recession or complete collapse? While Bitcoin is innovative, paper at least has the intrinsic value of being used as toiletries, writing slabs, fuel, origami figurines and whatever else. Bitcoin is worthless without (1) electricity, (2) a computer and (3) internet access. That is quite different than gold, silver, paper and all other physical and tangible things, regardless of Bitcoin\'s other unique and special properties.\n\nAnyways, this is not financial advice.

Another source has also informed me that it is likely this group of whales made significant gains during the $400+ days. I am unsure if they are setting up for a pump, or dump so make of it what you will. In the interest of remaining unbiased, I am shorting approximately 300 coins currently. So this may be biased. Unfortunately there is no way to verify the above information so you will have to price it accordingly.\n\nHowever, the BitFinex flat-lined price seems to indicate manipulation. The order books seem to indicate a price gap of $233 and $235 with very thin volume between. I have a haunch they may be inviting many to sell with the hidden price wall, in anticipation of a pump. However, they would then simply unload their coins during said pump.\n\nBest of luck."\n\nTL; DR Price may go down or go up and then down.

Look at the recent survey Changetip just did.  70 something % of millennials said they would never use Changetip..........because it was a bitcoin company.

See why so many people like daytrading it...? If you have the time and are a good guesser then you may be able to profit more than 1% daily. I like to assume large moves can come at any time so I move in and out dozens of times per day to hedge against large downward moves (which seem common the last year).\n(3) The other 50% to be used for medium-term strategies.

However, this month this sub will only post roughly 43,000 unique visitors, roughly a 30% loss from months prior.  I think there are two major causes for this: 1.) people are bored with the price which pretty much does nothing day in and day out.  I also think that 2.) /u/theymos has pissed enough bitcoiners off that they are exiting the ecosystem altogether and thus this sub.\n\n/r/bitcoin also posted 2 year traffic lows at ~435,000 compared to 500-600 thousand, a cool 25% loss.  However, this one I can 100% for certain claim /u/theymos is fully responsible for.  I've been tracking the traffic stats of both subs closely and the days following the censorship drama /r/bitcoins traffic dropped substantially with a very obvious correlation to all of the drama.  What's unclear is if these people exited bitcoin completely or just that subreddit.  My instincts tell me that both things happened.  Something else to note is that smaller communities popped up over at /r/bitcoinxt and /r/bitcoin_uncensored\n\nAlso interesting to note is that the weeks following the drama and subsequent loss of traffic to /r/bitcoin, the subscribers per day quadruled for a couple weeks and then subsided to normal levels.

[/r/bitcoinmarkets](https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoinmarkets) has been losing traffic because Bitcoin has been fairly stable over the last 8 months so there hasn\'t been ample opportunity to make money. Also, the quantity and quality of content in here as of late has been seriously lacking.

Even $230 has a lot of support on the buy side. So it seems like everything is coordinated for an imminent run-up. That being said, order books can be misleading. Reason I reference the BFX order book as an indicator is because BFX seemed to be the main driver of the flash crash last time. I have noticed order books on other exchanges will inevitably "mirror" BFX, whether this is coincidental I am not sure.
