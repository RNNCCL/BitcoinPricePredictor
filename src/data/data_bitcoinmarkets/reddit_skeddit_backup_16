Also are you trying to build a product for a user your think is there but really isn\'t ? I have been asking this question to more of the exchange CEOs that I chat with -- namely because I find many of them think that the retail trader from E-Trade is right around the corner to discovering bitcoin and wanting to trade it -- to be frank these guys have little to no interest in bitcoin when it is not a simple ticker already on their existing platform -- so if you accept that notion then you are stuck with the existing crypto trader base -- one that clearly has an appetite for leverage and advanced products over simple spot/low leverage. When I hear an exchange start up that has a tagline that "hey guys the biggest innovation we have is insured deposits" I not only cringe but I just have little interest in that mindset -- and I can already tell by your hinting at products that they are lackluster and won\'t generate any excitement -- simply put their is no wow factor and your exchange will likely die on the vine -- little to no reason for me to talking about an exchange for those reasons. The exchange space is certainly a start-up culture and really insuring deposits doesn\'t actually instill any faith in the market participants because we still have to trust the people running the exchange that they are telling the truth. This is the way the BTC market has evolved and that trust is **EARNED** not made through "we have insured deposits" -- I put way more faith in BFX because not only have they stood the test of time but I talk with Phil Potter(PGP) and Giancalro on WhaleClub TeamSpeak daily -- that trust can\'t be assumed with insured deposits so that is why I say they have little importance in the space -- better to built a great product and earn that trust IMO.

Can't be a coincidence, right?\n\nText from site:\n\nSocial networking has become ubiquitous throughout much of the world but introduce decentralization, and the traditional network becomes something unrecognizable.\n\nThe prosaic notion of an \xe2\x80\x98egalitarian\xe2\x80\x99 social network, where each user both controls and feels their power within it, on the surface fits well with the notion of decentralized technologies \xe2\x80\x93 the blockchain, decentralized ledger and cryptocurrency. Although the latter has only existed in the mainstream for six years or so, in 2015 decentralized networks are already making this notion a reality.\n\nSocial networks used throughout the world \xe2\x80\x93 notably Facebook \xe2\x80\x93 tend to use advertising as their major source of revenue. Advertising manipulates users and gathers information about their lifestyles, and is in turn tied to fiat currency, which allows the network to continue operating. The manipulation element is key: users sign up to the network, which then uses their habits to generate revenue, while keeping them on the network through targeted advertising and by giving them a freely customizable interface which lets them feel \xe2\x80\x98in control\xe2\x80\x99.\n\nThis mechanism of manipulation is one aspect of Facebook\xe2\x80\x99s operation, in particular, which has generated criticism. Other aspects are notably the selling of user data to third party companies \xe2\x80\x93 a security issue, some would say \xe2\x80\x93 and the associated infringements on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s privacy this involves.\n\nA social network built on principles of decentralization, where each user (or node) can manipulate the network to achieve a desired, purely social goal, at once appears to be a polar opposite of the advertising-based model.\n\nWhile such an undertaking, and making it popular, is no easy feat, the few projects now emerging have huge ambitions.\n\nToshiDesk, a user-centered \xe2\x80\x98social trading network\xe2\x80\x99 whose public beta is due to be released at the end of April, is incorporating its own cryptocurrency as a reward mechanism, placing value on the insights of its users. Rather than relying on prebuilt tools, users can ask successful traders for advice on altcoin trading, these traders then being rewarded if the advice given turns out to be useful. An open dialog platform allows for real-time communication between users, and it is hoped that the volatility of altcoin trading will ultimately become less of an obstacle for the network\xe2\x80\x99s user base.\n\nElsewhere, however, there is a project in which decentralized principles are seeing their full implementation: Synereo. Designed from the ground up specifically to allow the user\xe2\x80\x99s agency to take precedence over all other intentions, Synereo\xe2\x80\x99s social network features its own currency token, AMP, and offers users the ability to completely control the spread of information. The platform even comes in the form of a distributed server on each user\xe2\x80\x99s device, with no reliance on central information processing.\n\nCoinTelegraph previously interviewed CEO Dor Konforty about Synereo\xe2\x80\x99s ethos, in which he outlined the basic principles of the project. While ambitious, the idea that the dominance of players such as Facebook could be disrupted may nonetheless seem hard to believe. Several months closer to the planned launch date, however, both Konforty and co-founder Anderson McCutcheon remain under no illusion about the penetration needed to bring mainstream users over to the decentralized model.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cFor mainstream adoption, our long term goal is to provide a superior user experience,\xe2\x80\x9d McCutcheon says. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can implement features that are not \xe2\x80\x98accessible\xe2\x80\x99 to Facebook and other networks due to monetization constraints.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSuch features include what is arguably Synereo\xe2\x80\x99s game-changing innovation for fans of decentralized technologies, its \xe2\x80\x98Attention Economy.\xe2\x80\x99 This model is what governs the flow of information through the Synereo network, based on learned user preferences and activity. The model also makes use of reputation, which, according to Synereo is an integral part of the new online economy. On top of this model, Synereo allows users to both pay for increased propagation of their posts with Synereo\xe2\x80\x99s internal currency asset, the AMP, and for users viewing that \xe2\x80\x9cAMPed\xe2\x80\x9d content in their feeds to be compensated with a portion of the AMPs invested.\n\nMcCutcheon gave CoinTelegraph additional insight into the Synereo model, highlighting the team\xe2\x80\x99s position on what can be achieved and its longer term strategy to provide social network users with a new experience\n\n*CoinTelegraph:* Synereo is a pioneering example of a decentralized social network. While the advantages for users \xe2\x80\x93 as well as the general 'healthier' ethos \xe2\x80\x93 are clear, how do you intend to spread the word and get people genuinely excited about this new model? Do you think the Facebook model is too entrenched to be shifted?\n\n*Anderson McCutcheon:* A carpenter should be no more interested in the inner-workings of a social media platform than I am interested in the complicated multi-national supply chain and manufacturing process that made the chair I sit on happen.\n\nI don't believe that the mainstream user believes there is anything wrong with the model, nor should the user care about it. We hope our vision of decentralized communications and content delivery will resonate with early adopters, but it will not be enough to carry us to the mainstream.\n\nFor mainstream adoption, our long term goal is to provide a superior user experience - we can implement features that are not 'accessible' to Facebook and other networks due to monetization constraints.\n\nA public company can never implement a feature, no matter how beneficial it is, if it comes with a 5 % revenue hit. A product developed on top of Synereo is not bound by anything but the benefit of its users. Nothing but the user matters.\n\n*CT:* AMPs are designed not to be dependent upon fiat currency in any way. How do you plan to communicate their value to Synereo users? What will they be able to do with AMP wealth that will motivate them to use them?\n\n*AM:* AMPs enable the attention economy - anyone who uses Synereo will have AMPs. Their value is derived from the exact same model that powers today\xe2\x80\x99s free-to-use Internet, attention.\n\nWe don't believe AMPs should be a major part of the normal user's daily experience or a selling point for Synereo. Compensation is part of the \xe2\x80\x98nature\xe2\x80\x99 of the attention economy, but we will never try to position Synereo as the network you use or join to get paid. The greatest benefit will be for content creators who will be able to distribute content over a platform devoid of middlemen, where all the users have currency that can be spent on purchasing and amplifying content.\n\nWe also believe that Synereo represents the absolute easiest way to onramp people onto the cryptocurrency world. All one has to do is participate in the network as is the norm on other social networks to receive the value that is normally kept by the centralized service provider - in AMPs, our cryptocoin.\n\n*CT:* What kinds of changes and upgrades do you foresee being necessary should considerable numbers of users adopt Synereo? What kind of numbers is the current implementation designed to handle?\n\n*AM:* Synereo already has a powerful, working P2P stack. It's the result of four years of development and 3.2M USD in funding. However, when it comes to user acquisition and retention, UX is everything, and our initial goal is focusing on very specific implementations on top of the tech stack. We are currently in the process of prioritizing these implementations before we begin working on mainstream-grade UI.\n\nPerhaps what is often overlooked, features aside, is the significance a project like Synereo holds for the cryptocurrency community. While much effort is being placed into shaking off the \xe2\x80\x98nerd\xe2\x80\x99 persona of the industry, the emergence specifically of a social network is an essential step in showing the flexibility and openness of decentralized instruments.\n\nJust as Google opened up the internet of information in the late 1990s, so perhaps can social structures fostering the user\xe2\x80\x99s agency replace the first-generation, money-driven models. For the one billion plus users of social networks, the new generation of the social network could ultimately make decentralization alluring, on-trend and even something that is taken for granted.": 4}, ('Interesting Paper on "Why Do Markets Crash?

If the price increases to $105, buying back those 10 BTC will cost $1050, which is the initial return of $1000 plus half your collateral. If the price increases to $108, you will only have $20 left after closing the position (since the remaining $80 of your collateral is used to cover the losses of the trade). If the price goes up to $111, the exchange is $10 short to close everything up for you as it needs $1110 to buy back the borrowed coins, but only has $1000 + $100 available.\n\nDifferent exchanges have different levels at which they will warn their users that a trade is going sour. In this example, the exchange may issue a margin call at $107, when paper losses have gone up to 70% of the collateral. The trader can then decide between depositing more money to increase the size of the collateral, closing the trade and taking the loss or do nothing and hope for the price to go down again. Then when the price hits $109, the exchange will automatically buy back the borrowed 10 BTC and close the trade. At this point the user has no say in the matter and he will be left with whatever remains, which is typically only a fraction of his investment.\n\nIf for some reason, the exchange can\'t close the trade before the price crosses the threshold of $110, the account of the trader will go into the negative values. It depends on the exchange how this is handled. Some exchanges take on this risk themselves and have reserves to deal with this. Others may force the trader to deposit money to bring his account back to zero (this doesn\'t really happen with Bitcoin exchanges, since exchanges don\'t have the means to force traders to comply). Or the exchange may take part of the profits from other trades to cover the loss ("socialized losses").\n\nedit: After posting, I realized that OKCoin deals with futures contracts rather than going short or long actual BTC. This means that when going short, instead of borrowing BTC to sell and rebuy at a later time, the trader enters into a contract to sell BTC at some later time at a predetermined price. The rest of the post still applies, as the trader need only to keep part of the value of the contract in his account as collateral, and if the price moves against the trader, he will not have enough money to buy the required amount of BTC to fulfill the contract, which means measures such as margin calls or forced liquidations are put in place.': 10, 'Someone needs to add Le Mogwai to those names.... \n\nI love the profile you chose for rekt though :D': 1, 'When you say this: \n\n>Or the exchange may take part of the profits from other trades to cover the loss ("socialized losses").\n\nDoes that just mean extra cash (or new cash from forced sales of other assets) in the trader\'s account with the exchange?\n': 1, "so sorry for such loses. can't see people falling ": 1, 'Trading an amount of capital that the vast majority of Americans will never see in their lifetimes on 20x margin is the definition of greed.

It was also a good indication that there is still healthy buying pressure in the markets.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s possible that the perfect storm is brewing for Bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s next boost in user adoption.

But i have been saying since Nov that his count was off.  He had this bear trend defined as single corrective wave;  his revised count uses a much larger in scale.\n\nNow we both agree that we are finishing the first impulse of a larger correction, with Wave 5 still to finish (meaning B and C are also still to come).  The best question to ask at this point is whether 4 has finished or not; i think not, but most would call that wildly optimistic.  We are (most likely) entering Wave 2 of 5, so A.5.ii, which results in the tl;dr target.  If we are (fingers crossed) at A.4.a.iv than still have some sideways or even down, with a proabale target of 2117 by May 5 for A.4.a.v.\n\nEither way, we both see a 5th wave as imminent, meaning a BIG downward push this summer.  I feel that the pattern of extended '3's upon which we both agree includes a 'counter balance' of overthrown '2's or '4's which should create some great trading ahead, culminating in the ultimate fakeout of wave 5 not pushing deeper than wave 3 (so triple bottom at 1000 this summer), but once again, this would be considered a very optimistic way to read the count.  DanV's prediction of a lower low ($80 or whatever) this summer has a much higher confidence interval.\n\nDanV has a much better track record than I do, so take what i say with a grain of salt.  I just wanted to have this one moment where i had a valid point.  It has probably passed.\n\nBut I still see bitcoin as a different animal, one that takes on every shot a full retrace with wild abandon.

At 4:05 EST we had a flash dump down to $236.5 and quickly recovered back into the $240\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\nOne strategy you can use, is to set a buy order at $1 above these bottom levels to make instant profit from the retracement. It\xe2\x80\x99s generally a good idea to set your orders slightly above support and below resistance to ensure they get executed.\n\nLooking at the charts we see that the $236 range showed strong support on three separate occasions.

I\'m not an expert in Nubits, but I believe the claims below are correct. If I say anything that is objectively false, please steer me straight.\n\nHere\'s the difference as I understand it. First of all, BitShares has BTS, the native token of its blockchain (as BTC is to the Bitcoin blockchain). The BTS represent equity in the BitShares network. Since the network, in principle, has value (as a payment network, decentralized exchange, etc.), each BTS has real-world value.\n\nNow, whenever a bitUSD is created (which can be done by anyone, instead of just centralized parties as in Nubits?), $2-3 worth of BTS is locked on the blockchain. To reclaim those BTS, the creator of a bitUSD must buy back and destroy a bitUSD within 30 days. So every bitUSD is backed by $2-3 of BTS frozen on the blockchain. If you have a bitUSD, you will always be able to sell it for $1 worth of BTS due to these (and other) market rules, which also ensures the amount of collateral keeps up with changes in the price of BTS.\n\nI\'ve left out many of the details; a good overview is http://bytemaster.bitshares.org/article/2014/12/18/What-are-BitShares-Market-Pegged-Assets/. The same blog also has a post where Bytemaster tries to argue the bitUSD is better than NuBits, but he actually gets some of the facts wrong about Nubits. I\'m trying to avoid that here.\n\nNubits might at first appear similar to bitUSD; NuShares (or Peercoin?) play a similar role as BTS. The crucial difference, though, is that NSR aren\'t locked up as backing for each existing Nubit. Instead, Nubits are created out of thin air according to their processes. Yes, Nubits has "freezing", but what\'s frozen is Nubits, not Nushares. Your Nubits aren\'t actually backed by equity in the Nubits network. In any case, their system appears to be working fine at the moment, and maybe it will continue to do so indefinitely. I don\'t know.\n\nTo my mind, the difference is similar to what happened to the US dollar. As you probably know, it used to be that you could exchange a dollar for gold held by the US Treasury. So every dollar was backed by gold. That\'s analogous to bitUSD. Then for a while USD was "pegged" to gold, until it was finally fully decoupled, at which point it became a pure fiat currency, able to be created out of thin air, with all of its fractional reserve, inflationary joys. Nubits, similarly, has no physical backing. It\'s only worth $1 as long as everybody agrees as much, and as long as market forces can\'t overwhelm the Nubits authorities.\n\nAgain, given that the dollar is pure fiat, maybe a pure fiat crypto dollar will prove to work fine. I wish the best of luck to Nubits. I just know that, personally, I\'d be more comfortable storing my dollars in bitUSD.': 2, 'Careful with that R2, we may see one final shakedown if the price is to rise (significantly).': 2, 'Can honestly confirm you will not get raided over your distant affiliation to the theft of $75.': 0, 'Some people in here think we can actually get to any price level we want without any new money coming in.

Follow the volume!": 1, '>is it plausible that some group could either try or be in the process of attempting a corner?\n\nPossible?  Yes.  Plausible?  In my opinion, no.  I guess it depends on what you mean by "corner the market".  If you mean that an entity could be attempting to control the majority of existing BTC in circulation, then no, I don\'t think that\'s realistically possible (which I\'ll explain shortly).  But if you\'re talking about general market manipulation, then yeah, that probably happens all the time in Bitcoin markets.  Cornering a market can be as simple as building a large holding and then using those holdings to effectively manipulate the price (aka what most people around here seem to think Whales do).  But a true cornering of the market?  They might as well be unicorns.  First, there are new BTC mined every day, so the available supply is always growing larger, which inevitably makes the entity\'s position smaller each day (not by much, but still smaller).  Second, there is the fact that BTC trades on many different markets and for many different currencies.  For someone to effectively corner the market, they\'d need to run a wide-ranging trading strategy across many of the largest exchanges.  Third, attempts at cornering a market typically end up working out very differently than the entity originally intended.  Most end up breaking when the market realizes that someone is trying to corner the market, and the market basically revolts and starts taking up positions against the entity that was trying to corner the market because they understand that the entity trying to corner the market is actually very weak.  To corner the market, you\'ve got to get the market to go along with you.  Fourth, and probably the most important, is that Bitcoin itself has no underlying assets that the entity could take physical ownership of.  What I mean is that in a traditional cornering of the market, the assets have inherent value in the real world, whether it be a company\'s stock or a physically deliverable commodity.  Bitcoin can\'t really say that.  Bitcoin has value because the community gives it value through supply and demand and price discovery.  So in some ways you could say that Bitcoin\'s value is based on our trust in Bitcoin and the underlying network itself. If suddenly there is an entity that has managed to gather the majority of outstanding BTC, then that trust will be eroded within the community because everyone would suddenly be beholden to one entity to derive the price of Bitcoin.  That would cause a severe price drop in my opinion, and the entity trying to corner the market would be completely screwed.\n\n>The price has been very stable lately, seems like textbook accumulation.\n\nCould you explain better what you mean by this?  Are you referring to some market maxim that stability = accumulation?\n\nI don\'t know, man.  I think you might be seeing the things you want to see in the market (aka confirmation bias).  I say that because you\'re talking about very broad market actions and theorizing on their meanings without providing any real information that would lead you to arrive at your conclusion.  But I could be totally wrong too.\n\n': 2, 'Just pointing out that conflicts of interest are bread and butter for millions of people.': 1, 'Dick Cheney? ': 1, 'Not necessarily cornering, but something I\'ve been thinking about. \n\nA lot of bitcoiners talk about Amazon/Walmart/Exxon/Starbucks and their (potential) future acceptance of bitcoin as a launchpad for that moon trip everyone continues to wait for. Given the market\'s reaction to other large companies announcing their acceptance of bitcoin, I, along with probably most people on this forum, am skeptical. \n\nBut ok, let\'s assume you\'re a big shot at Amazon. Let\'s assume you have an interest in the Bitcoin community. Let\'s assume further that you observe this seemingly widely-held sentiment that "Amazon will send bitcoin to the moon!!!1".\n\nYou want to get in on that. At an instituonal level AND a personal level. \n\nYou can insider trade. You can accumulate a lot of coins. I don\'t know specifically how SEC regulations work, presumably Amazon, as a publicly traded company, has to disclose their investments even in unregulated bitcoin markets. Therefore, let\'s assume Amazon CAN\'T actually accumulate vast quantities of Bitcoin without affecting the market.\n\nEven with that assumption, you can still invest personal assets. You can invest however many personal assets you want. You invest five figures here and there because you\'re rich, because you believe in optionality and like the enormous upside risk relative to the downside. \n\nNow you have a non-trivial stake in bitcoin to go along with your pre-existing ability to influence decisions at Amazon. So now, whenever the opportunity presents itself, you bring up bitcoin in meetings and you start to push for Amazon to begin accepting bitcoin so that your investment can appreciate upon the announcement of the news. \n\nSomeone, some group of people, at [household name company] is going to eventually attempt something substantially similar to this. As such, I\'ve started to think that maybe the ability to legally "insider trade" this asset will ultimately lead to substantial future growth, even before considering all of the other bullish news coming out of this space.': 4, 'I hope this happens. There\'s no reason that people have to own an ENTIRE bitcoin.  Just like people can buy ounces of gold as investments, not whole kilos at a time. \n\nI\'d love to see entire coins become unobtainable and the real investment to be in satoshis or kilosatoshis, etc.\n\nJust like stocks "split" because they can\'t rise from $100 a share, but not that you can buy a "share" at $25 they jump 40% in value because they are more marketable at a retail level.\n\nAll they\'ve done with those stocks is change the color of the paper, and it\'s added value.\n\nI guess in a ultimate moon scenario trading bitcoins would be like gold bars.

We have had extreme volatility with the old rules in place and clawbacks on okcoin have always been very reasonable compared to other exchanges. For clawbacks on okcoin to be severe would require extreme and very unusual market conditions that might happen a few times a year while the change you are making will negatively affect 20x users trading on your exchange every single day. We are clearly telling you we do not want this change.": 2, "Respectfully, your comments regarding 20x being unwise to begin with do not pertain to this discussion. I am capable of deciding that for myself, thank you. This is not a discussion about the wisdom of 20x it is a discussion about a specific change in the level at which you get margin called... a change, for that matter, that makes 20x far, far more unwise and thus essentially unusable. So your comments about 20x suitability have no bearing on this issue. I addressed your point about hedging above. There will still be clawbacks under this system so you will still not be able to count on okcoin futures as a hedging environment. That's great that you are a hedger, but your earlier comment about the bitcoin futures market being half hedgers and half speculators is, in my opinion, baseless. The vast majority of this market is speculators. Now, I am not against creating a better environment for hedgers. I am not against taking measures to reduce clawbacks. What I, and many others, are against is the specific measure to change the margin call threshold for 20x from 10% to 20%. This is, as I previously said, taking a flawed system and replacing it with another flawed system, for my purposes and for the purposes of traders like me, considerably more flawed. There are other solutions and feel free to adopt one that does not change the 20x margin call threshold to 20%. ": 2, "I'm not concerned with your changes to the RMB FX rate.

Surely the complaint of 10x traders can be addressed without margin calling 20x traders at a 20% threshold which severely harms your platforms value to me and traders like me, of which I know quite a few. You are making your platform worse with this change, and I urge you to find another solution.": 5, 'I used okcoin futures precisely because your margin call threshold was 10% for 20x, this change to 20% makes your platform far less appealing to me and I will be withdrawing my coins and moving back to spot trading on finex. I seriously doubt you did this due to "feedback from your users" as I have trouble understanding why any user who enjoyed 20x leverage would request you to change the rules so that they can be more easily margin called.\n\nAs it stands, it was already incredibly easy to get margin called while using 20x, and this change basically makes 20x unusable. Your exchange is already known for wash trading, inflated volume and generally shady behavior no matter how you try to rehabilitate that image. The fact that you recently had an exodus of long standing staff also serves to negatively impact my perception of you. The only reason I continued to use you and to keep tens of thousands of dollars on your exchange is because your terms for 20x were the most favorable to the trader, but now that that is no longer the case I no longer have any reason to use your exchange.': 7, "Looks like we disagree.

Hedging activities were very limited without proper exchange risk management. I think this will improve liquidity and limit clawbacks.\n\nRegarding the 20x margin call changes. Here is my take: \n\nIf you use 20x for trading, using that much leverage is a guaranteed way of losing your shirt. For scalpers, 80% margin call should not be a concern in the first place. I personally trades 20x, but with margin at entry. I'd rather not see any clawbacks on my hedging/trading activities than worry about margin called. Most of us on bitcoinmarkets are speculators, so no one want to have a lower margin call %. That makes sense. However, futures market consist of equal part hedgers and speculators. I think this change will improve the system as a whole. \n\nI provided the feedback regarding the [exchange rate issue](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2uhas3/daily_discussion_monday_february_02_2015/co9ajxp) and [socialized loss/clawback issue](http://www.reddit.com/r/BitcoinMarkets/comments/2tlq0d/okcoin_btc_insurance_fund_and_socialized_losses/) on reddit a while back, so they did get user feedback. I do believe they use weibo's forum very often and gather feedback there instead of reddit since they are a Chinese company.\n\nAt the time, they did not acknowledge the exchange rate issue, but realized there was a discrepancy.

This adjustment reflects that feedback.\n\nOn the 20% maintenance margin call level for 20x leverage contract, I can appreciate that this is an unfavorable move for those trading on 20x leverage as it essentially lowers the 'max' leverage just prior to being margin called from 200x to 100x as margin call occurs at 1% rather than 0.5% of notional.\n\nHowever, this is precisely the reason why traders on 10x leverage would complain that those on 20x leverage were enjoying a benefit to the detriment of those using lower leverage. 10x leverage users were being margin called at 1% while those on 20x leverage margin called at 0.5% of notional position value. This means that those trading on 20x leverage would be contributing more to clawbacks on margin calls due to less orders being filled. \n\nThus post user feedback, we've made this change. Users can still open positions at 10x or 20x leverage - but now the theoretical max leverage just prior to either trader being margin called is now both 100x. \n\nPlease let me know how else we at OKCoin can be helpful.

There are always going to be clawbacks on futures and perfectly hedging is still not going to be possible even with these changes. What will happen, however, is that far more smaller traders will be margin called. There will be far more people negatively impacted by this change on a day to day basis than it will help, in the relatively rare event of a catastrophic clawback. In such an event, there will be considerable clawbacks even with these changes so I truly question the logic here. You have one person here in favor of this change and many here against it. There are other solutions, solutions that do not involve margin calling 20x users at 80% which is entirely unacceptable. You do not replace a problem with a larger problem, which is precisely what you are doing here. Yes the previous system was imperfect. This system is more so, and is intolerable to myself and several others. Let me state clearly again that this will hurt far more people than it will help on a regular basis, and still will not provide for a hedging environment that you can truly rely on.

This is a volatile market and stops on okcoin futures are unreliable at best. You said in your first comment: "Most of us on bitcoinmarkets are speculators, so no one want to have a lower margin call %. That makes sense." If it makes sense then there is no need for you to create strawman arguments about how close to my margin value I will intentionally hold losses.

The problem is, humans get worse and worse at judging odds as they get longer.\n\nOne way to judge long odds is to build them up out of less extreme odds. Another is to have lots of data on comparable cases. The former works ok if you\'re trying to estimate odds of an airplane crash, or similar event where you can get decent estimates on the component odds. The latter works ok if you have that data. Neither of which really seems applicable here.\n\nSo what is the answer? I honestly don\'t know. But I do know that trying really hard to get that probability estimate right is going to run straight into a whole bunch of known, documented cognitive biases. You might actually make things worse for yourself by trying to rely on it too strongly.\n\nThere are some other options, that I\'ve considered writing about for this sub. None of them are great.

Now regardless whether you use drugs, despise drugs or whatever, the fact is just in their normal operations they needed 35 million of bitcoin to operate. And they weren\'t even the biggest of the darknet. Now let\'s extrapolate: say they were what 1/10? a 1/3? of the bitcoin drug market and you have a basis to bitcoin\'s intrinsic value just in this arena alone. And I want to empasize that bitcoin is far beyond a drug currency today and will be even less so tomorrow, just here\'s an example where we know how much they had. If you take say $100 million worth needed for drug dealings and spread that over the 14 million bitcoins in existence, then each bitcoin has about $7 of value just on it\'s utility for illegal trade.\n\nNow you can run those numbers in other areas using bitcoin like https://www.bitpesa.co/ and add that in. How much bitcoin does a company like this have on hand? Maybe not a whole lot today, but next year?

At the time of investing, you have a probability distribution, not an outcome.  Saying "If A goes to 0, than it doesn\'t matter what the weight was" is nonsensical unless you\'re a time traveler.  It\'s like saying, "if it doesn\'t rain tomorrow, there\'s no point in having an umbrella."  We don\'t know today which assets will go to zero and whether it will rain tomorrow.  All we can do is come  up with our best estimate for the probability.  If the weatherman says there\'s a 50% chance of rain tomorrow, I weigh the benefit of having an umbrella (staying dry) multiplied by 50%, minus the cost of the umbrella (having to carry it around all day).\n\nYou actually make a valid comment about "risk" though.  There are two very separate numbers to calculate.  The first is the expected value, which I provided the equation for.  The second is the "risk", which has a lot of different ways to be considered, but the simplest is simply maximum loss.  The problem with only looking at risk though is that the "risk" of every single investment is basically the same.  There\'s always some scenario in which your investment will go to zero.  So, that would suggest that investing in bitcoin is just as risky as investing in corporate bonds, or in real estate, or in collectible pokemon.  Obviously that\'s wrong.  We still have to consider the *probability* that an asset goes to zero.  \n\nSo, there are millions of assets we can invest in.  All can go to zero, and all go increase in value 10x in certain scenarios.  So how do we pick between them?  We first come up with a best estimate of expected value, and then we consider the probability weighted risk.\n\nAlso, I\'d suggest googling, "marginal VAR."  Basically, if an investment is uncorrelated with your other investments, it adds much less risk, sometimes zero risk, to your overall financial situation.  Bitcoin has a very low correlation to other assets, so if you have most of your money in stocks/bonds/real estate and put 20% of your wealth into bitcoin, you\'re adding very little risk to your total portfolio.  ': 2, 'Bitcoin, as a monetary asset, will succeed or fail based on its relative advantage, over other assets, in storing and transmitting value.

Short-term, this makes the market a "random walk."  From this perspective, there is no such thing as a trend; bull and bear markets don\'t exist.  Saying that bitcoin is "trending down" or in a "bear market" is equivalent to saying, "due to a long series of new information releases or random fluctuations, the price of bitcoin has generally fallen over the last xxx months."  It\'s purely a descriptive statement of past performance and tells us nothing about the future price.  You could just as easily say replace "downward trend" with "a series of dips and rallies that vaguely resemble this painting by my 2 year old nephew."  Under this idea, for the price of bitcoin to actually *trend* down, it would take not a single bearish fundamental (which would be immediately priced in), but a long series of new bearish fundamental changes (or a long series of random downward fluctuations, the equivalent of flipping tails 40 times out of 50 coin flips.\n  Now, the efficient market hypothesis is wrong.  It\'s bull.  But, it\'s a useful starting point, because most markets are mostly efficient most of the time.  So it\'s a useful starting point to figure out when and why we think a particular market is acting inefficiently.\n  When you said that you thought future events are priced in ahead of time, that\'s a basic argument for the efficient market hypothesis.  But then you talked about trends, which are antithetical to the hypothesis.  One assumes that investors are rational, and the others assumes that they are not.  If investors are rational, real trends can\'t exist, because the price would immediately adjust to its endpoint.  Put another way - if we all expect bitcoin to trend downward to $100, it would instantly become $100.  Because anyone who owns bitcoin would sell today at $245, and no one would buy it until it got near $100.  So the entire "trend" would occur instantly as a price gap.  This doesn\'t happen for lots and lots of reasons.  That we can get into separately if you want.\n\n  Separate point - supply is not constant.  Some days almost all selling is done by miners.  Other days, an early adopter decides to sell 10,000 coins to buy a mansion.  Other days a trader looks to take profits and coins they bought at $220 and sell a big block.  I don\'t know what percentage of selling is actually miners versus speculators versus early adopters versus buy and holders who get discouraged.  \n\n  So, my question with halving is why we\'d expect it to be priced in at a particular time.  Your answer, that investors would bet on the price increasing around the time of halving, but wouldn\'t want to take the volatility of owning bitcoin for too long, is kind of circular.  If speculators expect bitcoin to rise in price immediately after halving, they\'ll buy immediately before halving.  But if speculators expect other speculators to buy at that point, they\'ll buy a week earlier.  But then speculators will expect that, so they\'ll buy a week earlier..and a week earlier...everyone wants to buy before everyone else pushes the price up.  So, people who want to speculate on the price rising because of a certain event in the future would have to buy now.

I'll elaborate further.\n\nThe reasoning for why there are too many longs is that they have been increasing *in opposition* to the price decreasing. Here I'm making the assumption that as longs are opened, the price should be increasing for those longs to be in a profitable position. In the case that the price is going down (as it has been considerably in the last month), that means all those positions that should have pushed the market up are now under water and losing equity.\n\nI agree that longs or shorts going up *by itself* means nothing. My argument however is that the divergence between the price against the rise of the opposing swaps causes price explosions to either side as one side's positions lose value. This obviously can't happen too often, it takes months to build the pressure necessary for such moves.

The people who *need* bitcoins for these transactions are poorer than those who don\'t. \n\n2) If people bought bitcoins at a higher price, they\'re not going to want to "sell" them by buying goods at retail, because in their minds they\'re paying a much higher price, and would rather wait until the price rises again before selling them for goods.\n\n3) Every time someone accepts bitcoins for goods or services, and keeps them in bitcoins, they are making a market bet the same as any trader.

Last June, we were approached by a group of investors who offered $120k as a partnership.  We decided not to accept the offer because, among other reasons, they were proposing to create a company with four businessmen, one developer, and one tester.\n\nOf course, a company needs people to do the accounting and marketing.  However, the proportion of skills needs to be balanced.  I don\'t think it\'s surprising that developers are unwilling to create partnerships where lots of people with the wrong skills are brought in.  As you pointed out yourself, having developers is the most important skill.  If we ever decide to seek investments, we will look for one person to handle the business part of the company, not four, because it doesn\'t make sense to weigh down a company with excessive management.\n\nI see developers who try to limit the number of non-technical employees as people who are smart and spend money wisely.  If you can hire an employee for three months and you pay him for marketing that fails, you have nothing better than when you started.  If you hire a developer for three months, you have a product with more features.\n\nCryptsy is an example of a business that has not followed this philosophy.  They have a lot of customer service representatives who reply within 10 minutes when you need to reset a password.  Trying to contact them for any more involved reason, like that there are bugs in their trading system or that their wallets are out of sync, results in a delay of several days before a response.  Their homepage has promised that things are "coming soon" for years.  As a result, they\'ve lost hundreds of dollars of fees from us because we go to other exchanges when there is a problem their technical people don\'t resolve quickly.\n\nThe industry is filled with people who market much, accept lots of investments, promise a release soon, and deliver little (like OpenBazaar, for instance).  Soon, some of these businesses with the wrong businessman-developer ratio are going to start to fail.  The people who survive will be the companies who quietly developed useful products without diluting their equity and burning all their money on hiring businessmen and marketers.': 1, "There were three reasons we turned down the investment.  One was that there were too many businessmen, but the second was that we didn't need the money.\n\nThere's nothing that $120,000 could have bought us that would have made our pool any more likely to succeed.  Development is cheap.  Unlike other industries, you don't need to buy a building and kitchen equipment, for example, to serve your first customer.  We purchased a powerful server, 50Mbps Internet service (which we still don't fully use), a UPS, and a generator.  We used open source tools.  \n\nThere was nothing else we needed to succeed.  What we needed to do was to get to work and to produce a pool that has better technology than the competitors, which we were able to do in about 17 months.\n\nOn Sunday, after we release the last feature we needed to reach maximum profitability, then we'll see if customers come.  So far, it seems promising.  If not, then I'll spend money to hire a marketer.\n\nI don't agree with this idea in Silicon Valley that the way to start a business is to spend months at venture capitalists and conferences and investors with big promises and no product, where you spend huge amounts of money that is disproportionate to the potential profit in the industry.

I know it did, you now have a memory of having read this semi bull post. I don't know for how long you'll remember it. But I placed it in your mind. However shortly. It was there.\n\nYour brain absorbs information. \nYou do not have full awareness of this subconscious process, let alone control over what it does with that information. There are many psychological and neurological experiments around that demonstrate that we humans are easily influenced into doing something without us even being aware that it happened. Worse even, when confronted with the reality that we've been manipulated we'll strongly defend that we made our own choice to do so.\n\nSo how is this relevant? Well, if you read this subreddit. You will read posts of bears and bulls. And while you think they don't affect your trading. They definitely do. Just not consciously. So what can you do about it? Not much, but I'd say that with being aware of it you'll certainly be better off than those who aren't.

Is worthless without the network. To anyone that agrees with the prior feel free to ignore the rest as I'm simply preaching to the choir. \n\nLook at Bitreserve, a company entirely dependent upon the Bitcoin network and one which wouldn't exist without it. Bitreserve allows customers to hold a variety of fiat currencies whilst the consumer never interacts with BTC with the entire backend being run using the payment network and unit of account. **A company whose CEO publically derides the unit of account yet is entirely dependent upon it.** Nor is Bitreserve alone, there are a number of companies building similar systems which from a consumer perspective have nothing to do with Bitcoin, they are none the wiser.\n\nThe point of mentioning Bitreserve is to illustrate the utility of the network. I assure you that all the hum and har about Bitcoin amongst serious individuals isn't because of the unit of account, that alone is relatively inconsequential, irrelevant and secondary although a requirement*. What is far more important and key to note is that of the payment network. It is a global, open source financial network which has absolutely no regard for whom uses it and for what. It allows an economy to function globally peer to peer without intermediary and interrupted (given electricity & internet.) \n\nYou hear many making the argument that the technology is very impressive yet the unit of account worthless. The implication being that it is possible to divorce the two. The technical realities of the matter are that the two are inseparable, attempting to divorce the two removes the openness of the network and removes it's impartiality. Without the unit of account there is no means by which to transfer value across the network. \n\nWhat I think that many are missing is that it does not have to be priced in Bitcoin. **The unit of account simply allows the entire system to function and operate.** You don't even have to hold your wealth in Bitcoin whilst using the network. The main attribute of Bitcoin is the network, and it needs the unit of account to function. You don't have former heads of staff from large financial firms and multiple .dot-com entrepreneurs investing and joining Bitcoin companies because of the unit of account. It is the payment network. It always has been. \n\n[Would you like to know more?](http://www.scribd.com/doc/188644617/Bitcoin-Intrinsic-Value-Wedbush-Report-December-2013#scribd)\n\n\n*I agree with a lot of the arguments for the unit of account from a store of value to being a means to protect your wealth against any and all actors. But this hinges entirely on the payment network growing and being adopted. Without the network it is worthless, just look at DOGE et al.

The fact that bitcoin is highly divisible is actually a very forward thinking solution to a problem we likely wouldn't face for years and years and years.  But once we are approaching the twilight years of bitcoins still being mined with each new block (which will end completely in 2140), the currency will get increasingly deflationary and that divisibility will be essential to it's continued use in regular transactions.

If another bubble were certain, we would have hit it by now. People are greedy and would have kicked that thing off ASAP. They don\'t have some big grand plan to suppress the price as low as possible and try to "shake out the weak hands" (which is the dumbest saying imo that exists around here).

Unless you believe the market is 100% in control of "these people", they don\'t have a reason to drive the price down. Why would they? People always say to shake out the weak hands so that only the strong hands remain for the big rise. Who cares? If I have a bunch of BTC, it\'s a MASSIVE risk to try and "drive the price down". Why would they do it? So they can buy in more and more slowly over time? That only works if you think they alone can keep the price supressed, which just isn\'t feasible. People need to get this idea out of their head that some big grand group of whales is purposefully keeping the price down for their own gain. The logic doesn\'t work, and the people who believe it have this idea in their head that bitcoin is currently worth double its value but is only low because "the man is keeping it down". No. The price is where it is at pretty much organically. There hasn\'t been some conspiracy to make it fall consistently for the last year. Stop being delusional. The price is the price because the market says it is.

CASEY\nUpdated March 23, 2015 3:52 p.m. ET\n0 COMMENTS\nNasdaq OMX Group Inc. has agreed to provide New York-based startup Noble Markets with core technology to power a new marketplace aimed at allowing companies and institutional investors such as hedge funds to trade bitcoin and related digital-currency assets.\n\nAccording to a joint statement provided to The Wall Street Journal, Noble\xe2\x80\x99s platform will use Nasdaq\xe2\x80\x99s X-stream trading system, a high-tech system for matching market participants\xe2\x80\x99 orders that is used by more than 30 exchanges and marketplaces worldwide. Nasdaq will also provide marketing support.\n\nThe agreement follows other Wall Street initiatives that could pave the way for financial institutions to own and trade digital currencies, which fans say have the potential to make the global financial system more efficient but which have also been marred by price fluctuations, investment scams and cybersecurity concerns.\n\nRecent developments include: the New York Stock Exchange\xe2\x80\x99s investment in bitcoin exchange Coinbase; regulatory approval of public trading in the Digital Currency Group\xe2\x80\x99s Bitcoin Investment Fund; former J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. executive Blyth Masters\xe2\x80\x99 appointment to a lead new digital-asset settlement service; and news earlier Monday that former NYSE Chief Executive Duncan Niederauer will work as an adviser to bitcoin derivatives platform TeraExchange.\n\nIn an interview, Noble Chief Executive John Betts said he believes Nasdaq\xe2\x80\x99s involvement will help dispel investors\xe2\x80\x99 concerns about the risks of trading in digital currencies. \xe2\x80\x9cThey can say, \xe2\x80\x98These are sophisticated organizations; they have done their due diligence, and if it\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for them, it\xe2\x80\x99s good enough for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nMr. Betts has previously headed the development of electronic trading platforms at Goldman Sachs,Morgan Stanley and UBS. His company is backed by venture-capital firms Blockchain Capital of San Francisco and Tally Capital of Chicago.\n\nIn the statement, Lars Ottersg\xc3\xa5rd, Nasdaq\xe2\x80\x99s executive vice president for market technology, said his company was looking forward to working with Noble\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccutting edge, new endeavor for the long term in addressing the needs of the digital currency space.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nBitcoin is the first and best known of a variety of digital-currency systems that began when the software program launched in early 2009 by an unidentified person or persons using the name Satoshi Nakamoto. Managed by a network of thousands of independent computers that collectively verify and maintain a public ledger of transactions, these systems allow users to exchange digital currency and other tokens of value without using fee-charging intermediaries such as banks.\n\nIn its early years, enthusiastic individual investors, who saw bitcoin as a potential challenger to traditional currencies, flocked to largely unregulated, online exchanges and bid its price up to a peak above $1,100 in late November 2013. But in 2014, as regulators started drafting rules covering bitcoin and negative headlines linked it to illicit drug sales, security breaches and the collapse of Tokyo-based exchange Mt. Gox, the price fell dramatically. It now trades at around $265.\n\nMr. Betts\xe2\x80\x99s firm and others responded to those events by building more sophisticated trading infrastructure that could help instill more confidence in bitcoin and meet the stringent compliance demands of large, regulated financial institutions. Despite the negative headlines surrounding bitcoin, these new entrepreneurs maintain there is considerable interest in it among hedge funds and other institutional investors, participants whose deep pockets could help bring some stability to bitcoin\xe2\x80\x99s volatile price. Wall Street, they say, is warming to the idea that the technology behind bitcoin, if not the currency itself, could slash costs from the global financial system.\n\nUnlike pioneering offshore websites such as Mt. Gox, which pooled funds from retail investors into common accounts with minimal disclosure, Noble\xe2\x80\x99s system will be limited to corporate and institutional investors whose funds will be placed in transparent, segregated accounts safeguarded by third-party institutions, Mr. Betts said. Settlement and clearing will occur through a sophisticated, proprietary model that includes real-time reconciliation of account balances, he added.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a lot of demand\xe2\x80\x9d for digital currency trading from institutions, he said, noting that his early conversations with investors involved a lot of \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is bitcoin?\xe2\x80\x9d questions, whereas now he hears, \xe2\x80\x9cBitcoin is interesting, but where can we trade?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d He added, \xe2\x80\x9cA lot of them just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t do business with the existing exchanges.

': 10, 'Despite lack of mainstream adoption, I still think Bitcoin is a valid replacement for physical cash (not necessarily online electronic payments), and also has numerous niche applications that in aggregate support some kind of "intrinsic worth" argument. The things holding Bitcoin back are lack of public knowledge/interest, bad press/reputation, excessive complexity and difficulty using it, volatility, security and a mismatch between actual and perceived benefits of the system. It is difficult to predict whether we will make inroads into addressing these difficulties, however I think the promotion of Bitcoin as a replacement for physical cash could drive greater public interest and adoption as this is a low risk option over asking people to dump large amounts of money into it as a high risk speculative investment (although this is still arguably one function of Bitcoin). Insured third party wallet providers could also make use of the system more popular.\n\nOn the technicals, the current rate of inflation may likely continue to slowly erode the value of Bitcoin until accessible options for usage and investment become available, therefore I predict a period of relative stability between $150 and $300 until Summer, where the roll out of services could fuel upward movement up to the $400 mark, or an unknown "killer app" could create another bubble to unknown higher values.\n\nFrom my reading into financial bubbles, my understanding is that people become better at predicting their movement as times goes on, so I find it unlikely that we would see anything as dramatic as last time, and I don\'t believe we will exceed the previous ATH for some years if at all.\n\nI don\'t foresee the release of an alternative technology that would make Bitcoin irrelevant and/or drive the price towards zero.': 6, 'That is very literally not true though.

I do not think we will ever see any 20x growth bubbles like we did from $10 to $266 in early 2013 or effectivley zero to $32 in the beginning. As liquidity increases and the "size" grows the wavelength of these patterns expand out and things slow down over time. This again is presuming there is long-term vested demand for something like this and we aren\'t just a passing fad who decided to test out if internet digital cash is possible. \n\nAlso have to agree with you about ranging between two values. I have noticed the market velocitiy liquidity and spreads have tightened up and slowed down greatly over the last few weeks and months ever since we finished the whipsaw of $370 - 166 - 315. Now the real test is if equlibrium can hold the cost of mining, which will also be very interseting to see play with the block reward halving coming up in a little more than a year along with us waiting for that killer app... that\'s what we\'re all waiting for as speculators in this giant game. Someone else to pass the ball off to.\n\nI understand I have a cognative bias because of being vested in this, but I believe that most long-term people invested into this have been scared out. The volume and "shock" factor of $166 was quite exceptional, we will have to drop another echalon of price brackets to start scaring out the next wave of long term holders and even then, the market has been surprisingly resilient. I\'m curious to see how this summer develops because ideally I would love for us to go sideways and stabilize for an extended period of time. Not keep going down. Not retrace back up. Just sideways, stability, and consolidate a baseline. Equlibirum within a functioning economy (regardless of how big). \n\nThe fact that we have "only" lost 80% of the value with Mt.Gox pumping hundreds of millions of dollars of fake money into the system to inflate the price is surprising enough to me, looking at patterns in altcoins that loose 95%+ Bitcoin has overall been surprisngly resilient over the last 18 months since the last mania. \n\nQuite an interesting experiment we are all involved in though, I must say.\n\n': 1, 'Hodling': 2, 'It\'s not "scare tactics."

Our 16 month bearish downtrend is a correction period from a +1000% increase in price over a 1 month timeframe. Current bitcoin prices are healthy because there is stronger trading volume to support them and they are comparatively much less volatile.\n\nThe Wall Street adoption phase of bitcoin started in early 2015 with the announcement of the NYSE investing in Coinbase.

"Exchanges" that offer basic features more like a broker service than an actual trading engine. Included in the service are built in wallets, merchant services and directories, API\'s, and so on, creating an all inclusive platform that does many things. \n': 2, 'Text from site:\n\nAs Bitcoin edges ever closer to mainstream consumers, its interface is changing to provide maximum convenience to those who transact. Like the evolution of Internet payments 15 years ago, the Bitcoin ecosystem is quickly shifting towards ease of access and effortless use when it comes to attracting prospective users.\n\nThe changes are happening apace. Already gone are the days of multi-step, unintuitive exchanges and unreliable processes. Now, Bitcoin businesses who deal in customer funds are obliged to have in place a raft of security and compliance measures in order to appeal to the mass market. They must also be as simple as possible to use and crucially offer all the flexibility of use that makes Bitcoin appear as \xe2\x80\x98useful\xe2\x80\x99 a transaction medium as cash or a credit card.\n\n **Bitcoin Universal Services**\n\nEnter Bitcoin universal services (BUS), those businesses providing not just an exchange or not just a wallet, but merchant payment processing services and even add-ons such as debit cards linked to their own infrastructure.\n\nWhile still less common than the vast number of operations offering such services separately, BUSs are unique in offering a one-stop shop for users and merchants and in so doing have a vital role to play in \xe2\x80\x98closing\xe2\x80\x99 the Bitcoin ecosystem.\n\nPerhaps the best-known operator in the BUS field is Coinbase. With a global presence and reliable tools backed by a conspicuous amount of investment from its big-name supporters, its ability to provide a consumer exchange, wallet and merchant acceptance solution is continuing to prove immensely popular.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cOur goal is to become the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest exchange,\xe2\x80\x9d CEO Brian Armstrong said upon the release of Coinbase\xe2\x80\x99s exchange facility, the first fully-licensed operation in the US.\n\nThe advantages of having an integrated multi-tool solution are of course clear. The user has a wallet and exchange in one place, with the specialized processes ensuring funds are handled securely despite the high profile of the host. Both user and business also benefit from the security of having the same operator deal in all stages of the B2C transaction process.\n\nThere is, however, a drawback. With much power comes much responsibility, and it is the way in which Coinbase, as a form of \xe2\x80\x98test case\xe2\x80\x99 for the major go-to service in Bitcoin, has handled issues of customer data and centralization which has become the subject of mounting criticism.\n\nThe company\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory stance has also caused friction with the cryptocurrency community. Cases such as the recent altering of its terms and conditions to allow retention of user credit histories led commentators to treat Coinbase with suspicion rather than encouragement. Fears of a \xe2\x80\x98too-big-to-fail\xe2\x80\x99 company, in the wake of Mt. Gox and the threat of 51% mining attacks, are still present in the Bitcoin community.\n\n **Smaller scale for the greater good**\n\nWhile the dust continues to settle, other providers are stepping up to provide the same and even more comprehensive user and merchant packages on a smaller scale. Hong Kong-based ANX has been offering an exchange, wallet and associated debit card for the past year.\n\nIn Europe, UK-based startup SpectroCoin has been offering the same features since 2013, recently with the interesting addition of non-bitcoin spending; users can pay in bitcoin using funds from their wallet stored in fiat currency (euros).\n\nThe move is designed to address volatility issues, which can cause unexpected results during PoS transactions.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cIf Euro wallet is chosen, an exact amount of bitcoins required completing the transaction is exchanged and the transaction is sent to Bitcoin network,\xe2\x80\x9d a press release from SpectroCoin released this week explains about the new payment format.\n\nCEO Vytautas Karalevicius believes that in future, there should be around twenty BUS operators around the globe, each with a 5% share of the market. A setup such as this would maintain the health of the ecosystem, instead of having a single dominant player like Coinbase creating more centralized conditions, much like PayPal in fiat payments. SpectroCoin, which has sustained its own growth without VC funding, is hoping to strike this balance.\n\nCoinTelegraph reached out to Karalevicius for his take on the developing BUS model, its advantages and challenges facing key industry players in the current environment.\n\n **CoinTelegraph:** Bitcoin universal services are less numerous than those offering just one or two products such as wallets or exchanges. What do you think the benefits for consumers and businesses are of using an overarching company rather than several different ones?\n\n **Vytautas Karalevicius:** Firstly, the answer is based on a misconception of bitcoin being a free method of payment. Yes, it is cheap and quick, and it is absolutely dominant to other payment methods if we compare by speed/price ratio, however the more blockchain transactions are involved (from exchange to wallet, from wallet to merchant), the more expensive use of bitcoin becomes. Therefore, using the universal service provides a number of transactions are done off the chain, so clients can achieve cost savings.\n\nAlso overarching companies like SpectroCoin can offer better rates as they have both buy and sell sides inside the house, while solely merchant service providers are dependent on third parties to exchange bitcoins to fiat on behalf of their clients, which adds additional costs.\n\n **CT:** Coinbase is a good example of such an operation, but they have faced criticism about data handling and centralization. What do you think about that? Can you have a company control many facets of the transaction process without users giving too much trust away?\n\n **VK:** The answer cannot be universal, as it extremely depends on the domicile of the service provider, for sure a company in US will have stricter data handling requirements than practically any company registered outside USA. For sure, Bitcoin companies as any financial company should secure the privacy of their clients as a "bank secret." However, using universal service providers is not a take it or leave it option. Clients can only use one or couple of services service provider is offering and diversify his trust among several different service providers.\n\nRegarding centralization, the beauty of Bitcoin is its decentralization and it has to be decentralized at every level of its ecosystem: mining, exchange, wallets and etc. If there would be only one dominant mining pool, bitcoin would not be decentralized anymore, also if there would be only one dominant exchange such as Coinbase, it will become more like PayPal with having a lot of off chain transactions and become a closed payment system. Eventually that kind of exchange would be too big to fail, that\'s why there has to be several small-medium size bitcoin service providers globally, so even if one or two of them fails, Bitcoin as a concept would not be affected.\n\nOn the other hand I see Bitcoin as a protocol, like an email and the service SpectroCoin provides are Bitcoin web client with additional features such as exchange it is very similar to a thing Gmail does for e-mail. So as for email to stay decentralized people should use other email service providers not only Gmail in the same way people should use different Bitcoin service providers.\n\n **CT:** Can you tell us more about the future plans for SpectroCoin as a universal provider?\n\n **VK:** Our key future plans are introducing additional currencies both fiat and digital, so we could follow our idea of allowing our clients to split three fundamental properties of money apart (to use Bitcoin as a medium of exchange, Euros as method of account and some other asset class as a store of value). \n\nWe are also aiming to become first European BUS with debit cards issued for clients. Currently our project, Spectrocard, is in a beta stage without bitcoin offered as a deposit option as we are testing our debit card system with more typical users at the moment. We are working for additional cash deposit options in the near future.\n\nElsewhere, we are expanding our merchant network both by ourselves and through partners, so soon there will be a wide network of locations accepting bitcoin in our region. Also, we have introduced vouchers, which can be used for non-digital off chain transactions among people.': 1}, ('Seeking Consensus: When Does Bear Trend End If $200-300 Range Is Maintained?', 17): {"We've been bouncing around the the 2-300 range for months now.

It is often better than a regular stop loss because it will automatically increase your sell price to make more and more profit.\n\nUsing a stop price based on a value or percentages just depends on your tactics and what you understand better. The amount to use depends on how volatile the market is that you're trading in and how risk averse you are on that position.  I would say perhaps 5-10% would be someplace to start but you need to play with it to see what works best for you.\n\nA trailing stop limit (or stop limit) is different than a trailing stop loss (or stop loss) in that it will be a limit order instead of a market order.  A stop loss order (think of it as a stop market order) will sell all of what you requested to be sold at the best price it can get once the order is triggered.  In the event of a rapidly moving market, the price may move quite a bit before all your holdings are sold.  This is called slippage.  If your trading technique requires, you can use a stop limit order which will allow you to set a limit price and prevent any holdings from being sold at a lower price if slippage does occur due to a rapidly changing market.

This is probably something worthy of being called out, and for now you\'ll just have to take our word for it until we prove it first-hand.

We\'re running this project with Agile methodology and will be releasing improvements weekly/bi-weekly, and user-submitted feedback always comes first on our list.\n\nBut in addition to adding new types of indicators, overlays, and basic features, we also have plans to grow this product well past the bounds of simple, cookie-cutter dashboards.

This subreddit\'s own "BitcoinMarkets Flair Game" seems to be a pretty accurate indicator for mid-term "tops", "bubbles", and "heights of mania" (crossing 6 on that ratio does NOT historically bode well for the mid-term price) -> http://coinsight.org/graphs/reddit_flairs_ratio.png': 19, 'That chart has this forumula:\n\nTotal USD Swaps in USD / Total BTC swaps denominated in USD \n\n(E.G I took the BTC swaps and multiplied it by the days average price to get the USD equivalent, again not perfect but still). \n\nI think that formula is flawed for a few reasons. \n\n1) my original concern mixing the interest rate with total swaps. Like I said the flash return rate varies by orders of magnitude so a spike will increase it 5, 10, 15 fold in a day and sustain that making that rise seem more significant than it should be IMO.\n\n2) the last bit, price of Bitcoin * 1000. This is weighting the price of BTC 1,000 times more than it normally is? Why are you multiplying it by 1000? I can understand that you would do it to make the numbers even (E.G a result of 7 instead of 0.0007), but the way you have the formula written I think it skews that and overweights the price of BTC in the calculation. You get COMPLETELY different results in the calculation by removing that *1000!\n\n\n\nThis is why I have come to the opinion that comparing interest rates directly, and comparing total sum of swaps directly is good, but I don\'t think either of us have come up with a formula that can correctly mix these two into a "god formula".

Actually it's often been worse. The ratio has been 10 or higher, 2.5 million in shorts vs 30 million in longs in summer 2014 for example. That is the point of my analysis, not the fact that longs outnumber shorts, it's the fact that that ratio over time changes and how that change effects the market. It seems the market has no interest in having a 1:1 ratio to balance things out, there are way more bulls than bears.\n\nYeah I agree that looking at it on anything under a monthly term is pointless, there is too much noise and short-term volatility in the data to make that type of analysis useful.

And what it shows is interesting. The data is percentage based, so for example, the upper horizontal white line means that futures are trading at a 6.5% premium on the daily candle close. And the lower one means that they are at a 2% discount (futures are 2% lower) than spot price. \n\nIt uses OKcoin spot price to compare the prices, and then converts it to dollars which the futures are traded in. OKCOIN:BTCCNY / FX:USDCNH. I can also set it up to use Bitfinex prices, or any major exchange, like this:\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/YQr4nEEq/\n\nI also find okcoin futures, while they have less data, give us a better signal, so I zoomed into the 2hr chart:\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/LGRtVMGL/\n\nSo we can see that once futures tags certain levels you are certainly correct, they can be used as an indicator as well if they are trading above or below spot prices. I find it's best for major mid-term trend reversal candles, E.G big crashes or pumps. \n\n_____________________\n\nEDIT: I'm putting this here because for more visibility because I think it is very very important and might be a big problem in your calculations:\n\n>I think the difference between interest rates when USD is on\\off demand is huge, several orders of magnitude different while the total sum of BTC swaps is on a linear scale on magnitude instead of log like the swap rates are.\n\n>Perhaps this is skewing your data? Because this means that swaps for either side become exponentially more significant when the interest rates rise from off-demand rates to on-demand rates (E.G 0.01% to 0.15%).\n\n_____________________\n\nI never thought of comparing the swap interest rates, now that is very interesting. You did the same thing I did except with the interest % rates instead of the total sum of swaps. I knew there would be different ways to calculate it, it seems you threw in the interest rate into the calculation to have that have some influence on that matter as well. So am I right in assuming that you did the same thing I did except added the swap interest rate in addition to normalizing the total actual VALUE of each of the swap markets by using the total sum in USD.\n\nVery very interesting I'm going to have to play with this myself.

Great exchange btw, just started using it.': 1, 'Interest rates are absolutely key because they can be easily compared to other asset classes to give some much needed perspective. For example: how much effect does $25 million in bitfinex longs have on the market? or $6 million bitfinex shorts? Those seem like relatively small numbers compared to the overall market cap and the daily trading volume. However, the interest rates tell a different story. At current, USD interest rates, I can receive a > 35% risk free annual return just buy selling bitcoin on the bitfinex spot market for usd (better than pretty much every asset class I know of except for high frequency trading hedge funds). Thus, IF (big if) I am bullish on the price of the bitcoin (let\'s say for the next year) my optimal strategy is to sell bitcoin on the spot market and speculate long in the futures market "to hedge my usd exposure" (if you are ambivalent to the price of bitcoin, see the comment by BitMEXdotcome below, you should buy spot and sell futures). However, in mass, this creates a feedback loop where speculative demand shifts to futures and the demand left in the spot markets is for.......actual commercial use / goods and services exchange, which is very small (see: https://blockchain.info/charts/estimated-transaction-volume-usd?timespan=2year&showDataPoints=false&daysAverageString=1&show_header=true&scale=0&address=).\n\nNice futures/spot charts btw.

It could be since I chose to use the quarterly future (whereas it seems you used the weekly ones). I chose the quarterly because, just from observation, it seems to detach most from the underlying spot price in times of mania.': 7, "Can't wait to re read all this jazz sober in the am!

But most people, at least on bitfinex, seem to inherently want to go long (on margin) bitcoin spot. Also, if you were to get margin called on your future margin sell (price went up) and then the price went straight back down without initiating another sell, you'd be out of luck, right? So, it requires a bit more active management than setting your swaps to be locked in for 30 days at the flash return rate and then automatically re-initiated whenever any funds are returned.": 4, 'Whoa, thanks for the first chart, great to see the confirmation.\n\nInterest Rates:\nBut you need to weight the interest rates by their respective monetary bases. Think about it: if IN TOTAL $5 million in short swaps are taken out at but at an interest rate of .1% per day (which is also the current long swap rate), on your chart this would be an extremely "bullish" event with higher green lines - not accounting for the fact that there are currently 6x as many long swaps taken out at the exact same rate .1% per day. The long swaps, in total, are 6x more costly to maintain (6x more likely to (long) squeeze?). Also, by looking at how many bitcoins this cost equals instead of just its usd value, we can get a better picture for how many bitcoins would be sold in a margin call event and how leverage-fueled recent demand has been.\n\nBtw, don\'t mean to knock your second chart, I have used the same myself - would have indicated a mid-term top (one that could extend for several months) at $300, no? I tend to think the interest rates predict tops better than bottoms since tops can extend for longer with less volatility whereas historically bitcoin bottoms have been violent and short-lived (such that they any interest data points would get smoothed out over several days anyways). They also seem better at predicting mid-term movements in general (months out) instead of days or even week-to-week.': 2, "Bonus: here's a chart with JUST the long cost premiums (denominated just in us dollars or just in bitcoin to see the effect that operation has).\n\n[Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/sZpTXug.png)": 1, "1) true yeah I didn't fully realize that, thanks for pointing that out.

Most bitcoiners don\'t realize that "Wall Street" is already very much involved in the markets, but these are professional traders who will profit off of moves and volatility in any direction - especially on an asset that has aspects of gold (VERY little fundamental value) but with a smaller market cap (more volatility).': 8, '2) hmm, maybe make sure the parentheses are correct?

This one is about cutting losses in trading.\n\nIn trading, you can only control the entry, exit and position size. Once you are in a position, price is out of your control. If your trade setup is good, your position is statistically likely to be profitable, but never guaranteed. I personally think our brain sucks shit when dealing with random variable logics: poker, trading, and gambling. Traders, including myself, hold on to losing positions for too long, not willing to cut loss, not willing to let it go to fight another day.\n\nEver read those motivational books/poster about success or perseverance? "Do not give up, do not lose hope" they said. For typical careers and businesses, having such mentality is good and often attributed by those who are successful. Unfortunately, in trading, this type of mentality is a disaster. \n\nI tend to analyze my losers more than winners, so I\'ll go over my most recent big loss. [I longed at 255 last week](http://ibankbitcoins.com/btc-trade/long-25525-same-previous-trade-after-settlement) expecting the market to be bullish. I went long because bitcoin price is still at a higher low and market bounced nicely off of 240 support. Shortly after entry, bitcoin price did bounce higher to about 263 the following day, pretty good trade I told myself!. My original trading plan was to ride it while it is profitable and get out if price falls to entry, essentially a risk free trade!\n\nBy Monday, market crashed back down. Within a 15minute bar, market dropped to 245. My alerts went off, I told myself that I would sell as soon as price bounce a little. It is a low volume day and we are at support. Nope, market says fuck you, no bounce. Some dip buying, but not a bounce. I try to rationalize myself, still expecting this imaginary bounce. The worst part about this is the psychological aspect of trading; it is a total mind fuck to have a winner turned into a loser. Hopium was strong during this short period of time.\n\nMarket dropped another 10 points after the weekend to 235, still no bounce. I yelled at my computer, "Where are the buyers? da fuck? aiiiii, I am done" I got out because my experience and discipline told me so, but I was still upset! Hope, and self-rationalization cost me 11 more points.\n\nIn trading, what is clear to me is to keep losses at a controllable level, 3-5% is reasonable. Exits might need to be wider or narrower, but use position size instead of bigger % of account instead. There will always be new trading opportunities, lets fight another day. I hope my experience was helpful, leave a comment on what you think, share your losing stories, you\'ll feel better.

I have learned the following. \n\nI don't jump in the chop after a big move. I have gotten wrecked this way too many times. \n\nI don't trade after a big profit. It's like my judgment is damaged somehow after this and I think I can make positive trades on every little move. I have to stop for a significant period of time until I feel I'm approaching it in a measured rational way again. \n\nIf I feel dodgy about something, I enter a trivial position for learning purposes. Like two bucks. I still care enough to want to work it, but there's no consequence if it fails, and I usually learn something. Like I would have been killed with a big position. \n\nI never enter a position at more than about 20 or 30 percent of what I'm trading. I have escaped massive damage many times now by realizing I was fucked and averaging down slowly over hours and waiting for it to come back up to an exit point. \n\nThat raises another issue. Sometimes it's great to bail early, but if you do that too much, or too carelessly, you can take a lot of losses. I choose carefully whether to average down my position by buying in more, and wait for a move up to exit, or just get out.  The best choice is sometimes to carefully manage the position and find an exit, but it takes a long time sometimes. Sometimes it's also best to just bail. Depends on volume mostly for me.

This can lead to false conclusions in several different ways. The survivors may be actual people, as in a medical study, or could be companies or research subjects or applicants for a job, or anything that must make it past some selection process to be considered further.\n\n>Survivorship bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because failures are ignored, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance. It can also lead to the false belief that the successes in a group have some special property, rather than just coincidence. For example, if three of the five students with the best college grades went to the same high school, that can lead one to believe that the high school must offer an excellent education. This could be true, but the question cannot be answered without looking at the grades of all the other students from that high school, not just the ones who "survived" the top-five selection process.\n\n>Survivorship bias is a type of [selection bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias).\n\n>\n\n---\n\n^Interesting: [^Jennifer ^Carpenter ^\\(academic)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Carpenter_\\(academic\\)) ^| [^Rags ^to ^riches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rags_to_riches) ^| [^Selection ^bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_bias) ^| [^Outline ^of ^statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_statistics) \n\n^Parent ^commenter ^can [^toggle ^NSFW](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot NSFW toggle&message=%2Btoggle-nsfw+cqbqmfw) ^or[](#or) [^delete](/message/compose?to=autowikibot&subject=AutoWikibot Deletion&message=%2Bdelete+cqbqmfw)^. ^Will ^also ^delete ^on ^comment ^score ^of ^-1 ^or ^less. ^| [^(FAQs)](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/wiki/index) ^| [^Mods](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1x013o/for_moderators_switches_commands_and_css/) ^| [^Magic ^Words](http://www.np.reddit.com/r/autowikibot/comments/1ux484/ask_wikibot/)': 6, "Long @ 218\n\nhttps://www.tradingview.com/x/Zr1wXVu7/\n\nHorizontal support and everything else.

I have tried my best to document as many trades as possible to learn from each mistake, but  have a far less than perfect record in that regard as well.  However, here is a simplified list of my personal mistakes that caused me the greatest pain:\n\n1. FOMO- whether up or down, after a significant move, I have many times entered late because of this feeling.  My adjustment has been to make a prediction I feel comfortable with and enter during a consolidating period with tight stops, or wait out the volatility if I am out of a position.\n\n2. Feeding a bad trade-  Before I set the rule of rigid stops, I used soft stops, and even when the market had moved against my trade, for whatever reason, confidence in my original position remained.  I would begin my trades with 20-50% and enter the remainder with the mentality that it lowered my risk basis and would be a bigger payoff when the market moved in my favor (lol).  My solution has been to set tight-ish stops, those I feel are just beyond key resistance or are at a point that I can swallow the loss without getting upset.\n\n3. Closing early- Now I know some people believe you should always be happy with a profit, and this is true, but I got into a bad habit of selling myself short after a series of bad trades.  I had the coinbase run long from $233... sold at $255.  I had been beaten up   a lot the previous months and was just so happy to see green.  As it continued to climb I became very displeased with my profit and re-entered long when we crossed $300, but didnt sell in time to capitalize on that peak.  So I have tried to be more confident in my trades, and when they are going well, I tend to let them ride with moving stops and abstain from calling the top/bottom, but remain happy with usually 70-80% profit of the move.  (I have you to thank, /u/ibankbtc for that lesson.\n\n4. Greed- Still fighting this one, it is inherent in every trade for me.  I always feel the short/long is going to go lower/higher.  I also felt the need to have a position open almost all the time, lest I miss some big move.  Greed clouds my judgement and makes some fairly obvious trading indicators become invisible.  Placing stops, partitioning my position based on confidence, and taking breaks have helped me with this. ': 11, 'Yep! Thank you.

I thought it might have value or interest since many people here only trade straight btc. \n\nsome of the highlights were:\n\n1.) we trade btcusd for valuation not straight btc. this means that it can potentially behave like a forex pair. USD goes up btc potentially goes down and vice versa.\n\n2.) the market caps of all traded btc is incredably tiny compared to other markets. 2k coin can move the price 5%. Also this mean that anyone with 70k - 100k account balance on leverage can move the market where they see fit. (which doesnt happen in normal markets)\n\n3.) Miners producing currency every day has the potential to devalue btc (depending on how its used). Think of if the US mint prints more money, the 'world value' drops. The counter argument is the 'halving' is coming soon so even if this was true half as much will be entering the market.\n\n4.) there no such thing as market protection,market maker protection or safeties in bitcoin. Real exchanges have mechanisms to short circuit serious dumps (that happen at once) and weird market behavior. .. Currently we can do 30 dollar drops all day long and not much will stop it if someone wants to try to cause a cascade crash (340 -> 160 was proof of that) . Until these exist , the market will be too indecisive risk/reward wise for most huge investors note: investor is not necessarily VC in this discussion but traditional market investor.\n\n4.a) a US regulation based exchange doesnt necessarily solve this issue. We'll probably see a going rate divergence and arb opportunities increase. For example, china dumps 5% , US markets short circuits/doesn't respond to the dump. We now have a divergence in BTC pricing by a reasonable percentage. Buy in China, sell on US.\n\n5.) Miners are the whales of this market and they have expenses. Nice miners, sell in increments to cover their costs and not hose the going rate. Jerk Miners sell in a large blocks.\n\n\n6.)  On going rate, we are really still in the discovery phase..

I\'m far more familiar with the Winklevoss ETF (which is just a prospectus at this point) because I\'ve actually read through that stuff.  \n\n[this is the part where I stopped and went and read the 2014 BIT annual report: http://www.otcmarkets.com/otciq/ajax/showFinancialReportById.pdf?id=135313]\n\nSo BIT is an open ended fund, meaning they can issue an unlimited number of shares of the fund as necessary.  The shares are issues in baskets, with 100 shares (representing approximately 10 BTC - they pay the trust\'s fees with BTC, so over time a share will gradually be worth less than .1 BTC) in each basket.  The key here is that only "Authorized Participants" are able to "order" new baskets to be created.  I\'ve reached out to Grayscale investments to see if I can procure a list of who the Authorized Participants currently are (I believe they are required to provide this information upon request).  \n\nBut yeah, the general structure of GBTC is a little more forgiving than I initially interpreted.  Basically, if there was really large demand pouring onto the books for GBTC, one of the Authorized Participants can deposit an equivalent amount of BTC into the Trust\'s wallet addresses (making sure to send the BTC from an address that the Trust knows belongs to the Authorized Participant) and request the creation of a basket of shares.  The trust would then issue the shares, and the authorized participant can profit from the spread earned on selling the shares into the market.\n\nOh, also, the trust charges 2% per year on the NAV of the fund as expenses. That\'s a pretty sizeable expense load, comparable to hedge funds, but much higher than most mutual funds.\n\nI\'ll update more if I hear back from Grayscale today.\n\n ': 1, "Somehow I don't feel pissed at all today...": 6, '> Who\'s "we"?\n\nThe unbanked, obviously.

When I say "easy", I really mean "frictionless".  Right now, procuring bitcoin is not frictionless.  Coinbase and Circle make it *convenient* for US residents to procure bitcoin, but at a price.  Coinbase charges 1% on each buy or sell transaction via it\'s webwallet (rates obviously cheaper on the newer exchange side, but not as convenient as the webwallet).  That 1% is a pretty big fee in comparison to other traditional markets & fees.  Over time, as the markets continue to grow and solidify, Coinbase won\'t be able to continue asking for that 1% commission.  It will take time, but the friction of moving between BTC and fiat will eventually be greatly reduced.  We\'ve already made great strides in the past few years towards making bitcoin more easily accessible, but I think it will still be a few more years time before I will consider access to Bitcoin to be "easy" (frictionless, or as frictionless as possible) in an economic sense.': 2, 'Sunk cost fallacy.': 6, 'LoL ( charging stick for massive poke)': 2, '>Paul opposes same-sex marriage, saying that same-sex marriages "offends" him[41][42] and...it is as a "moral crisis that allows people to think that there would be some sort of other marriage"[44][45] as an alternative to what he calls "traditional" marriage.\n\nA libertarian who opposes liberty for some.

": 1, "For this comparison, ratio of funded vs borrowed longs doesn't matter in old system. We know sum of both in old system is ATH $31M. My assertion that sum *now* is at least $35M, possibly closer towards $50M. So we're heavier on long squeeze potential.": 1, "I will math in detail with an edit in a bit, but $31M was before a major change in BFX swap system. Currently we're at the equivalent of at absolute minimum $35M of in old system metric. Bear in mind also, $31M in swaps was when price was ~$600. Now price is less than half of that, so that's at least 2x the actual # of BTC in long positions.\n\n**Edit**:  OK will do over and try to explain this in entirety:\n\nIn **current** system, USD swaps are only taken out if you open a position more than you actually have in underlying. Say you have $100 in underlying, you can open up to $100 in a long position without borrowing USD. You also don't show up in USD swaps stats yet, because you haven't borrowed anything. If someone is trying to figure out how many people are in long positions in Margin Trading, they can't tell that you've added $100 long. \n\nOK, so moving on past your underlying. At $101, you take $1 of USD swap. What happens if  a thousand traders do the same thing at $101, with same $100 underlying each? There'd only be $1K in USD swaps total, but there's $100K in long positions not visible. OK so basically there's no *upper* bound in how many not-visible long positions there could be. Only thing you can do is guess out of your ass at average leverage ratio.\n\nHowever, we can know the *lower* bound of how many not-visible long positions there are. BFX max leverage is 1:3.33, or 30% initial margin requirement. Meaning, if you have $100 in underlying, max you can open in long positions is $333.33. Out of the $333.33 total, 30% ($100) is your underlying, 70% ($233.33) is how much you've borrowed in USD swaps. That ratio of 30%/70% = 42% btw.\n\nSo if we have $25M in borrowed USD swaps, the case where there is the *least* number of not-visible positions that are funded by sufficient underlying, is if every position was leveraged to max. Then there are an additional 42% of not-visible (sufficiently funded by underlying) longs on top of $25M. That's another $10.5M. So $25 + $10.5 = $35.5M total long positions in this minimum case.\n\nSo, you can start guessing average margin ratio that's more realistic than everybody being max-leveraged. Say that the average of leverage positions is at 1:2. This would be like if you have $100, borrow another $100 for total $200 in long position. Half and half. Applying this to $25M USD swaps would be another $25M in underlying-funded long positions. $50M in total long positions.  \n\nCompare this the **old system**. The stat of $31M in **old system** meant exactly $31M in long positions were being taken in BFX margin trading. Back then, didn't matter if you had underlying or not, if you had $100 and opened $100 in longs, you'd still show up on USD swaps +$100.\n\nAs such, I say that it's a certainty that we're above old ATH of long positions. Probably by quite a bit.\n\n-------\n\nEdit #25 or something: From another comment below, here is alternatively converting old system $31M ATH to new system #'s. \n\n**Old system**, BFX initial margin requirement was 1:2.5 or 40%. Meaning if you had $100 underlying, most you can open long position is $250. $100 (40%) of that is how much you have in underlying, $150 of that (60%) is how much you're borrowing on top of that. But way the old system worked, it would make you take out all $250 in loans, and USD swap total would go up by $250. Weird, yeah. Glad they changed it. \n\nSo $31M is old system ATH of USD swaps. Meaning $31M in total long positions, including what people were funding by underlying or not. To compare to today, we'd have to try to guess what portion of that was taken out above traders' underlying. The max case would be if everyone was max leverage. So, 60% of $31M, or $18.6M. That would be what we would compare to our numbers today, $18.6M vs $24.9M. \n\nWhat if everyone at $31M wasn't max leverage? If we guess that average leverage was 1:2 (ex: $100 underlying opens $200 long position) then the $31M ATH would be split 50:50 between longs in underlying vs not. So $15.5M, even less vs $24.9M now.\n\n-----------\n\nTL;DR either way you cut it, we're not doing better than before in terms of longs. If I've made mistake in understanding how any of the systems work, please let me know.\n\n-----------\n\nAs far as shorts, I think the stats between old system and new system are safe to compare directly.

I.e if you had $100 and borrowed $100 it doesn't matter which $100 was technically used to buy with.\n\nEither way I think fistfuls of salt are needed for any interpretation of the swaps data, both past and present, amount of swaps taken is just one parameter.

(Hopefully this is acceptable for BTCMarkets Sub)', 22): {"This is actually a fairly complex and involved legal question. \n\nThe most simple answer is that if you are a U.S. citizen you owe the IRS tax on income from whatever source derived. That tax might be at a lower rate if you hold the investment for more than a year, and in any event will generally only be due when you realize a gain - when you trade whatever the asset is and realize a profit (even if it's not in USD). \n\nThe more complex answer is that sending BTC to somebody to invest in a company sounds... questionable from a legal point of view. The regulations are complex, but selling securities without a compliant prospectus and/or within a narrow exemption from securities laws is generally illegal, which would needless to say complicate your tax situation. \n\nIf you're a partner in the business, or invested via a private placement with adequate disclosure, that's another story - but the tax implications of those transactions are also complex. ": 8, 'You\'re confusing the two pieces of the transaction though.  Investing in a company isn\'t a taxable event, true, but selling or exchanging an existing investment can be.  And that\'s exactly what you\'re doing when you use Bitcoin in an exchange.  Bitcoins are considered to be property [according to the IRS](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Newsroom/IRS-Virtual-Currency-Guidance).\n\nThis is a self-reporting event, so you wouldn\'t expect to receive anything from the company.  They couldn\'t know your basis for Bitcoins anyway.  It also means that in all likelihood, unless you invested a lot of money, the IRS will never know if you don\'t tell them, and they probably won\'t care.\n\nNow when you trade one investment for another, there\'s such a thing under IRS S1031 called a "[like-kind exchange](http://www.irs.gov/uac/Like-Kind-Exchanges-Under-IRC-Code-Section-1031)" that isn\'t taxable, but from what is written there, investments in companies (and possibly any use of Bitcoin itself) would be excluded from that exemption.\n\nKeep in mind this isn\'t a tax on the transaction, it is a tax on the value lost or gain in your investment in property (Bitcoin).  If the value of your investment hasn\'t changed, then there is no taxable impact.  But if the value of your investment has increased or decreased, then you will increase or decrease your tax liability according to your profit or loss on that investment.\n\nThis goes for all property and assets.  If you bought a plot of land for $10k, and later traded that land for a $25k tractor, then you would be taxed on the gain of the implied value of that land - $15k.  Bitcoin is viewed no differently in the eyes of the IRS.\n\nI\'ve researched this extensively since that IRS paper first came out, and I am extremely confident that what I have written here is correct according to current IRS guidelines.

Typically, a company will create an allowance for bad debt based upon a percentage of revenue and historical bad debt expense.  But you have no contract, no promise of repayment, and no precedent to set a bad debt allowance anyway.  And you\'re not a company.\n\nMy inclination then is to call the transaction a gift to the business, in which case you would be on the hook to pay for a [gift tax](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Frequently-Asked-Questions-on-Gift-Taxes) on the value of the bitcoin at the time it was transferred.

In terms of preparation, the important thing to know is when you bought it and how much you bought it for (I imagine the important fact will be the USD valuation at the time of purchase and the time of sale, even if you used bitcoin, since the IRS is still a pretty firm believer in the U.S. dollar for asset valuation).

I do this during times of high volatility and panic selling, in an effort to catch major dumps from exaggerated price movements. Usually when this happens you can make quick profit from the retracement.

When prices broke $235, Chris Dunn sent out a trade alert indicating that $216 was the next level down. Once we hit $216, buying pressure increased and prices started to reverse. If prices stay above $220 then they may start to trend upwards again but if we test $216 again they may fall into lower levels and test $200.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s interesting to note the various reactions to major price swings. If prices move up a few levels, the bulls will proclaim that the glory days of $1000+ coins are on the horizon and if the price drops, the bears start to write new obituaries for bitcoin. Our emotions can sometimes cloud our judgement and exaggerate the situation. These emotional highs and lows will sabotage our trades and eat away at our portfolio.\n\nOur most recent dump is significantly different than the $166 dump of 01/13/15. For starters the $166 dump was a record breaker for bitcoin trading volume and the descent down was fast and violent. It also preceded a $5 million hack of one of the dominant bitcoin exchanges of the western world. Those coins most likely got mixed and dumped which may have been the catalyst for the mass panic.\n\nAt the moment I think the current valuation of bitcoin is strong and steady. Traders may have a hangover from our $1200 bubble but our infrastructure is stronger than ever. Yes it may be true that several start up companies have closed shop but this is just regular business. Not every company can succeed and in a new industry, many start ups fail.\n\nAs far as user adoption goes, I see new users all the time and our growth rate is still steady. The BTA has recruited over 400 new bitcoin traders and our numbers are growing weekly. Personally, I always promote bitcoin amongst friends/family and have recruited at least 10 new people into using bitcoin. Increasing user adoption is up to us and when new users add liquidity to a scarce commodity, the price rises.

In fact, I'm so far off that when the date arrives, we are only 50% there.\n\nBut because technology (like most things in nature) advances exponentially, being at 50% means that we are almost done.  For example, if the technology we are developing is a new processor and it took 30 years to get to this point, then long ago in the first 18 months we would only expect to see something like 0.05% of progress made.  The project can fall so far behind that the processor is only half done by year 30, and it will still only require 31.5 years total to finish.  Even if somehow only 12.5% of the work was finished, I would still only be off in the prediction by 4.5 years.  This is why the advancement of technology can be predicted relatively accurately, but it is difficult to predict whether humans will actually use the technology (like bitcoins and Google Glass).\n\nAI is now better than humans at facial recognition, and facial recognition is estimated to require 1% of the brain's processing power.  In technology, when something is 1% done, that means that a large number of doublings have already occurred.

I don\'t even think "consumer adoption" or more specifically using bitcoin for shopping is relevant for bitcoins ultimate success.\n\nI think we need to start seeing some real use-cases that were either not possible before bitcoin existed, or are made much easier through bitcoin.

Spending it and selling it are both way easier than buying it (see 6% markups on LBC if you don't believe me), and that's why LTHs like me don't spend it. Why the fuck would I pay coinbase 1% (to monitor what I do with my coins) or some LBC seller 6% to buy Bitcoins and spend them if I believe that the price will be going up in the long run?

A strong shakeout is the preferred method of ending an accumulation range as it does a better job of cleaning out supply from weak hands and allows shorts to build up, making the resulting bullish move more powerful. \n\nAlthough all of the pieces are in place to make a strong case for accumulation, I'm not ruling out a further retest of the lows and possible consolidation.": 12, "I hear that. I'm not ruling it out. There is no downward price movement without additional supply of coinage to sell though, so traders will have to continue dumping to get there. And since they are in the market to make money, if it's not cost effective they won't do it, simple logic. The last dump did not attract much of a following, so you have to wonder if they are rethinking strategies.\n\nMarket makers can't simply make the market move at will, rather they are assessing market conditions constantly. They will not fight the market, they'll duck and weave like a boxer ready to take advantage whenever possible.\n\nTo fight the market means one would be buying into rallies with heavy selling coming in or selling into a strong market with no bears or weak hands left to sell with you to move the price enough to be profitable on the short side. It's a quick way to go broke.": 3, "Longs have been between $20-25 million (on average) since the middle part of last year. Since January, shorts have essentially doubled and are near all time highs. Part of this increase can simply be attributed to more traders in the market using leverage. \n\nThe contrarian idea that if the majority of market participants are long (or short) then they must be wrong, only works if they actually are wrong and on the wrong side of the market in terms of supply and demand. If the longs and bulls are well-enough capitalized to absorb the shorts, the price won't go down far enough to force them to cover. And seeing that not many longs gave in during the last dip, many of them are probably well-capitalized.\n\nIt really comes down to which side has more ammo: bulls (demand) or bears (supply). Margin calls are simply a result of the market correcting these imbalances. ": 9, 'Could be someone in a long looking to get out without bringing the price down.

If we were making new highs daily and interest rates were lower than having this ratio of long to shorts isn't such a big deal but not surging through 300 and the continued downtrend with this many longs and high interest rates makes me think the bulls are out of ammo and a long squeeze is imminent.

Still waiting for that to happen.': -2, '**Price: $246 USD/ 24hr volume: , BTC % Change (USD) = +0.33**\n\nBitcoin price action has been quite volatile lately which makes for some interesting trading  opportunities. The markets dumped throughout the weekend with strong retracements. We\xe2\x80\x99re starting to see some recovery but another dump wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t surprise me. Prices are showing strong support at around $236, which is close to the same level of support before our most recent rally. This is where I draw my line in the sand and if the price breaks this level of support I anticipate a major dump and potential shorting opportunities.\n\nIt looks like there may be another power shift amongst the exchanges. OKCoin is starting to take a lead over BTCChina for bitcoin trading volume. Theses 2 exchanges take turns at being #1 and are toe to toe in competition. OKCoin previously lost its status most likely due to socialized losses. Many of their key staff have all resigned last month for unknown reasons. It\xe2\x80\x99s difficult to determine how accurate their numbers are, given that high frequency wash trading is the norm in China.\n\nBTC-E has also managed to pick up on trading volume and has surpassed Bitstamp. They have an alleged reputation for money laundering coins from the black market and had a recent incident in freezing the stolen Evo coins. I\xe2\x80\x99m surprised their volume is so high given the risk associated with tainted coins. Fungibility is one of the major problems in having a transparent public ledger. This is a great danger to Bitcoin because a currency can\xe2\x80\x99t work properly if certain units are discriminated over others. It\xe2\x80\x99s a catch 22 because we also don\xe2\x80\x99t want thieves to get away with multi-million dollar heists without consequence.\n\nhttp://www.dailytradingprofits.com/3656/bitcoin-market-report-033015/': 2, 'Are you telling us or bitcoin?': -2, '10$ more seems impossible!': 0, '60k USD to move the entire days volume? please that shit is not tradable.
