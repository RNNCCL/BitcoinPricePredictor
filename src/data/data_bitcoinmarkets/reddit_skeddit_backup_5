Either, Core will be deprecated as they are [unable to make a sensible block size limit increase](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3xfja6/as_expected_core_is_highly_unlikely_to_make_any/) and [another implementation such as Bitcoin XT takes over](https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/3xhsel/peter_todd_if_consensus_among_devs_cant_be/).\n\nOr, the ecosystem is simply too uneducated and will be unable to make a reasonable change (especially concerning are Chinese miners here) and we will have a deadlocked Bitcoin Core causing a huge transaction backlog and increased fees.\n\nAt this point, I'm slightly pessimistic as the overall impression I get is that large parts of the ecosystem are just uneducated about what is happening and don't even want to stand up and act.

While MMM will surely drive some more demand beginning of next year, if the block size limit is not resolved (SegWit alone is not sensible given how we need a fast solution, read Jeff Garzik's recent comments on the mailing list) this could result in a critical price crash (and consequently drive some Bitcoin companies out of business) maybe even coinciding with the MMM crash.\n\nSo, in the past I said MMM is reason to be very bullish probably until the halving, but I'm not sure anymore. What has changed is that Core is completely deadlocked and will probably not implement any sort of block size limit increase except for SegWit. This changes a lot because SegWit rollout will be too slow to save the day. Therefore, January will be critical.

It just isn't enough to influence the price meaningfully.\n\nGood bots running arbitrage use an index as a target, either intrinsic to the bot or external (winkdex, tradeblock, coindesk, etc) - there are shitty bots, but you can disregard those as the good bots will dominate thereby determining how the market at large reacts to large scale manipulative events. Using tradeblock as an example, their index algorithm is intelligent - it weights each exchange price according to several factors. One of those factors compares spot price to average price of other exchanges, and reduces weight when a certain exchange deviates. So if someone market sells 3000 coins on bitfinex and their price is $20 lower than the average of other indexed exchanges, their price influences the composite index score the least. API health, volume, and other factors are also included in calculating weight to determine the index price.\n\nSo bots use an index to identify deviations and determine if they should buy or sell into those deviations. They also are funded across multiple exchanges, so in the bitfinex example, they would buy into the dip on bitfinex while immediately selling on coinbase, BTCe, okcoin to minimize market impact of their sells.\n\nThis maximizes arbitrage returns (large impact on deviating exchange pulls it back towards index rate, low impact on average exchanges preserving profit margin), minimizes risk (no waiting for fiat/BTC transfers while price is changing), and serves the purpose of arbitrage by profiting thru balancing the marketplace.\n\nThis is how exchange prices stay in balance so quickly these days compared to looser correlations several years ago. This is why many people wrongfully attribute diverse market participants as coordinated conspirators. This is why exchanges with similar banking access track more closely, while those with less common banking access deviate more greatly (more time required to move funds and balance accounts).\n\nTl;Dr To maximize market impact, 100 bitcoins won't cut it.": 7, 'Sell them all on whatever exchange has the thinnest order book on the buy side during a time when a lot of people are asleep.': 7, "100 BTC isn't a lot.

This has caused the books to be entirely bought out, sometimes leading to orders being filled at 75% or less of the actual market value.

If you do give Bitfinex a try, feel free to reach out to me with your feedback and recommendations. \n\nI\'m reminded of the great Yogi Berra quote: "Nobody goes there anymore. It\'s too crowded." I think the comedy - and maybe the genius - of this insight says something about our nomadic nature: about the excitement of finding something new and better. The drive to "move on". This drives fashion, hipster culture, and other cultural phenomenons. There\'s something exciting about being able to shun the popular. It makes people think "what does he know that I don\'t?" I think Bitcoiners in general have this tendency to be interested in the new. A new form of money, for example.\n\nBitfinex has been around for a while, so we have to work extra hard to prove that we\'re still the BTCUSD leader. In times of low volatility, we have about 25-30% of BTCUSD trading volume, and in high volatility that approaches 40+%. We\'re working very hard to meet the rising expectations of our customers, and I think we\'ve done well recently, the glaring exception being our downtime a few months ago. The TLDR explanation is this: Bitfinex started small and grew. A lot. There were infrastructure changes that needed to be made that were being put off, and those were finally met head on in the latter half of 2015. We now have a more robust, redundant, secure, and faster system than even 3 months ago. The trading engine has gone through several versions, improving speed by ~10x and capacity by many times more than that. Now with our websockets api and websockets interface (released Monday), traders are swimming in realtime trading data. As far as capacity, during the runup to 500 we set record volume numbers while maintaining all services with negligible lag - while doing nearly 50% of BTCUSD global volume. \n\nWhat is interesting is that all of us are stakeholders in Bitcoin itself, so the motivations of traders, holders, and developers alike tend to align. And I think we all hold one another to high standards, as it should be. These are historic times...': 5, "Where do you prefer to trade?

I apologize that there has been a growing discussion and hostility towards my trades, or me or both. I never intended to hi-jack the dailies. While I cannot prove anything on the internet about my trading skills or motivation, here is what I think at this moment:\n\nMy posting here, twitter and blog is intended to keep a back log/journal of my trades, ideas and the state of mind during price movements. I do not link to any paid services. Sometimes, I link to my blog or twitter for a time-stamp or a relevant link. If I want a financial job in the future, the backlog is good for my resume. I already get paid from my full-time job, trading stocks and bitcoin. My blog is exactly the same as a year and a half ago, I plan to keep it that way. If I were to pull some kind of fraud, my consistent posting here and my blog is the anti-thesis of that for the last year and a half. I do have a menu link as a referral to the exchanges I trade with, it pays for the server. Call it shilling if you will, but I have often praised and criticized the above exchanges when they fuck things up.\n\nFor those who followed me since I posted here, I didn't always get upvotes. More often than not, I got downvotes when I first started. As I consistently posted trades that were profitable on average(until recently), I gained internet points during this process. I think sharing this has value to the bitcoinmarkets community because some of these experiences are hard to come by: I was there when bitcoin was trading at 600 when i shorted it. I was there when market went deep bear below 200 when I went long. I was there when okcoin margin called literally every short up to 350 during a DDOS causing me to lose 8% of my coins from hedging, not even trading. I was there when bitfinex allowed me to trade at a leverage of more than 6:1. You often see traders yolo, come and go, but trading is a marathon.\n\nAmateur traders like my old self don't survive long enough to tell stories later. A traders profitability shouldn't be measured based on a trade by trade basis, but based on expectancy, and confidence levels like statistics or stochastic calculus. My performance has been lackluster the last few month, down 4 in a row. This is part my mistake and part unlucky. If I were to throw darts at 50% win rate, chance of hitting 4 losses is 1/16. Is my strategy failing given the small sampling size? I am not sure until more trades happen, heck my current trade might be another loss too.  If my trade performance is the price of a stock, is it a pullback for the next bull move or 100% retracement to zero? Nothing is guaranteed and i cannot say I will always be profitable, but my light at the end of the tunnel is my 6 years of stock trading experience. I am confident of that profitability will return, but I do not know when.  What do I do in this situation? I am trading at 50% size to preserve capital. Whether I've hit an unlucky streak, or a change in market conditions, I plan to evaluate and fight another day as long I have my principal.\n\nI hope this puts all of this discussion behind us so we can focus on the market and enjoy the holiday instead.\n\n": 43, 'The moment of truth.\nhttp://imgur.com/eh0h0Qi\n\n': 4, 'Saturday': 2}, ("Social data on Bitcoin and all other Crypto's - comments per hour on threads - twitter followers etc - quite a good leading indicator shown yesterday in the BTC price by the number of comments per hour....", 14): {'try zooming out on your screen then you should see the full suite of analytics tools! \n\nThink there are two kinds of moves - the moves that start in the streets and the moves that start in the citadels... so i think it has value in the right situation as a leading indicator for a vol straddle - i.e. if comments per sec goes above moving average of last 30 days then buy a call and put and wait for the volatility to play out.\n\nA street move would be visible on reddit etc - a citadel move would be spoken about on reddit after the event (e.g. futures being called etc or a big buy on an exchange etc)... \n\nIts open for debate but the stats will provide another dimension to trading alongside fundamental and technical trading - a social dimension.

I'll try to explain my thought process as to what made me change my mind.\n\nI'll start with these 2 images: [this one](http://i.imgur.com/TqvKNWp.png) leading up to the November 2013 bubble. And [this one](http://i.imgur.com/nJdZhCz.png) where we are sitting currently. Explanation:\n\nVERY similar patterns are playing out (granted they are slightly different, but it's never going to be identical for numerous reasons).\n\nBox 1) Initial mini-bubble with a ~2x increase in price.\n\n2) Price crashes wiping out ~2/3 of the gain.\n\n3) Post crash price increase in linear step pattern.\n\n4) Mini bear trap dip into hugging an upper resistance line (orange).\n\nAfter 4 comes the breakout. Nov '13 breakout gaining ~5.5x increase in price. If the same thing happens again, that puts us in the $2xxx range.\n\nBefore people are quick to point out the differences, I might as well throw my explanation in for those as well. \n\nBox 2) '13 has a flash crash whereas '15 has a crash into sideways into another crash. This is due to margin (wasn't available in '13). Allowing people to enter into more longs who thought the crash was over and that the uptrend would resume.\n\nBox 3) Nov '13 high is above box 1 high whereas '15 is not. Again due to margin. To convince people (myself included) into thinking this is the top, bull trap, etc and shorting. These shorts are then used to fuel the rally.\n\nBox 1) higher gains in '15 compared to '13 due to explanation for box 3.\n\nSo that's what I noticed. It may or may not make sense. It may or may not even be valid. These next few days are going to be VERY interesting. I believe it's either: break up into potential massive bubble, or top out and head back down to ~$300 range. Of course, as I'm typing this we're dropping a few bucks.\n\nOne thing I always believed would be the next massive bubble would happen when it was least expected.

The small holders--such as the folks around reddit--are not going to make much difference.  They are either holding long term, or they are trading away.  The large holders are using more sophisticated trading methods that slam down just about every gain with resistance.  They have the money and the where with all to keep the prices rising in a more managed fashion.\n\nThe mania of Nov '13 was also the first time that it was relatively easy to get into bitcoin.  The earlier manias were pretty limited as far as broad participation.  That limited the supply, and when there is no offer on the table, the price will go up fast.

Difficulty was pumped hard, Supply was reduced: https://blockchain.info/stats We used to produce 4,600BTC/day in the last month but right now we are producing the usual 3,600. This means less selling pressure from miners. I also think that we have reached almost peak status with Hashing rate and we'll return to the linear growth.\n\n2. The more the price goes up, the more weak hands leave the market. Those who are not interested in Bitcoin (longer term) or those who wanted to close their old positions without loses (or minimal loses) are now gone. Stronger hands are very unlikely to mass-panic-sell at $500, or $800 or even $1,000.\n\n3.

I also expected small rally right before settlement and since bear pennant did not break down, reshorting later if 410 broke or at a higher price on late Jan 1st seemed like a smart move.

I\'m a long term holder but I think you\'ll find my view surprising.\n\nI think MMM was definitely a big part of the initial vertical pump to $500, and could also be a big part of the rise back to $470 after that crash. What I don\'t agree with you about is that the guys running this scheme are still holding enough Bitcoins to expose themselves to the risk of losing considerable profits from an extremely risky ponzi scheme that will put target on their backs for the rest of their lives. So I guess my view is that they have liquidated all of their BTC holdings by now, or at least 90% of them. Even if getting hard cash for them is hard, opening an equal size short position on futures or on margin is not hard. I.E. you have 1000 BTC, open a 1000 BTC short contract on future. You now have exited your BTC position while still holding that BTC. Either way though, whether selling them for cash or shorting, you have sold off and the market has adjusted after that. If the MMM scheme is actually over, then what else would they possibly be waiting for to get out of their BTC positions?\n\nWhat does this mean? I think it means that a price rise is a price rise. Same as willy bot on Gox back in the day. Did it unreasonably bubble up to $1200? Yup. It still took 2 years to get down to prices before that bubble. \n\nTL;DR MMM is done, the prize is at $430 or so currently. What else matters? Why does it matter that MMM was part of what drew attention and new money into bitcoin? I guess you could argue it doesn\'t look good, or "moral" but I would argue who gives a fuck. \n\nThe only way you constantly bringing up MMM has any bearing on the future of the market is if you still think they have tons of BTC that they are just speculatively holding onto right now, and therefor risking their profits. I find that part very hard to believe.

A simple example would be your total position is 100 contracts and you have breached at or below the equity threshold -- this in turn opens a limit sell order slightly into the book (to hopefully fill/clear it) but if there is a 10k bid wall there the price that is entered won\'t be reached if that makes sense as there are enough contracts between current price and that limit price.

For example, at a time there were retracements during weekend as the banks don't work during the weekend, but as soon as people noticed and tried to profit from it, the weekend pumps began, and for the past two years price movement has been pretty random during the weekends.": 7, "Alright, that's what I was expecting.\n\nI'll just set up my auto weekly buy for a random day then.\n\nThanks for the help, really appreciate it.": 4, "This doesn't really work, but it might not be obvious why.\n\nLet's assume the bitcoin price is a random walk. You've already determined that the random walk is skewed towards the positive axis. (otherwise, you wouldn't be buying) What is the optimal strategy in this model? Buy ASAP. The price tomorrow will be, on average, higher than the price today, it's always better to buy today than tomorrow.\n\nThe markets are not a random walk, and we can improve our strategy by buying on strategic time points. However, this requires us to come up with a model that will beat the market. Based on my research, this is nigh impossible and surely not achieved using a simple moving average.\n\nDollar cost averaging doesn't really work. It is, unless you've really extensive market knowledge, better to buy today than tomorrow. By extension, it is also better to buy today than spread over a year, although the latter scenario is less risky.": 3, "> Even if you think the general trend is up, you don't have to subscribe to theory that tomorrow will on the average be higher.\n> In that case, the general trend is not up. If the trend is up (which i arbitrary define here as 'higher price in X years'), the price tomorrow is (on average) higher than today.\n\nThe trend can be up over a larger periods (months, years) even if the typical trend from yesterday to today is more likely to be down. I find this to be true with bitcoin, long periods of downtrend and short but high bursts up.\n\nI've exploited this successfully in the past over the long periods. I'm not sure about the weekly though. This thread gave me a few ideas though, I'll see how they play out in practice.\n\nI agree that it's very hard to find anything non-random in price movement and even harder to exploit it. However, there are profitable long-term holders and there are profitable bitcoin traders and that alone is the evidence that price is at least somewhat predictable, isn't it? I believe it's still not too late to become profitable bitcoin holder, and trading is a skill that can be learned, although it's definitely not for everyone.": 1, "Dollar cost averaging like you're doing it is OK, but it assumes that you want to remove any price prediction from the equation (because you assume, correctly, that you can't predict the price). If you can make some educated guesses about the price, and you happen to be right, it can be improved upon.\n\nOne simple modification of dollar cost averaging might be to take 200-day moving average, and buy only when the price is below it - that way you bring your average price down by avoiding expensive buys, at the increased risk that you'll miss last chances to buy before big sustained upwards trends.\n\nBut we can do better than not buy bitcoins; the strategy above is not good for weekly buys as you'll go months without buying as it takes a long time for 200-day MA to move. Let's make the following assumptions instead:\n\n1. Bitcoin price is somewhat random each week (inside the larger trend).\n\n2. Bitcoin price tends to move in jumps of about $5-$10 as this is the kind of movement that daytraders are able to lock in some profit.\n\n3. We can bring up the weekly chart (where each candle is one week) and check how much price tends to move each week. Check the difference between the weekly high and weekly low (not the open and close). This tends to be about $10-$20 each week, although it's been $50, $75 or even $178 during the latest run up to $500. But let's assume $10-$20.\n\nNow, each week when you put the money in, do the following:\n\n1. Cancel all previous orders. Note the total amount of USD you have (cancelled orders + new deposit).\n\n2. Bid 1/2 of the money $10 below the current price (min weekly range).\n\n3. Bid 1/4 of the money $15 below the current price (mid point between min and max weekly range).\n\n4. Bid 1/4 of the money $20 below the current price (max weekly range).\n\nWhat this accomplishes is that you're not paying the spread by using market order. Also, you become market maker instead of market taker - at most of the exchanges this means you pay less fees. And the most important thing is that you catch the dips, thus bringing your average cost per bitcoin down. Of course, this is just a general idea. You can tweak the distance below the current price you're willing to go, or you can split the money differently (1/2, 1/4, 2x1/8), or even try using trailing stop instead of limit order as the original strategy might fail during the uptrend.\n\nOf course, obligatory disclaimer - I just whipped this up, I haven't backtested this, I'm not a financial advisor, and maybe it's all around bad idea. Also, you shouldn't follow financial advice you find on the Internet. But I hope it gives you some ideas how to build your own strategy.": 6, "I still don't understand your argument, could you please elaborate? Even if you think the general trend is up, you don't have to subscribe to theory that tomorrow will on the average be higher. On the contrary, the price on average might be (slightly) lower, but sometimes significantly higher. I think there was even study that found out that markets spend most of the time slowly bleeding downwards.\n\nI do however agree that the system I sketched above tends to perform badly compared to buying as soon as possible when the market is in the uptrend - but even then it should somehow minimize the risk by catching retracements.": 1, "You make it sound like the trend is a strong indicator of future price movements. My research claims otherwise whatever your definition of trend is (i tried many).\n\nThere are profitable and unprofitable bitcoin traders, that's true. In my opinion, profitable or not profitable is mostly a matter of luck. Even though the strategy might've worked for you, that doesn't indicate that it's better than buy & hold on average. Even if the random walk hypothesis was completely true, there is still a near-50% fraction of the market that is profitable.\n\nI consider myself a successful, if not the most successful bitcoin trader, in this subreddit (i went from 0.1 LTC to a bit under 70 BTC in the last 2 years).

No one really knows how the halving should be priced in even if we all have some idea that it should have a positive effect on the price.\n\nHumans think linearly. Maybe the average bitcoiner thinks that the halving should mean a doubling in price. The price has doubled from 220-230 so now we might think the halving is priced in. In reality, the relationship between the halving and the effect on demand could be far from linear. Or maybe the rise from 220-230 wasn't caused by market participants pricing in the halving but from actual economic activity. In that case, then we may be under a collective illusion that we've priced it in while we've actually done nothing at all.\n\nI don't know how the halving should be priced, but I'm willing to bet that however we price it, we're going to be *wrong* and there will be volatility as we adjust.

So, in the event of a Bitcoin bubble, if ethbtc would also go up because (if) it has bottomed and it was going to go up anyway, that implies that the real value of eth would combine the growth of btc value plus the growth of eth value.\n\nSo if eth goes from 0.002 btc to 0.006 btc (which is just the first target suggested by TA, and it's 300%!), and in the meantime Btc goes from 400 to 800, then by being in the ethbtc pair, you've captured **both** rallies, making 6x profit rather than 'just' the 2x that you would have made if you hold btc.\n\nIt could also be that btc rallies and eth stays at the same level, in which case theres no big problem or loss in value, because holding ethbtc means you can sell the eth for as many btc as you bought it for in the first place.\n\nThe risk is that ethbtc goes down more... but frankly the chart suggests there is now plenty more room for it to go up than to go down. I really think chances are eth will outperform btc this year, given that, on top of bullish TA, there are two very bullish events lined up and not priced in yet: the realease of Homestead (which to me should have an effect similar to the halving), and the switch to PoS, which changes the economics of mining more dramatically that ten halvings put together.": 3, "I flipped a coin for you, /u/tamnoswal The result was: tails\n***\n^^Don't ^^want ^^me ^^replying ^^on ^^your ^^comments ^^again? ^^Respond ^^to ^^this ^^comment ^^with ^^'leave ^^me ^^alone'": 6, "I'm skeptical of every rise and every fall, and I take nothing for granted when it comes to btc.
