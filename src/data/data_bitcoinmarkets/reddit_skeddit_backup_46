I would come back with at least two answers:\n\n1) a BTCChina that opens ATMs owned by BTCChina as little shops, like maybe mobile phone shops - partner with them - which sell phones, help you install a mobile wallet, and buy and import BTC to the phone, and help you get going on an exchange, and could have little "BTC prepaid" sheets - where someone buys a fraction of BTC with RMB (cash in hand) and then calls to activate the BTC prepaid sheet - like maybe it\'s a BIP0038 protected sheet with um only digits for a passphrase, maybe 30 digits or so, same as cash but with an expiration date like a year out. Just use a normal printer to print these out. No biggy.\n\n2) a BTCChinaOffshore - find a friendly place, Netherlands? Canada?

Could do that with fees. Like if too much is flowing out, the outflow fee is 1%, 2%, 3%, 10%, whatever it takes to get it under control. Unless the value is less than whatever the renminbi limits are per person? Have a way to help people know those limits.

Both of these are incredibly common mistakes. No reason to feel bad about it at all.\n\nI bought two times, both during previous supports for the market. The first support failed, so I bailed on that support and waited for the next one. I purchased at that next support level (475) and waited for that to fail - when it didn\'t fail, and we bounced back, even with a high volume of trades, I think it was reasonable to say that it was a stable point and that the market would rebound from there. Of course it could have simply moved sideways and did nothing, but if that was the case then I would sell if my support failed again.\n\nI think the fall sell was reasonable - we\'d just failed to clear $1,250 twice, and then there was a ton of bad news from China.

This high fluctuation due to how new it is makes it so that day trading is straight up gambling since you can't really use any methods of prediction.\n\nThe real future of bitcoin is going to be decided by the few people who hold ridiculously large amounts of bitcoins.  12 million bitcoins have been mined.

Therefor the more it goes down tons and quickly the less risk there is. Likewise, if the market goes down a decent amount (like this week) it may not rebound. It may continue in the same direction.

So I thought ok, my company will operate in just one state to start, and then if we grow we can expand our operations as well as our registrations.  \nOn the federal level, things are pretty clear cut, registration with FinCEN is most likely necessary for any business that deals with USD/BTC exchanges (After reading about what happened to Mike Caldwell and his Casascius coins, his business never touched a USD but he still got a nastygram from FinCEN I'm very confused about that, since one of my initial contacts at FinCEN was unsure that I was going to need to register with them at all since I don't plan to operate an exchange per se, however we decided it would be best to just go all out with the compliance and do it.)  The state level is a much different game, the problem here is that 90% of the time the regulators have either not heard of Bitcoin, and certainly never licensed a Bitcoin business before.  I personally have experience in 2 states, Illinois and Massachusetts, Since bitcoin fails to qualify as a currency under either state's definitions, the informal responses I've received from state regulators is that most likely we will not need to register for a state level MSB license. Again, however, my company has decided to go all out on compliance and do everything we may be required to do now, and also what we may need to do in the coming months as regulations become more standardized.  Finally the biggest hurdle in the US for operating an exchange or exchange type business is finding a banking partner who can provide MSB banking services to your business.  The MSB bank partner is hard to find because providing MSB banking services requires extensive ongoing auditing and permanent compliance officers dedicated to the company, this is obviously far more complex than walking into the business office at Citibank and opening a commercial account for your retail store, and why most banks that offer such services are very turned off to the liability that overseeing a Bitcoin business entails.": 5, 'Would that work?

First of all it can\'t be gamed. Second of all bitcoin exploits human greed by encouraging sell offs when the price gets "too high". Remember that these people are still stuck in the dollar paradigm. The wealth effect encourages consumption as it does with fiat. The difference however is that you can never get coin back for less than you sold it for and it\'s much harder if not impossible to collect interest on coins. Most fiat interest is generated by money printing. Coins generate their "own" interest via deflation but so do the ones you trade. The net effect is far more even distribution of wealth. In this way *everyone* benefits from the "interest" effect of deflation. \n\nThe rich can only get proportionally rich, not exponentially. Their *numerical* coln holdings can\'t increase simply by arbitrage "investment". If they want more coins they\'re going to have to trade something of tangible market value in return. If not every time they spend (and they will, even the rich have to eat) they will have less coin and thus less wealth over the long term. \n\nThe last point is important because bitcoins value against fiat will not rise forever. Equilibrium will eventually be reached and their value will be steady and not arbitrarily judged against a single asset. That is one bitcoin will be worth one bitcoin, no more, no less and *all* prices will permanently stabilize. Yes it will take a long time to reach this point (if it ever does) but the market will have no choice in the mater just as the people never had a choice in using centralized currency until now.

Of course they still hold keys to the fiat banking structure that they will be charging the new kids for access to it. Banks can play nice and make a *little* money but by doing so they put themselves out of business over the longer term or are forced to really compete. \n\nWe see this now with services like OKpay cards.

OTC is easier if a bitcoin millionaire shows up and says - "Goldman Sachs, I have 5000 BTC. Can you take this off my hands at a spot price, 5% under today\'s market price? I want to go on a vacation from life now." Goldman Sachs would handle the rest.\n\n* Next, bitcoin as a currency, for that, Wall Street has to ask itself, can we save the money transfer systems like Western Union, ACH, SWIFT, or are they done? Pick a side, and go. Pitch some plans to help those companies adapt, or fund a competitor. This is where the VCs and angel investors that did things like Coinbase and Bitpay find the exits - they go public, Wall Street organizes IPOs or takes and keeps them private.\n\n* More advanced - Wall Street thinks up new companies and exchanges and gets in that way.

I\'ve heard that BTC-e already allows MetaTrader 4 software to connect to it, so surely some at-home investors are going to get in next. \n\n\nWall Street will come.

Not just for bullish speculators that own BTC as a commodity and hope that the price goes up - but so that more and more funds would have to take a look.

What I\'m getting at is that in the case of an ETF trading stocks on a bourse - and one could argue this is similar to what may have happened with Gold - the valuation of the shares of the ETF becomes decoupled from the ownership of the underlying "commodity" (BTC). In this case the shares become a proxy for the BTC and anyone can buy them, without having to deal with the actual security problems posed by wallets and all that. The ETF trades differently from the underlying asset, and as a result the value of the underlying asset becomes a reflection of the ETF and not any particular valuation for the asset. Maybe this doesn\'t matter because valuation is valuation is valuation. Wall Street would love to sell ETF shares to people, and plenty of folks would love to trade options against such an instrument. \n\nSo, anyhow, I\'ll be very interested in how the ETFs will reveal their BTC ownership.

Then it crashes back down, leveling to a level a bit higher than the previous flat period. Then we enter a few more months of flat prices, at which point we get to the next cycle.  \nThat's happened twice so far, and what's happening now seems on track to be a third occurrence.\n\nSo, if that's correct, we can expect prices to go significantly lower than they are now, then dwell there for several months before another cycle starts. The last flat period had the price hovering around $100, so let's spitball it and say we might hover around $200 this time around, with occasional dips below that.\n\nThat's what I think is happening. Now how to deal with it:\n\nFirst, you need to decide if you're in or out. If you don't believe my little cyclical pet theory, or don't think the price is going to ever rebound, you're out. Cash out your chips, I hear the S&P500 is lovely this time of year.\n\nIf you're in, you want an approach where you buy low and sell high. The easiest way to do that without a crystal ball is to rebalance your bitcoin assets consistently. Pick some USD amount of bitcoin you want to own. Say, $1,000. Now, check what your bitcoins are worth. If they're worth less than $1000, buy more. If they're worth more than $1000, sell the extra. Do that regularly. You don't need to time the tops or the bottoms, just rebalance consistently, and you'll get a better price average and profit taking than most.\n\n(And yes, you could decide rebalancing is for chumps, and wait for the $200 I promised to buy, but I did say I was spitballing it. Who knows what the price will actually reach. I'm only predicting a general chart shape here. Stick to rebalancing. It's easy and boring, and it works well with crazy volatile assets. )\n\n": 4, "And certainly don't take loans to make investments.

You don\'t have to be sitting at your computer trying to get timing right in the face of network and exchange latency, the exchange will automatically use your funds to buy you coins if your conditions are met.\n\nLikewise, a sell order means "sell if the price hits X or higher." If you\'re trying to make a lot of money off of volatility, you really want at least one of each, so that you make stable fiat off the highs, and you automatically reinvest during the lows. I say "at least one of each", because this is also good to combine with the multiple-orders strategy, where you have an order every $50 or so (for example, if the current price is $600, you set a buy order each at $550, $500, and $450, to really catch those lows if/when they happen).\n\nTo the best of my knowledge, Coinbase does not support these kind of conditional orders, but they are the best way to make short-term dough on the markets while increasing the liquidity and stability of the price of BTC.': 8, "I honestly don't know.

This effectively means that **it pays anybody who buys into it** (also increasing the price, increasing interest and uptake: LOOP).  \n- Bitcoin is all things to all men, and presents something **desirable at every stage of it\'s uptake**. This is an important trait of an emerging technology. Just like evolution, it must be a benefit, or at least not a hinderance. 1) miners 2) speculators 3) currency 4) government + control. [ignore the last one if it annoys you].  \n- Bitcoin is **not yet a natural currency**. It\'s an investment/speculation toy. We can work around all the problems now, but in time it will stabilise. (higher prices = less volatility [the percentage change is less]). Of side note, I think a financial system based on a deflationary currency might actually be spectacularly better than an inflationary one, despite the fears. BECAUSE it self-stabilises in maturity. **Volatile in infancy, stable in maturity**. Inflationary systems seem the opposite. Hence their current "why\'s everything so fucked?" phase.  \n  \nSo - right now you\'re dealing with a \'store of wealth\'.

What happens if the power cuts out? You\'d lose everyone\'s wallets. That\'s what a database is for.

I want you to think about that for a few minutes. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s right for me\xe2\x80\x9d.  So, whatever makes my life better, according to me, is \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d. Morally right. There\xe2\x80\x99s a whole generation of young people out there who have this code. A whole generation. They\xe2\x80\x99re flooded with information, their view is, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, well, you have requirements, but they\xe2\x80\x99re sort of your thing, and I have to meet them, but, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to meet them however is best for me. And all your rules, I don\xe2\x80\x99t really care about your rules, because, they don\xe2\x80\x99t really apply to me. So, that\xe2\x80\x99s how I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna be\xe2\x80\x9d.\nNow, you think about what it would be like, if that moral code, that is in a lot of what I would call \xe2\x80\x9cthe rising generation\xe2\x80\x9d in the world, you take that moral code and imagine that\xe2\x80\x99s the code that is in the population, that\xe2\x80\x99s the code that starts getting into people who run organisations. Well I guarantee you if that happens, the economy that you saw recently in the 2007, 2008, 2009 period will be a cake-walk compared to what will happen if that code takes over.\nThat means everybody, every leader, every person with any interest in healthy, functioning, growing economy, has a responsibility to counter-act the above moral code. Whether you\xe2\x80\x99re a teacher, a leader, in a firm, in a home, wherever you are, in families, organisations \xe2\x80\x93 you need to recognise where it pops up, and you need to teach.

You can start by helping them see, by that having that point of view and moral code; they are headed to sure personal disaster, because they are, because no one will trust them. No-one will believe anything they say. Including people who they want to believe them. That code destroys human relationships, destroys organisations, destroys families \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s a sure recipe for disaster, because it\xe2\x80\x99s very short sighted. And you can start there by teaching them that it\xe2\x80\x99s in their interest to tell the truth. To care about how other people feel. To think about the consequences two or three steps down of their behaviour. All of us have that responsibility.

I'll try to address your comments.\n\nHorizon 1:\nYou're right that Bitcoin does have a core, and you listed what it contains. The problem is that this core is well-understood only in communities such as /r/bitcoinmarkets. It is clear from the media coverage on Bitcoin that there is a large confusion as to what Bitcoin is and how it has functions aside from an anonymous payment system for drugs. Therefore, the first horizon is to educate the media (and in doing so, the governments) as to what Bitcoin's core is.\n\nHorizon 2:\nPaypal and Western Union are certainly competitors to Bitcoin in the remittance arena, but they are also the incumbents. While Bitcoin offers functionality that the incumbents can't match, they are not simply going to roll over. They can put a lot of friction and bad will in front of Bitcoin, which would seriously hamper its growth. A better strategy during this growth phase is to partner with incumbents so as to leverage their already-existing infrastructure as a means to continue growth.\n\nHorizon 3:\nThis section is meant for more far-off ideas that could become part of Bitcoin's value drivers in the future.

As far as this presentation goes I disagree with some points.\n\nHorizon 1:\n\nWhat do you mean in specific with define and stabilize Bitcoin's core?\nBitcoin has a defined core. It's a technology that allows verified, neutral, instant, cheap, safe transactions of value worldwide without a central party. If you limit the core to less features so that governments can regulate it easier, you might kill Bitcoin. Bitcoin does not rely on government acceptance but on people acceptance. Some Governments might be able to outlaw it but they can not kill it. Democratic governments will need to accept and adapt to the new reality.\n\nHorizon 2:\n\n(This seems like a contradiction to Horizon 1. In 1 you want to define and stabilize the core. Here you want to increase the functions of Bitcoin.) A decentralized exchange sounds really promising! How would this work with fiat currencies? \n\nPaypal and Western Union. Those are direct competitors to Bitcoin. They provide the same service bitcoin does. They verify money transactions as their main function and natuarly price their job. With Bitcoin, those services are no longer needed. We should avoid any coorperation with them as the goal they would follow would be to monetize Bitcoin transactions. \n\nPage 28. All of those are the exact opposite of companies that can provide a useful to Bitcoin and to users service. If Bitcoin succeeds their overall profit will be much lower and they know that. In that case they will die. They might adapt to payment-exchange-processors like Bitpay or Coinbase in the short term, which would ultimately only decrase their lifespan as those kind of companies will also not be needed in the foreseeable future (again: only if Bitcoin succeeds).\n\nHorizon 3:\n\nGood Points.\n\n\nThanks for sharing your presentation.

Something about that just rubs me the wrong way.": 1, 'Fair enough - I think if presented to a client there would certainly be questions about the recommendations, which is where the meat is. \n\nI was hoping to spark some discussion on the future of Bitcoin from the perspective of a well-run organization. Certainly that will give the feel that I am treating Bitcoin as a business, which is incongruent with its decentralized nature. However, I would argue that in order for Bitcoin to continue its growth at the pace that it has seen, a unified effort to endorse its values should be undertaken.': 2, 'Absolutely - I see the inclusive approach, where partnerships with current industry leaders can help Bitcoin to maintain its growth.\n\nCertainly Bitcoin is a disruptive technology that has the potential to displace the incumbents, but I believe that having this as a first-order strategy will lead to quite a bit of friction and competition from these very large players.\n\nAs to your link, I feel that filing patents may not be very fruitful. The value in a patent is the government-granted monopoly to stop other organizations from using your innovation. This is only valuable if there is an organization to sue in the case of infringement. However, with the case of Bitcoin, there is no such organization, making the patents less useful. I saw a similar news article on how JP Morgan filed a patent for a Bitcoin-like cryptocurrency system. I believe (and please correct me if I am wrong) that this patent was thrown out by the USPTO. \n\nThe biggest threat to Bitcoin that I see currently is that of governments banning the use of Bitcoin entirely. Truth be told (and I am no fortune teller) I wrote this presentation before China disallowed BTCChina from accepting yuan deposits, and this is exactly the type of major disruption that I see as an obstacle that Bitcoin will face time and time again.\n\nI see the immediate action item for Bitcoin as a strong effort to present to the media what Bitcoin really is. I see a lot of reports by Bloomberg, FT, and WSJ dismissing Bitcoin due to its use in illicit activities. If Bitcoin can distance itself from such activities by presenting itself to the media as what it truly is (a monetary instrument), then I can see Bitcoin receiving a more favorable reception by governments, wall street, and the public.': 4, "Converting fiat to btc and back is currently expensive and time consuming. The fees range from 0.2% to 0.5% for the exchange transaction, plus the cost of a wire to get your fiat off the exchange (~$50). \n\nIt is for this reason that Bitcoin's value driver of reducing forex fees will be tough to realize before Bitcoin is used more often as a unit of account. Once this happens, businesses accepting Bitcoin will no longer have to exchange it for fiat to pay their suppliers, because their suppliers will also accept it.\n\nWhat is your field, if I may ask?": 2, 'I would like to point out that this thought is not of my origin but I really like it too.

Great stuff!": 4, "Money doesn't corrupt absolutely.  Power granted via authority over liberty corrupts absolutely.\n\nPlayers on Wall Street did not cause - by themselves - the financial instability that we see.  Government control enabled the bankers and other financial institutions to make terrible economic decisions (like sub-prime mortgages) due to the Federal government making it illegal to discriminate against the economically poor.  In fact, there was a great incentive made by two semi-Federal institutions, Fannie-May and Freddie-Mac.  These sub-prime mortgages were being covered by these two, which allowed primary lenders to remove themselves from any risk made.\n\nThat resulted in risk being diluted and shared between the largest institutions.  Those at the top understood the coupling between the big banks well and most likely knew that this would force the Federal government to bail them out when it all came crashing down.\n\nGovernments around the world cause the issues that we currently face.  The nationalistic values that people from prior generations (even many in current generations) hold perpetuate the issues rather than allow them to die as they should.  I am a fervent proponent of voluntarism to the point that people should be free to choose if and how they themselves are governed.  Should people so choose, they can choose to be completely free of all government authority without facing penalty. ": 2, 'Okay, after watching the video, let me amend my comment above because I did not get the correct meaning of Prof. Clark\'s speech. I thought he was saying he knew of a new generation of young people with a better moral code. What I now think he was saying is almost the opposite: if the next generation has a "What\xe2\x80\x99s right for me, is right" attitude then the future will be far worse than the 2007-9 economic slump.\n\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting video which I assume was produced more as PR exercise for the general public than as an academic lesson. They seemed to give good basic advice about how being selfish may not serve one\xe2\x80\x99s long-term interest, but it was not earth shattering stuff to me. The moral being that life might well be a lot more fun, and more profitable, being more like Richard Branson, than, say, Donald Trump.\n\nHowever, I was hoping that they might have given a number of examples of the difficult moral decisions that various businessmen had struggled with, because the must be many. The only one I got was a rather vague thing about the president of Alcoa wanting to drive down the fatality and injury rate in his aluminum smelting plants to zero, which does not sound possible.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know about the guy concerned but I bet he had ethical decisions that were far harder than this. \n\nI also heard a lot about how tough it is to be head of Harvard Business School. At this point the cynic in me took over and was saying: Yes, it must be really hard to find a place to put all money that keeps arriving.  However I think the real issue was a little hidden message when Prof. Clark, was talking about the consequences of trying to \xe2\x80\x9cmanipulate\xe2\x80\x9d a company\xe2\x80\x99s accounting standards to their advantage (1:38:15). This he says will cause the whole system to collapse, which with then lead to regulation and the two big problems with regulation is that they lead corruption (I thought it did the opposite) and higher costs. Now he sounds like a normal business man: I\xe2\x80\x99m good, but don\xe2\x80\x99t try and regulate me or you will regret it. This is exactly the message we have been getting from the banks. Just to push the point home he then says, exactly this happened in Nazi Germany, but he is sorry there is not more time so he can explain further.\n\nI know I\xe2\x80\x99m generally too cynical, but I did end up wondering if the whole lecture was actually a little test. If they caught any alumni acting on anything they heard that day everyone would know to stay well clear of anything they were involved with. \n\n': 2, "I was kind of with you there until we got to the 70 year-olds :-)\n\nI'm not quite that old, but I am a boomer, and I do actually have quite a bit of sympathy for the mess I suspect we are leaving the next generation. \n\nBut I think you are kidding yourself if you think the ethics of the next generation will be any better. This is the mistake that has constantly been made with the so called war on drugs: money corrupts absolutely, and if you have enough you can always find and buy off whatever number of police, judges, DEA agents you need etc. This is not to say they are all corrupt, I think it is mostly the opposite in the case of the US, but there are always weak links and they are not hard to find if you have the money. The real corruption, the one that unlike drugs really matters, is that which we allowed to occur in the Reagan/Bush1/Clinton years when we allowed Wall St. to do whatever they liked.  This will always occur if we let it, and same kind of people will participate whether they happen to be 70 of 17.

So we're heading in a good direction.\n\nWhat I've observed with some of the alts is that their playful nature has serendipitously provided a way to teach people about the redefined notion of currency (ie how it can be much more than the traditional view of money). I'm satisfied that these alts (ie dogecoin) will allow the idea of a cryptocurrency to permeate through society much deeper than if the task was relegated to the media. These alts allow the public to play with currency, and discover how different cryptos can be from what they've known before. And that opens them to the idea of bitcoin, which they can go forth and use responsibly as a new financial instrument.\n\nIn other words, the alts help society **safely** understand the concept of bitcoin. The media involvement is good, and corporate integration is better, but people need to abandon their old views of currency, and these alts help with that.": 2, "I don't think its volatility erodes away its utility. It just creates business opportunities around it. See Bitstamp.

Eventually when Bitcoin stabalises, Bitstamp won't be as useful anymore.": 1, 'One of the things that will be required for the future growth of Bitcoin is the reshaping of the idea of "currency". And one of the potential vectors for accomplishing this cultural shift is through the phenomena of "currency as a toy".\n\nWe have already witnessed one example of this phenomena in action just recently with the shocking adoption of Dogecoin (a joke that unintentionally taught people about cryptocurrencies). The stunning aspect of this is that the demographic that flocked to Dogecoin was the very people who had found the idea of bitcoin unpalatable (this statement is based on the mutual animosity that can be observed in bitcoin forums towards Dogecoin, and vice versa).\n\nFrom what we can gather, the demographic that adopted Dogecoin did so with the intention to use the technology as a toy, rather than as a serious instrument for financial purposes. This is the first time in human history that a group of people are treating a currency as a play thing (note that this is different than "playing with money"). It\'s a development that will likely have some academic implications, as it demonstrates that society is losing its reverence towards the idea of currency, and that the idea is being opened up to examination in a way that never existed before.\n\nFrom this development we can predict many more "memecoins" in the future, as well as social innovations and critiques that come in the form of a currency. It indicates that a new vector has been created for educating society about the functions and possibilities of financial instruments in a way that\'s non-abstract; people can now treat currency as a toy instead of as a serious instrument, and through the act of play they can learn its fundamentals.\n\nIt should also be noted that this development of "currency as a toy" is diametrically opposed to the goals of China in maintaining their society\'s views of what a "true" currency is. This represents a clear war of ideas between nation states like China and those that seek to redefine money.\n\nThus I would argue that the propagation of currencies that are treated as toys has major implications for the way society will view money in the future, and therefor also for the future growth of bitcoin.': 3}, ('Heavy support at $500.

If you send it before one day, then the bitcoin-qt client will never include the transaction in the next block unless you add a transaction fee.\n\nIn a second scenario, if you receive a transaction containing 0.05 bitcoins into an empty wallet, then you cannot spend any of the money from the receive wallet for 20 days, unless you add a transaction fee.  The number of bitcoin days destroyed is the amount of the input times the number of days it has been in the wallet.\n\nIn a final scenario, if you create a wallet which receives two separate input transactions, each for 0.05 bitcoins, then you must wait 20 days to spend the inputs without any fee.  Even though there are 0.1 bitcoins in the wallet, the transaction to spend all the wallet\'s bitcoins will have two inputs, which means it takes more network bandwidth and disk space.

The fact that few people had even heard of Bitcoin, and even fewer understood it, only added to the sexiness of the story and sense of possibilities for the future.  Now that the price has been stagnant for a couple of weeks, and the novelty has worn off, the tone of the media coverage has taken a much more sober, and often negative turn.  Reporters and pundits are now talking much more about the potential dangers and downsides of Bitcoin, both for society as a whole, and for investors who, it's either implied or stated outright, are buying into a potential house of cards, which could collapse at any time.  The dotcom and housing busts, both of which are in recent memory, serve as excellent templates for and examples of what could happen to Bitcoin and more and more people are making the obvious comparisons.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, and barring some amazingly good news, or a large infusion of new money into the market, neither of which I expect in the short term, it's unlikely that the price will recover significantly anytime soon.  However, given the quick rebounds from the two flash crashes in the past two weeks, the market has at least learned one lesson, and so there isn't likely to be another sudden plunge from panic selling.  Instead, we're more likely to see a long slow slide to whatever the bottom ends up being.  As the price slowly drifts downwards, more and more people who bought in during the euphoria that drove the price up above $1,200, and who've been holding out hoping the price will go back up to something closer to (or even above) what they bought in at, will continue to get more and more nervous and want to just get whatever money they have left in the market out before it collapses entirely.  As a result, I see the price declining significantly in the near term.  \n\nThe good news is that Bitcoin does still have incredible long-term potential, and after the story dies down, public interest moves on to other subjects, and people start to forget about the recent crash, there's a very good chance that the cycle will start all over again six to twelve months down the road.  In the meantime, Bitcoin adoption will quietly increase, innovation will continue and eventually some piece of news will pop up that refocuses public attention on it.  After some time goes by, people who are too fearful to jump into the market now will have forgotten their fear, but will remember the envy they felt from reading about ordinary chumps who made millions investing in Bitcoin and the mania to get in on it and try to make some money for themselves will seem irresistible again.\n\nOf course, there's also a chance that before any of that happens some large government or governments, get wise to the threat posed by Bitcoin and take steps to wall it off from the global banking system entirely, in which case we're all SOL.  While I think that's a distinct possibility, I think that we're at the point now where enough people with money and clout are invested in Bitcoin so that, unlike, say, two years ago, it's not completely at the mercy of established interests.

Then, unless there is a big news story, price will slowly decline through the weekend, but still receive strong support around $800 to keep it pointed more towards $900 than $700.

Now people who bought "the internet money" to get rich are just hoping to sell it without loss or with small. Every day bitcoin is negative they\'re getting more desperate.\n\nI\'m highly skeptical of the notion that the market is full of commonfolk who don\'t have a clue about Bitcoin and the reasons of its volatility, and are thus willing to jump out on the first sign of trouble. I\'m quite sure there\'s a good number of them, but they don\'t have the volume needed to do much damage. People who don\'t understand Bitcoin or are in it to get rich quick most likely *aren\'t* rich yet. It follows that they don\'t own hundreds of coins and are trading in what\'s petty change to your average whale.\n\nFirst off, the charts clearly show this. The volume is now very low. People are holding. If they\'re cashing out, it\'s with very small amounts - and this can be readily explained by merchants transferring their BTC income into fiat through the use of Bitpay and the like. Looking at the charts, I\'m not feeling despair or panic at all. I\'m feeling bearishness, I\'m seeing the price slowly deflating from what even the sensible bull had to realize is an overvalued bubble that cannot be sustained by the adoption rate of Bitcoin (again, merchants are predominantly cashing out their BTC earnings instead of circling them back to the economy, which deflates the price). \n\nDropping down to the all-time mean would mean dropping as low as 400-500 USD per coin, and that would still be *good*. It would show maturity and reliability.\n\nThe second reason why I believe the market is not full of scared noobs is because it\'s hard to get Bitcoin. You can\'t just hear about it from the news and buy in tomorrow. You need some technical skill, some education and a lot of effort. This is still a predominantly nerd market, and the process of getting into it is a process of learning a thing or two about what to expect.\n\nHowever, I do agree with this:\n\n> I think that a big fall is going to happen\n\nJust not for the same reasons as you. My notion of why the price is deflating is simply the fact that it is not realistic. There\'s little ways you can use all that expensive coin, and the Bitcoin economy is currently, by nature, one heavily reliant on fiat because that\'s what merchants pay their bills with. \n\nWithout new people getting in, which is unlikely to happen during the holidays when people are spending fiat, money used for transactions will simply have to flow out of the system until the value drops to the price set by the buy&holders - the value of *Bitcoin the value store*, not Bitcoin the currency.\n\nThat\'s my 2 bitcents, anyway.': 10, "there are still people here who refute the 'weekend dip' observation.  blows my mind.

When random buys and sells enter the market, the market price ping-pongs between 850 and 870 and it can be said to 'trade in a range'.\n\nEventually though, the usual case is that the market either runs out of resistance (not very many sellers...) or runs out of support (no more lines of waiting buyers) ... and the price starts to move.\n\nIt's my feeling for example that the market is pretty narrow on BTCChina with tight distances between bid/ask. Weird, with lots of support and resistance there. Other markets like bitstamp are wider, and the prices usually are able to move around pretty freely (and at a lot lower volume).\n\nAnyway, it's my opinion that Bollinger bands show that things are tightening up.

Marc was over the moon with excitement and among other things related that he would be announcing venture capital news soon - next day the $25mil  Coinbase investment was announced. He basically said that everyone he speaks to in the silicon valley VC world is excited about BTC and crypto currency and the money will/is flooding in.\n\nI posted a few other comments he made to the link below but unfortunately the video is for Yahoo internal use at this point.\n\n[reddit!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1skny1/yahoo_tech_pulse_marissa_mayer_marc_andreessen/)": 6, 'The time scales are arbitrary; it\'s true.\n\nBut perhaps the key part is "i am missing the point of this subreddit".  \n\n>What happens when bitcoin reaches maximum adoption and the price, by and large, stabilises? Will you still be long term bull, i.e. expecting the price to rise? \n\nWell that would obviously be more a function of the economy than bitcoin *per se*.  If bitcoin reaches \'maximum adoption\' then very likely bitcoin at some point will have become the thing with which dollars are measured against instead of vice-versa.  \n\nLong term bear would mean, presumably, that you think the the price from now will tend downward.  Perhaps to zero, perhaps to 9 dollars.. I don\'t know.  \n\nA range of arbitrary timescales would be better than 2; but to counter act your argument a bit.. where should one draw the line to fall in line "with the point of the subreddit".  I do expect a price drop; as it appears overbought; *BUT* the whole point is that you cannot gauge the market rate just on some static penetration like virtually (heh) every other commodity/stock/bond that we would have these types of conversations about.\n\nYour little projection about being a heathen is just silly.. it\'s more like "i think there is a 95% chance it will be below the current price right now at some point in the future and a 45% chance it will be 10x its current value within 2 years"  does that make me a bull or a bear?': 2, '> Tons of entities that have a vested interest in squashing Bitcoin\n\nI don\'t care much about conspiracy theories.\n\n> would have no problem dropping $400M to see it go away.\n\nThey would drop $400M to fake a couple of their own transactions to other people, after which it would be common knowledge to the network that those transactions have been faked. An analogy would be - they would spend $400M in order to give you a counterfeit dollar bill, and 10 minutes later you\'d be aware what they\'ve done.\n\nSo what? Imagining a scenario that would "squash Bitcoin" by invalidating a big enough number of transactions in order to make the network untrustable is truly a daunting thought experiment with an astronomical price tag.': 1, "> then you're going to see it coming and be able to jump ship. \n\nNot necessarily.

Slowly it may erode at bitcoin's market cap, but people will attribute this to any number of things... and the argument why bitcoin is the best and brightest will continue to be parroted.\n\nAt some point, bitcoin and its competitor will be comparable in terms of adoption, and people will debate which is likely to come out ahead in the long run.\n\nSure, it won't wreck bitcoin overnight. But being able to clearly identify bitcoin's heir may not be so obvious in advance. It's like a marathon... bitcoin may be ahead now, a competitor may be ahead in the 2nd leg of the competition, and its anyone's guess as to which will ultimately win the race.": 1, "I think the approach of having a coin that only requires a certain amount of computing power to 51% attack is severely risky and flawed.

They\'re very expensive, the supply is small, the performance difference between generations can be on an order of magnitude.  \nThat is going to change in a few years. Look at cpus. New cpus are not really faster than five year old cpus - over a dozen % at most.  \nEventually, new asics will only have small profit margins and old ones won\'t be significantly different - just a few percent difference in performance per watt.  \nIn other words, oversupply of older hardware and very small mining profit margins.  \n\nAt this point, obtaining or renting hardware is not going to be a problem. Renting - who wouldn\'t agree to "I will give you 30% more than what you would earn on your own"? Buying - the value of a relatively inefficient miner is zero, as it can never bring in a profit. So older asics - let\'s even say they require 2xtimes more energy per GH than new ones - are going to be very, very cheap. \n\nSo what\'s left is the cost of energy.  \nDaily mining cost is equivalent to all daily block rewards + transaction fees. It can\'t be lower because it means miners are losing money. It can\'t be significantly higher in a competitive market.  \nThat\'s a very small number now, about $4 million. Let\'s say you have inefficient asics, that\'s $8 million of your cost.  \n\nThat\'s definitely not impossible, especially if you can short bitcoins or buy put options on them (on a bitcoin ETF or something like that), you could even make big money on it.

As of right now, millions of people have heard about Bitcoin, while only a fraction of a percent actually own any.

There seems to be a wide-spread sense among a significant number of people that whatever Bitcoin\'s long-term potential is, in the mid-term there\'s a huge opportunity to make a boatload of money on it.  I fully expect these people to not only buy in with their own money, but to bring in a significant number of outside investors and pump the hell out of it.  These are people who understand finance, understand technology and know how to sell dreams.

Our investment increases monthly by $100, and also by this 10%. Using a quick [spreadsheet](http://i.imgur.com/vYcKmVW.png) we can see that in 42 months (3.5 years) we'd have $53k.\n\nWe're about 19 times below the estimate of 1 million, though. Change the number to 20% and [we barely hit 1 million](http://i.imgur.com/MV2fvPg.png). Ok, so we're expecting a 20% investment increase every month. Accordingly, if we just put $3600 in it now we would be at 1 million [in 32 months](http://i.imgur.com/mzQCgR8.png). So I guess saving 10 months isn't THAT big of a difference, but still, look at how drasticly different the value for 42 months is.\n\nAnother thing to consider is that, with a 20% return, your $100 investment becomes pointless after a while, diminishing returns, since you're already profiting so much..

': 1, "Wow, such transfer so market\n\nI was thinking the same thing as you so I tried to get an idea of how much money is transferred in a day worldwide. I'm assuming it will take a day on average (including lazy people) to complete a fiat-btc address-btc address-fiat transfer. If this is the case, then there needs to be enough bitcoin being actively converted to and from fiat in order to fill those outstanding orders (the outstanding orders being a day's worth of btc money transfers). I couldn't find a number for global money transferred per day, but this document: [this fincen document](http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/rp/files/Appendix_D.pdf) estimates the amount of interbank transfers through the three main current interbank transfer mechanisms at $8.5 trillion per day. If bitcoin captures 1% of that transfer volume (assuming an average transfer time from fiat to fiat of 1 day) that's an $85 billion market cap for LIQUID bitcoins. Assuming there will be 10 million LIQUID bitcoins (not lost or hoarded or saved) each of those would have to cost $8500 to fill the transfer orders.\n\nSo let's list the assumptions I've made there:\n\n10 million liquid bitcoins which can be readily converted to and from cash (if this number were less, butcoin price would be higher)\n\n1 day average to go from fiat to bitcoin to fiat (if this number were less, bitcoin price would be less)\n\n1% of the three main interbank transfer mechanisms used by banks today is replaced by bitcoins. This would be either bank adoption of bitcoin or people using bitcoin to transfer instead of using banks to manage money. (If this number were higher, bitcoin value would be higher).\n\nIf those conditions exist, each bitcoin would need a value of $8500 dollars to act as a transfer mechanism during an average day.\n\nThat took me about 45 minutes to type out. Long story short, even if it's just a transfer mechanism, everyone is moonbound. We'll be chasing that damned dogecoin there.

The funds invested in bitcoin will also take large chunks of coin out of circulation.  The more people who have coins and the more wallets that are made the more coins will be lost, reducing supply.  Our price bubbles are speculative but not unimportant.

From the language used in the advisory, I think this whole affair is about re-educating people about "true currency" and "good investments". China has always been very active in policing revolutionary thoughts and ideas, and bitcoin fits that profile. Hardliners and conservatives in the government may have decided that these new bitcoin enthusiasts have the wrong idea about currency and proper investments, and thus this is their way of enforcing the proper way of thinking. Bitcoin isn\'t illegal (which they\'ve said), but rather it\'s the practice of spending all your money on bitcoin that\'s the problem. So here we have the government forcing their citizens to not spend all their money on bitcoin.

This is ridiculous, of course, because it ignores the similarity of BTC to cash.  If people wanted more consumer-protection and the fees and regulations that go with it, they can build more credit cards or paypals.  Instead, BTC created a cash-like commodity, for those who prefer a deflationary global currency, that is NOT controlled by any gov\'t. (ya hear me CoinValidation?)\n\nAs for the concern of crime and laundering with BTC, the blockchain is better than the Dollar.  The US $100 bill is involved in more crime than any other type of currency on earth.  It is accepted damn-near globally as de facto global tender (the US should be happy that BTC could distract criminals away from its cash being used for international crime).  \n\nThe dope dealer on the street corner doesn\'t take checks or credit cards - you need cash to buy drugs. (Or, in some cases, steaks and laundry detergent work, too)  When the Fed wants more money, it prints more cash.  When N. Korea wants more money, they print the best counterfeit US $100 bills on the planet.  Despite these problems with the dollar that cannot be fixed, it is not going anywhere.  This is because cash provides an essential function  to society.\n\nWhenever the CoinValidation argument arises, just remind the people that once BTC stabilizes as a currency it will be more similar to cash than anything else.  And cash CANNOT have CoinValidation, for it would completely invalidate the purpose of cash (which is a means of payment no mater where it came from, who holds it, past or present, no matter its use). It is always perfectly liquid.\n\nThere is plenty of caselaw (the first notable case came out of Scotland way back in 1749, [Crawford v. the Royal Bank](http://www.dgcmagazine.com/what-a-landmark-legal-case-from-mid-1700s-scotland-tells-us-about-the-fungibility-and-the-very-nature-of-money-and-why-we-should-care-in-light-of-the-recent-coinvalidation-controversy/) about the importance of not interfering with the transfer of cash, nor establishing any sort of record of title which would encumber its transfer.  \n\nIf I get some cash in a good-faith bona fide transaction, that cash is mine.  It does not matter that 5 years ago a cocaine smuggler was paid with a few of the notes I now have;  nor if we can determine that the cash I have now was once owned by somebody else who was robbed - even though he can show that the notes have the same serial number.  The guy who got robbed can\'t get his cash back (unless it is still in the possession of the burglar when he is caught and the cash has not entered the stream of commerce through bona fide purchases/uses).\n\nBTC cannot be improved by CoinValidation, or black or whitelists.  We need to fight CoinValidation at every step of the way.  The blockchain provides more protection than cash already - we don\'t need more.': 4, "Thanks :)\n\nIt's bold in spirit. :)": 23, 'I believe your interpretation is correct. \n\nOne question I have though is will people be able to deposit money through online banking, or will they have to physically go to the bank and transfer the money in person.': 2, "I agree, philosophers are totally useless.

It does not require login, buying and selling BTC there is via AUD deposit to an account at NAB, Westpac, Commonwealth Bank and Bankwest, or to any bank in the case of sell orders. You specify your wallet address and have to deposit within 4 hours of the order for buy, or transfer BTC within 15 minutes for sell. I haven't used them for a while for buying so I don't know how long it takes to get your coins, but selling definitely takes a good week in most cases. I consider them the nuclear option as their price lags by quite a bit and is generally a bit less favourable than the other exchange services. In the case of a crash you might be lucky that you can still offload coins if you want to, at a bit of a higher rate than elsewhere with more dynamic pricing. In the case of buying, you're unfortunately pretty much restricted to bank opening times, as you have to deposit in cash right there.\n\nCoinjar is both a wallet service and a trading service, you can have money deposited there in AUD and keep BTC and trade at 2% buy, 1.1% sell fees. It works by deposit of AUD to a NAB account in cash, or also via electronic bank transfer upon verification (takes about just under a week). They have a funny staggered system of daily deposits, new users can only deposit $500 a day for the first 7 days, after that it's $2000 with +200$ with every deposit until it reaches $5000 ($10000 with verification). You can bypass that staggering by making lots of small deposits until you reach the limit you want. The deposit is usually cleared in 30 minutes, buying and selling works instantaneous now (up to a certain point, I'm not sure which yet). They do have trading limits of $5000 per sell order per, and a $45000 global limit for selling per day. They do also require verification for sell and deposit orders since 1st Dec to comply with law, and GST is included as far as I know. However, they do hold your private key for your wallets (from which you can transfer immediately if you want to something else).\n\nMtGox is an external exchange and trades AUD as well. Similar to Coinjar you can also have AUD and BTC there at the same time. It normally operates on 0.6% fees and offers advance limit orders for buying and selling. It also requires verification, but depositing and withdrawing from there *is a bitch* from Australia. It is taking forever to verify and withdrawing takes about 4 weeks for AUD (not sure about the time for BTC but I would imagine way quicker).\n\nMy news come predominantly from Coindesk, and obviously this sub and /r/bitcoin.\n\nedit: I did overkill it a bit, you don't have to be so detailed if you don't want to.\n\nedit: MtGox is bollocks.

Second, even if you could work out a legal arrangement, say an unsecured loan, how is the borrower ever going to repay if Bitcoin soars in value by 500 % in 30 days?\n\n\n\n': 6, "If it's pegged to it's dollar value, aren't you really just borrowing dollars?  If it's not, then a change in the dollar value of bitcoin would have no effect; you'd have to pay back the same number of bitcoins regardless of dollar value.": 4, 'You could peg the bitcoin to the price @the time of borrowing. ': -2, '> does not matter as there is no legal requirement that a person must take payment in fiat currency\n\nIs this not what legal tender laws mandate? Sorry if I misunderstood your assertion.': 1, 'Then how would you enforce the contract when the borrower fails to pay? There are no bitcoin courts. Yet. Essentially, lending bitcoins is a horrible idea at this moment in time. ': 1, 'I am assuming anyone who is borrowing in BTC is using it to do something that is also in BTC to avoid any currency exposure. Say you sell and buy in   BTC. If you are not then you better off just borrowing in $. You can also give the borrower a choice to repay in BTC or $ (meaning its like a put option, you are willing to sale BTC with the borrower at X rate). Put exercisable by you. You can also demand the borrower hedge their position by using a forward contract much like what they do in the real world, prob is there may not be any takers given the volatility. I agree that the instruments needed are still immature mainly because the players here are not from the financial industry, it took almost 35 years of deregulation in the financial markets to build many of those tools I mentioned. Just because BTC is not regulated does not mean these tools can be mapped across without understand their workings. My point is that if one horde BTC for speculation or trading depending on frequency then it does not get into the real market, it does not get circulation, there is no multiplier effect and brings no utility at all to society relegating BTC to merely monopoly money status. I wonder if there is any data to show how much BTC is used for real world as compared to trading ?': 1, 'The answer is in the contract. Look at the loan contract and it should be enforceable in a regular court. BTC is not defined as a currency, does not matter as there is no legal requirement that a person must take payment in fiat currency. I can ask to be paid in chickens or grains or anything as long as this is a consideration for me to lend you and the borrower promised to repay BTC. The question to ask when submitting a case rely on 3 questions, whether there is a contract and whether the contract was breach. If yes then what is the remedy ? The remedy is usually spelt out in the contract too. There are other terms that need to be considered in the contract like conclusiveness clauses, no contest as to forum of convenience. You can use the credit card agreement as a template, this is as tight as they can go legally.  ': 1}}}
